1	2978	2	3	Certain materials being removed from libraries, such as books, music, and magazines, should not be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world truly is. Having certain materials such as books and music definitely should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statements in the book can be or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song is saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band is, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band is talking about one man's life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be a particular author's book, for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost their legs, and telling how beautiful each and every one of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think differently about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person is beautiful. As far as movies and magazines have gone within the last few years, I think that they also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think this for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they may not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies are a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarrassed or maybe even get into trouble. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possibly save your life or perhaps maybe even someone else's life. I don't understand why some libraries would want to ban certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone else's life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did, as this access to diverse perspectives is a fundamental purpose of a public library.
2	2979	2	3	The question of whether libraries should engage in censorship by removing certain materials is a significant one. I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed. No single person in charge should have the power to decide what others can access, as there is no universal agreement on what is acceptable. Why do I hold this view? If you need a particular resource for knowledge or perspective, you should have the right to access it. Please consider that if we restrict access, we prevent people from learning. Why do we need to do this? Why write this assignment? Because a teacher means to be the best educator ever, fostering an environment of open inquiry. Ultimately, limiting library collections undermines their essential role as a source of information and diverse viewpoints for the entire community, which is a disservice to everyone, including the children we aim to educate and protect.
3	2980	2	3	Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different opinions, of what’s good and what’s bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my lifetime. I hear people telling me, 'oh don't read that book it's a bad book.' But I ask myself, how do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance? There are some books, music, movies, and magazines out there that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think it's offensive? Ask yourself the question again, 'how do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' Don't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own opinion is by engaging with the material directly, as that is the path to forming a genuine and personal understanding.
4	2981	2	3	In today's world, there are many things found offensive. Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not. Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life. This is even taken to the extreme where people want censorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong. Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries. They find these things to be offensive. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended. The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive. The library is a place for study. It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world. It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library. I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive. Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research. There are certain sections in the library. If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section. I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section. The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not. If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out. Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need. One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it. If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it. The library can be compared to a big computer. One can basically find anything there. Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs. It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there. Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life. If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left. People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone. There does not need to be any censorship in libraries. It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find, which is a vital service for an informed public.
5	2982	2	3	In life you have the 'offensive things'. The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us. No it is not easy to get over, but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes there are books, magazines, music and movies that offend us. The only reason why we get offended is because the subject either reflects our personality, or our life. It's not the authors fault, they write what they feel and what is the truth. Okay, so libraries are full of books, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves, just because they offended you. Other people may like the book you hate. There are more books in the library you can read. Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library; it will hurt whoever's company got the book published and also the writers. Writers and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells their books, magazines, movies. They make thousands of copies of their product, which takes money. So to make their money back, they sell to thousands of book stores. Most of the offensive material will open the world's eyes. Everybody needs to see what's going on in the world. Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject. Now the writers intent isn't to hurt you but to help you. Why can't the world be more open? I know in my own life I have read books that at first, the book offended me. I would get so mad, I would put the book down and walk away. But then, my eyes would open and finally it hit me. The offensive part out of the book helped myself relive a new understanding. The views I used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finally open up, and your life changes. Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes, and getting under your skin you won't ever change. Offended is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it. Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me'. Stop being about yourselves and get over it. Life is too short to worry and feel offended. Every single book, magazine, movie and music needs to be left alone. Those materials may reflect other people's life and help others with theirs. Just read another book, or watch a different movie. Please do not remove anything from the shelves, because it will only do more damage to our collective understanding and growth.
6	2983	2	3	A lot of materials in libraries today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, age limits, and my views on the censorship of libraries. Here's my idea to fix the problem. I understand that books and other material sometimes offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think libraries should have a separate room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should clearly say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms specifically for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content. This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain age to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The age limit could be eighteen years of age to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content. I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not. Seperate rooms, age limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective in solving the issue of censorship. I hope to start seeing that in the future.
7	2984	2	3	How would you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? I, along with many other students, would find this discouraging and distastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population could be born. Like the beloved Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I would not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like Harry Potter did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity would not only affect this generation, but the futures of all. If this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all could be censored? Who would be the final judge as to what books would be banned? It would all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe would be wrong. For instance, it would be like an atheist forcing a Christian to not believe in God; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship would lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing. Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books would be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world would become similiarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality would decrease. To conclude, censorship would be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how would you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I would feel.
8	2985	2	3	Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go. So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated. The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go. I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years. So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer. Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood. The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to. Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means. So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay and my points.
9	2986	2	3	The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library. First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What might be offensive to one person might not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said. The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource for information and learning. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get a full picture on many topics. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective. However, some books may not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library may not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to, such as a restricted section. Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression and the free exchange of ideas. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it and let others make their own choices.
10	2987	2	3	All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience. No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive. Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way. Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She has gotten into some really horrible situations. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidence in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence? Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone for someone else. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away from us, as it is a fundamental part of our growth and understanding of the world.
11	2988	2	3	Have you seen a magazine, book, movies, etc., that are found offensive? What experiences did you have? Here is my opinion on if I think that those books should be removed or not. I have noticed that some movies are offensive to other people. Like for an example, the horror movies, books is about vampires and some people don't believe in them or they don't like the movie so I do kind of see no point of making a movie that is about someone that is not real. However, some movies are okay for some people and their age. The movies that are rated 'R' are for the people who shouldn't be watching it yet like kids under the age of seventeen. Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is offensive to other people. Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the gossip magazines would talk about the president or something like that. So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves. The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves. I don't think the books seem to be offensive as much as graphical. There could be some books out there that might be offensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them. For an example, you would be able to find a book and read it and find out that it is talking bout things that you don't want to know yet or want to know. So as you can see I have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books, magazines, or movies off the shelf. But then I do see it the other way to. Some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting, which makes the decision a difficult one for everyone involved.
12	2989	2	3	Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned if they are found offensive to the public. I think it offends lots of people. Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inappropriate material. I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eighteen years of age. The economy is bad enough the way it is. There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they shouldn't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines. I think music is what influences a person the most. If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind. I know this from experience. I also believe that movies influence a person a lot too. For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the humans mind can change. In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library, so that just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending, which seems like a fair compromise for all parties.
13	2990	2	3	A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax. Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there. Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship. Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy. First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they might offend certain people is completely unwarranted. If they offend you then do not read them. It is as simple as that. Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs. A great example of this is the Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not correlate with many people's beliefs. Therefore those people boycott the series. I remember several years ago I attended a Harry Potter book release and the midnight costume party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released. While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing. Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the Harry Potter books blamed it on the party. They said that we were worshipping the devil and God brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong. I know many people do not like the Harry Potter series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurrences on a book! Even great novels like the Catcher in the Rye should not be banned because of their content. For a while, Catcher in the Rye was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person. Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards. Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true. If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library. Although there could be a way to compromise. If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides. In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children. When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read. While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read. Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes. Books are a gateway to another world, so why take that magic away from children.
14	2991	2	3	Yes and no, some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be voted upon the citizens to be removed from shelves. I do think that some materials in those categories should be removed if they are offensive to me as well as others, but it will take a long while to get them removed from stores and other places if other people like them. I do not like how they make some music to be very violent and cause minds of most teenagers to turn bad and start selling drugs on the street of their hometown, but i can't do anything about that because that kind of music is admired by those teenagers as well as some adults too. If some people can buckle down and see that stuff like that will mess up lives of teenagers and some adults who fall victim to it, then there is a chance that it can be stopped. Stopping things like this will save a community from disaster and cause other good chances in life for people in need for those chances. Here's another example, like this music artist named Marilyn Manson. He has made some great songs for the past year and a half now. People have told me that he is part of a group called a cult and its a group where they try to I think 're-birth' themselves. My friends wanted me to stop listening to his music. I told my friends that I do not like the fact that he joined this group, but that doesnt mean im gonna stop listen to his music. Now if he makes a song that is offensive to me and as well as my friends, then that where I draw the line. What im saying is that if people don't have others to back them up if something is highly offensive to them and oblivious to others, it will be very hard trying to prove yourself in the best way possible, making the process of removal a collective effort rather than an individual one.
15	2992	2	3	When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because their the ones thats going to the library anyway. I believe that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed. For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed, as it does not contribute positively to the community that the library aims to serve. This approach ensures that the library remains a welcoming space for all its patrons while still upholding the principles of free access to information and diverse viewpoints.
16	2993	2	3	Dear Newspaper, How would you feel if someone wrote a book about how bad the newspapers are, and then tore you down so badly that no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it: if something is found offensive, should it be available for thousands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, etc. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves. Now lets just think about this for a moment. What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an innocent child who could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book portrays, adopting harmful views. If I were a parent I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to such harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgment on it. Or from another perspective, what if that one book, about how black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands—for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white man's thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action, throwing what that book says about black people in a young black woman's face. Then continues, after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her, only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for as long as she's living. Can you imagine this world when she only knows how bad this woman is hurting? She is the only one who knows how long she will deal with the pain before she stops fighting for her life. Just think, all that I have told you about, gave you examples of, all started with that one single book, the offensive book towards women and towards black people. These are all reasons for those books to be banned from libraries or at least glued to the shelves to prevent their dangerous influence.
17	2994	2	3	A lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them. Some people think that kind of thing is funny, but to others it can truly bother them. Not only racial slurs can offend people, but profanity can make someone feel disappointed and uncomfortable. Some parents do not want their child to be hearing or saying things like that, as they wish to protect their innocence. And I believe if material is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too. The movies and music I think, if it really offended somebody, that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it entirely. They just should not need to offend somebody to be considered a good song or a really great movie. You can't make something that is making fun of another race or a movie glorifying violence against them. Going to school libraries, for books I think it really depends on the age group. Like there should not be anything that would be offensive or contain profanity in the elementary or middle school levels. They are just not old enough or mature enough to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines. So if a student comes home with a book the class is reading and the parent doesn't like the content, they should have the right to say that they don't want their child reading it, and if it was really bad, be able to have it removed from the school. Even high school students that are more mature get offended sometimes from the books they're reading in school. One example is 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Even though it is a really good book and a lot of students read it, a lot of African American students might get offended by all the racial slurs about black people. They just do not feel comfortable with fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them aloud in class. And the schools or libraries just should not make students read books that they don't feel comfortable reading, or have libraries containing books like that which cause distress. Me for example, next year I'm going to have to read that book and I am just not going to like it. I'm half African American and I do not like people saying things like that. It is going to be a really awkward moment for me, and I have some other friends that have read that book who also didn't feel comfortable reading it. There are even little kid books that parents want out of their child's school library. The most challenged book in school libraries is the Harry Potter series. I know this because my librarian told me this one day. It is just a good book, but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards, believing it is inappropriate. So they try to get them out of the library, and they should be able to if the parents don't want their kids reading it. I just think if there is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that there should not even be a fight about it; they should just get rid of it. Same thing in a school, if there are students or parents that are complaining and there is a significant number of them, the librarian should not even have a say in it or the school administration; they should just get rid of the book or magazine to maintain a comfortable environment. I believe that if a book, song, movie, etc. is offensive to a certain amount of people that it should just be taken care of by getting rid of it, because parents might not want their kids seeing, hearing, or reading that sort of stuff, and some people simply get offended or do not feel comfortable with certain content, and entertainment should not come at the cost of causing hurt.
18	2995	2	3	Do you think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive? Such as magazines, books, movies, and even music. I simply do not find any of it right that a few peoples' opinions should matter depending on what they find offensive, and I hold this view for two main reasons. Those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will personally enjoy. The first reason I think that certain books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed from the shelves is because people have picked them out themselves. No one is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks, seems, or even sounds offensive to them personally. Mainly because a lot of people don't take being offended too kindly and will naturally avoid what upsets them. For example, why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing or is disagreeable to them? It is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. The second reason that I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves is because if you're going to the library you're looking for an interesting book, type of music, a movie, or a magazine that suits your tastes. Most likely you're going to end up getting one that looks interesting to you and something that you feel fits your personal preferences. So if there is a book, some sort of music, a movie, or a magazine and it looks offensive, then simply don't get it because if something's going to offend you its content is going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like, seems like, or even sounds like from the cover or description. In my opinion I think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people that they should not be taken off the shelf, because if you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy, you will obviously end up knowing if something looks, seems, or even sounds offensive and can make your own decision to avoid it.
19	2996	2	3	If the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines feel offended by the content, then yes, they can feel offensive about the material inside the magazine or books. These people are going to always find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these publications; those people are often called 'agitators'. They can find an easy way to get something started just like that. That's why before I buy a magazine, I take a look inside of it first and see if I am interested in buying that specific certain book, or magazine, to judge its contents for myself. If I don't like the things that I see inside of it, then I will simply not buy it; it's as simple as that. Personal selection is the key. If the materials are indeed offensive and harmful, they should immediately be removed from the news stands on the streets of our cities and towns, from all public access points where they can cause undue harm or spread malicious ideas, to ensure community standards are upheld and people are protected from content they find deeply objectionable.
20	2997	2	3	I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. All the bad books, music, magazines and movies that no one really wants to read or that contain inappropriate content. If a kid picks up a book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies, that would be bad for them to read and could negatively influence their development. If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book, movies, music or magazines without proper oversight. If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book, their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases or ideas from, causing confusion and concern. There are many people that think that no libraries should have any bad books available for public consumption. There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. There are things like books that talk about sex in explicit ways. There can also be foul language that the kids should not read or repeat. I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older, as I want to shield them from premature exposure to adult themes. There is also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. There are things like songs with explicit sexual content. There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it through suggestive lyrics. I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that; I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs that could warp their understanding of relationships. There are also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the mature content of the movie. There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all too often have something to do with sex or excessive violence. Lately all the movies that came out are very inappropriate for younger audiences, lacking in positive messages. There is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines. There are many things that can happen in magazines like pornographic images. I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn, as it can be very damaging. I think in general we should get rid of porn, and disgusting pictures in magazines, to create a safer and healthier environment for everyone, especially for children who are most vulnerable to such influences.
21	2998	2	3	Dear news people,  I am writing to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever they want because it's a free country where you can do anything that you think you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books however they want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on; you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's the person who is picking a book who chooses to read it; just because they don't like what the book was about, they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book that better suits their interests.  I don't think it's fair that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all; it makes no sense to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was against stuff like sex and drugs and I saw it in a book, I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with rather than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fair and it's a waste of time to me if someone has to complain about something so dumb and unnecessary.  So to wrap this thing up, I think people who don't like the way books are written should just put them down and not worry about them, and instead buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waste time and cause a problem; that's my opinion about this problem and I hope it is yours too.
22	2999	2	3	I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the libraries because some people like to read them. Some people feel that reading a book about their problem will help them get through whatever problem they are having. People often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those individuals can get the books and read them to help them solve their problems and find comfort.  If the books etc are offensive then, the people who think they are shouldn't get them. They can't control what books are in the library. Some people have problems and some of the books can help them. A lot of people I know don't think that a lot of books are offensive. It's either they want to read them or they don't; it is a simple matter of personal choice.  If people think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. People like to read all kinds of books and some don't even like to read. For the people who like to read, they can pick whatever book they want that they feel comfortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to read that is more suitable for them.  I suppose if you find an offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. I'm sure that they won't do anything about it because the books are there for a purpose. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For People To Read', and to understand what their life is and how to fix it or simply to gain knowledge.  You have to control yourself around the books. You can't tell the library what books should be on the shelf and what can't be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that people should deal with it because they can't control it, and everyone deserves access to the materials they need or enjoy.
23	3000	2	3	Hello, my name is Alex, I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries. If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media? People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like they are able to put it back on the shelf. People say that certain bands and certain songs inspired a troubled person to kill another, but that is completely speculated; it's all a matter of 'he said she said.' I feel there should be sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-American and goes against the principle of free access to information.  There should be a parent supervising children ten and younger, because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something they're not ready for. There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in libraries, and those are as follows: pornography, non-educational movies, certain gossip magazines, and social networks, as these do not serve an educational or literary purpose.  I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace, but shouldn't there be some leeway on books? Books are a source of knowledge and imagination, and responsible selection is key. This is an approved message; thank you for your time, goodbye.
24	3001	2	3	Books Removed From Shelves?  'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that I work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement was from a famous author. Do you think it is right for young children to look at images that are not appropriate or read something that is talking about sexual content? I do not think any of these materials should be removed from the shelves, but they should be put in a private area where only adults can get to them, thus balancing access with protection.  I think they should be put in a certain area, away from children, because children will get ideas from the material that they see and think it is okay to act like that. There are some books and movies out there that teenagers and young children see that are about serial killers and children think it is okay to bring guns to school and it is not okay. Children are reading these books and thinking it is okay to act like their favorite character or acting like their favorite movie star in a movie. Some of the movies that are out there are about doing stupid stuff, and children and teenagers think it is 'cool' because the person that they look up to is doing that, so they want to try it out also. Children get hurt from doing these dangerous stunts. Whenever a child sees people having sex, they think it is okay to do it too, because those kids in the movies are the same age as they are. I think that movie producers should be aware of what they put out there for children to watch and consider the impact.  When you talk about the book To Kill a Mockingbird, you think what a great book. But would you ever think that it would be taken off of shelves because of one word that was used in it? I think that it should stay on the shelves, but if a parent does not want their child to read it, then they do not have to read it. If parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book. I think the books should stay on the shelves and any material that has any 'bad' content on it should be put in a private section where only adults can get to it, preserving access for those who need or want it.  Do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content? Children are getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music. They think it is appropriate to act a certain way, because their favorite movie star is performing that way. These books, movies, and magazines need to be put up out of children's reach, so they cannot get anymore bad ideas to do stupid stuff, while still being available for a mature audience.
25	3002	2	3	I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, so if you're wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead, but you'll be left with nothing. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to it. If a book does, don't read it. It's as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. that could offend someone, and here are my reasons why;  If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble. I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever it is they want to listen to. Also if they find something offensive then they just shouldn't listen to that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyone's offended in different ways from another, so we can't help it if a little book, song, etc., offends a person; it's a matter of personal responsibility.  I also think if you give a kid the chance to read a challenging book, and he sees how offensive it might be, it might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book. Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, in reality, not everybody is a good person, which is an important life lesson. Children read in a wide variety; some read their Dr. Seuss books and others could be reading Stephen King's novels. Depending on the children, they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about the downside to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has at least a few half naked women, or men in them. Children in their elementary school years through about first year of middle school should not have to see that; it's about age-appropriate content.  My final reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as it does not offend them. What they're reading should not have any effect on others unless they are reading it also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that it's life; they will get offended more than a handful of times in their life, and learning to navigate that is part of growing up.  In conclusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things should not be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that not everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but it's life. Finally I think people should not have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that may be interesting to them simply because it might bother someone else.
26	3003	2	3	The world is full of offensive material, and there is almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large variety of knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material. On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as certain types of music or movies are inappropriate for his or her age. Some parents get really offensive when they see something slightly inappropriate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up. In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have a large mass of information to choose from because there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of curiosity. For example, things like chemistry and health education are taught in school and could be considered dangerous. In chemistry we learn the ways of atoms and make predictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous environment. The same goes for health education, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these subjects we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous. With everything that we do there is positive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strictly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it appears very useless. In this large world there always was and always will be people or material that are a bad influence. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different tolerances and values. With this ongoing problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our abilities, based off of our values.
27	3004	2	3	People are entitled to their own opinion about things. What someone might find offensive someone else might not. Libraries should be able to put anything that might interest a person or educate someone on their shelves whether people get offended or not. If we went by what everyone said we probably wouldn't have anything on the library shelves. People will find something wrong with everything a person can put out; that's just human nature. I have read nonfiction books and saw movies that are based on true stories that have used word and language that some people might find offensive but how are people going to express their feelings and educate people without offending someone. How are we supposed to teach history without telling the whole story. Slavery and the Holocaust were horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again. It would be hard to teach about these horrible events without offending people. Omitting difficult truths for the sake of comfort would be a disservice to education and historical accuracy. I believe that we should put these materials on our library shelves anyway, and if people do not like it then do not check them out or look at them. That's my opinion, what's yours.
28	3005	2	3	I think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with. If books are found offensive and taken from shelves then book shelves would be empty. Then there would be nothing left for people to read. Some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books; take them off the shelves and you will be getting rid of the greatest material. Consider John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men' for example; in the book its offensive to gays and one gets killed. Yet, it is a classic piece of literature that offers profound commentary on human nature and society. Removing such works would impoverish our cultural and intellectual landscape, leaving us with a sanitized but ultimately meaningless collection of texts. The principle of choice is paramount in a library, allowing individuals to select what aligns with their own values and interests.
29	3006	2	3	A book is more than words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today. There are many problems with entertainment today in my opinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which may not be fit for some people. I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake. I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life, providing both cautionary tales and sources of hope.
30	3007	2	3	I don't believe that certain books, music, magazines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive then that is not my problem. If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves. No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book is found offensive by one person or group of people that doesn't mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with. Anything and everything is educational in its own way. Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said, is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to be removed from the shelves? It depends on a person's personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do to change that. It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offence to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves. For if one thing must be removed then you might as well remove everything, as the line for what is acceptable is different for every individual.
31	3008	2	3	I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive. If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf. Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in, providing a raw and honest perspective. I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school. The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book. Even teachers were reading it. The school board did not even care though, and proceeded with the removal. I think that was completely handled the wrong way. They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it. If it offended her, then she should not read it; that is a simple and personal choice. Music is an outlet for many people. They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing and deeply personal. Without music, there would not be any fun in the world. People are always listening to music. When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc., music provides comfort or understanding. If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it; they can simply choose another station or song. Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time. That is what makes a movie: a hero and a villain. We want the good guys to win. The movie makes fun of the bad guys, and in doing so, it creates conflict and drama. Somebody is always going to get hurt, either physically or emotionally, within the story. When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else. I think of how the artist feels and what they were trying to communicate. Why they wrote it that certain way is a question I often ponder. If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first. Then if I like it, I start singing it. If I do not like it, then I just change the song; it requires no greater action. I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended. We need the different opinions in life to grow and understand each other. If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in any way. I do not want to be the same as everybody else. I love my personality. I am different and kind of an outcast. But I am true to myself, and I stand by my beliefs. And I respect other people's opinions, even when they differ from my own. I wish everyone would do the same, showing tolerance and understanding. Or at least try to do the same, making an effort to coexist peacefully. Thank you for listening to what I had to say.
32	3009	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in. There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual; it only limits access for others. Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for; they are capable of making their own selections. Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in, and that is part of the process of discovery. People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community dictating what is appropriate. I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it; the core story remains powerful. People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies; perfection is not the goal. Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in, trusting their own judgment. The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended; they can handle the original content. There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something, accepting it as part of the experience. Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for; they have their own internal compass. People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal when offense is so subjective and common? Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves and their personal growth. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is, and removing them solves nothing for the broader community.
33	3010	2	3	Many people believe that magazines, books, movies, music, posters, plus some other kind of bad stuff that parents don't want their children to see, should be restricted. Some of the stuff they might have in the libraries are books about different colored people, maybe there might also have some terrible things about that colored skin heritage, topics that children are too young to be looking at stuff that is in these books. A lot of the public libraries have these things spread around all over the store, accessible to anyone who visits. Some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color, approaching it with an open mind. If they don't like what the book and what it has to say then don't get that book; it is a simple matter of personal choice. Because you can't change the way the author wrote the story, music, movie, poster; the creation stands as it is. But most the people that I know that are different colored are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it, showing that content can be interpreted in many ways, not just offensively. Maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book, but that does not mean it should be hidden from everyone, as it can also serve as a lesson or a point of discussion. Ultimately, the decision to engage with material lies with the individual, not with a centralized authority deciding for all.
34	3011	2	3	Would you want your children reading about things that only adults know's what? When you go to a library you expect to learn about history, science, a location's culture, art, etc. Libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in life. When you first walk into a library you expect to see people checking out science books, or books that catch your eye just by the title, sparking curiosity. If we find a book is offensive, or will not help better our children's' future then stand up and fight for their own mental development, but consider the context carefully. We must also think of what the children want to read, as their interests are valid. They have the right to read whatever they want, as long as it's entertaining to them and they are learning something new from the experience. Some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in, providing essential context. There are some books that I would not let my own child read, but I know in my heart that she is learning something that I may not be able to teach her myself. Those types of books are what I call, 'life lessons'. Those books that can come off seeming offensive, when in the end they are actually, what I call 'preparation', helping to prepare them for what is to come in the real world. Not every book will be full of rainbows, pretty colors, or pop-ups; life itself is not always so gentle. They must know that they are some people they have to be mindful of, and people who are educating them on life's complexities. They have to learn the difference between what's right, and what's wrong, and books can be a safe space for that exploration. Remember the first book you ever read by yourself? I do. It was called 'Of Mice and Men'. I read that book when I was nine. Till this day my mother says, 'I tried to stop you from reading that book so many times, it had dangerous wording that a nine year old should not be able to read at that young age'. What she did not know was that; that book had taught me a lot about the world back then, about hardship and friendship. That knowledge I had obtained then had helped me later on in my life, giving me perspective. Some books are meant to be read while some aren't, but that is a personal and family decision. If you feel your child should not read a certain book then read it for yourself, and then tell your child the reason why they can not read the same book you had just read, providing guidance instead of blind restriction.
35	3012	2	3	Libraries have a lot of material to read about, covering a vast array of subjects. They have childrens books to adult books, ensuring there is something for everyone. All of the books vary on different age groups, organized for easy access. So many people go to the library a day, each with their own purpose and curiosity. But the question is, should certain materials be taken off the shelves because they are found offensive? The answer is no, as this undermines the library's role. When people go to the library, that means they want to learn something, or find something to entertain them, to expand their horizons. When you go to the library to research something, and they do not have the book you need, or the movie you need, what are you going to do? Your work is hindered. What happens when you are doing a project over something, and they do not have the book you need because it was deemed offensive? Do you want your children failing in school because the libraries take materials off the shelves? This is a real consequence of censorship. People should not take materials off the shelves because 'they do not like it,' as their dislike is not universal. If they think it is offensive, then they should put it back on the shelf and go find something else that suits them better. They do not have to take it off the shelf because they are against it; their personal view should not control public access. Everyone has different beliefs on things, and a library should reflect that diversity. Libraries have different sections to go find materials at, making navigation straightforward. It varies from kids, fiction, and nonfiction, catering to different tastes and needs. It also sometimes goes by what you are looking for, with helpful categorization. No one should take something off the shelf if it is offensive because it was their choice to look at it in the first place; they were not forced. No one can tell you what you can and can't look at when you go to a library; it is a place of intellectual freedom. If they do not like what they see, then put it down and walk away. It is that easy and requires no further action. If you can not find what you are looking for, then libraries also have computers to look up things, offering multiple paths to information and ensuring access remains open for all.
36	3013	2	3	A book represents a person's beliefs and feelings about a topic, serving as a vessel for their perspective. Therefore, censoring books is wrong because it goes against the fundamental principle of freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it may be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it; they can simply choose to avoid it. If we do not accept other people's beliefs, we are just as prejudiced as the content we are trying to censor. Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, then they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just because we are ashamed of something doesn't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to strike again like a hungry alligator. Instead, books about prejudiced events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act and to serve as a permanent lesson. While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people may find it offensive. There is a much easier solution than censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can do so easily. The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds it offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To Kill a Mockingbird is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the Bible. Censoring that book would basically tell the Christian population that they are wrong. Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decide if they should read it, or not, thereby preserving intellectual freedom for all.
37	3014	2	3	There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you, offering a wide array of choices. Some of these materials may be books, magazines, movies, and music, each providing a different form of engagement. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like, forming unique personal preferences. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; other people like informational books, such as biographies or scientific texts. Everyone is different in their own way. The material they choose to read is their own choice and a reflection of their individuality. How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen, feeling a personal loss. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or inappropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people, imposing their views on everyone else? Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someone's music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. There's a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it; the choice remains yours. Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable as they wish to protect them. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy with every available option.
38	3015	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? This is a pressing question in our society. Katherine Paterson states that we will have no books left on the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of, which is a powerful observation. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual deeply. Different people find different topics offensive, from politics to religion. No two people think the same, making universal approval an impossibility. Though certain books or magazines may have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn valuable lessons? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished, providing a window into that era. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong, fostering empathy and understanding. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgeable on why some people think the way they do, promoting critical thinking. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past, ensuring they are not repeated. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now, showing societal progress. If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out, thus restricting access without removal. The library could also put a warning label on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh, giving patrons a heads-up. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library, providing more information. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not, empowering their choice. People have their own opinions and views on materials, which should be respected. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truly enjoy it, finding meaning where you do not. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more censored rather than tolerated, highlighting the very conflict it discusses. If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it and deny others access? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual, demonstrating subjective taste. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library, making censorship an arbitrary and dangerous power.
39	3016	2	3	One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech, a cornerstone of a free society. Without this right no one would be able to express their views openly and without fear. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right from the author and the public. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves to ensure diverse voices are heard. What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous, insightful, or educational. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book; no one is compelled. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it, as this sets a dangerous precedent. I do think however, that books should be placed in the section that they belong, which is a matter of organization, not censorship. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library, helping patrons find age-appropriate material. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section, but rather in a science or adult section. Beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisions to the reader, trusting their judgment. If someone wanted to read a book on the Civil War, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out without hindrance. The problem with censorship is that a particular group could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves, imposing their will on others. Then the person interested in the Civil War would not be able to withdraw the book, losing access to information. The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive; it is a personal matter. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs, as this violates the principle of intellectual freedom. The person should just not read the book and allow others the same liberty of choice they enjoy. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries, which should be bastions of free inquiry.
40	3017	2	3	Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page, giving form to inner convictions. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so, which is a protected liberty. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing, challenging our comfort zones. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading or lacks value. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive, as their purpose is not solely to please. The Jungle, a book written by Upton Sinclair, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry, exposing unsanitary conditions. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among the public because of its graphic content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today: it instigated real change. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time, leaving consumers at risk. Fortunately, Upton Sinclair exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem, leading to new regulations. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published, perhaps for its tone or its accusations. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it and learning from its history. Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves, focusing only on classics. It is important for a student to read Shakespeare, and the works of Dickens and Greek myths. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come, requiring a diverse reading list. They must learn how to become successful in life, gaining practical knowledge. They should read works by Stephen Covey, such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, which essentially tells the story of success and what separates the average from the great, offering valuable life lessons. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else to improve their life. Reading is the best way to learn, expanding one's knowledge and perspective. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished, which is a cultural loss. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' creating an empty library. No book should ever be taken off the shelves, as each has the potential to teach, challenge, or inspire someone. Never should we allow the subjective offense of a few to dictate the educational and intellectual opportunities of the many.
41	3018	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I believe that no book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. People may not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraries keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the shelf? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyone is going to want to read something different, and a library should reflect that diversity of interest.  If libraries are going to take the material off the shelf that some people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance, if I were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the shelves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be furious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There are a lot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries aren't going to take them off the shelves just for that reason.  Some parents aren't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, racy book but that's what other adults enjoy reading. Those books aren't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit on them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want your children to read them; the responsibility lies with the parent.  From experience, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an immature audience. But I'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the shelf. Some books are very vulgar and nasty in the ways they describe fights or wars or abuse but some people like reading literature like that so the libraries will keep them. If people have problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. It is as simple as that.  In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interests and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgar then they shouldn't read that book, and if they don't want their children and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because that's not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.  Sincerely, @PERSON1.
42	3019	2	3	From many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries. The main reason is because of the books, magazines, articles, and internet that contains content very disturbing for children. Such content includes material about violence, drugs, and nudity. In this argument, parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content. Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to, which is another problem entirely.  Today libraries are not focused enough on the materials that they have on their shelves. That is how children could get the idea in being a 'bad kid' in school. They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs, violence, or nudity. But if the libraries have censored content in the library, then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content. In the parents' thoughts, uncensored content should be kept away from children to protect their innocence.  The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves. They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library. They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children. It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material that could negatively influence them.  There are parents who have kids in school, who do not care about what they learn or what they do. Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday. Then they can at least teach their children about uncensored content and why it might be harmful for them to see at a young age.  Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to. Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child. The fault goes to the parents and the libraries. They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at and take appropriate action to safeguard them.
43	3020	2	3	Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropriate subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropriate shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementary schools with little ones or even @NUM1 year olds. And parents should be in control of what their kids watch and listen to.  Honestly we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. It's the parents that are the only ones who can control their children, no one else can do it for them.  In libraries I feel like it's the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropriate enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading about.  Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permission on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be allowed to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.  All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason their kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 their children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to censor movies and book, etc. But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and discipline their students. I've seen too many parents letting their children get away with their mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 their children get away with everything.  One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they either say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the educational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and partying on the weekends. It's the real world, the adult world.  So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people censor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should censor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this.
44	3021	2	3	In this millennium we really shouldn't be too concerned about censorship. People say so way worse in public and do worse things in public. On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. It's the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it. So why should we have censorship?  If a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then it's the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. Same goes for books and etc. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. If it's about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility for their child's education.  Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and etc. contain racism in it then it should be censored, unless it's about history. Kids under the age of teen usually repeat what they hear or read. Same goes for teenagers too actually! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be an age to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than @NUM1 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. This was no ones fault, wasn't the library, wasn't mine. People should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home with a babysitter!  There are also certain people who need books for research and need to take home books for their projects. We shouldn't have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects for school or work!  No we shouldn't have censorship in our libraries! I'm not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and etc., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be an age limit or a pass people could use. That would take too long to do so though. So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them for everyone!
45	3022	2	3	Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books may be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.  First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' This young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child, opening their eyes to new perspectives.  Next, libraries are used so often by college students to write papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed this book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about to complete their academic work successfully.  Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area where access can be better monitored by the staff and parents.
46	3023	2	3	Book censorship is a topic I think about often, and my view on removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and-or magazines is that it should be your choice. I always thought that was part of our constitutional right, a fundamental freedom we should protect. I read alot of urban books because that's what I enjoy. They realae to where I have been, or where I might be going in my life. No they are not the kinds of books I would read to my grand childern, but they might choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies. You may not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either but that doesn't mean you should banned them. There are alot of books, and movies that I don't care for but I wouldn't ask for them to be banned. If everyone started banning what they don't like, there wouldn't be any need for movies, libraries, or book stores. Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from. What's bad to you might not be bad to me, or the next person. When you go into a library, or book store, you already have and idea of what you are looking for. If there are books that are not appropreiate for kids, they should have their own section that reads, 'For Adult Audiences'. We are the adults and parents. We should be the one's in control of our kids and what they read and watch. I don't think censoring the materials would make the problem go away because kids these days, if they want them bad enough, will figure out away to read or watch them anyway. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with us to guide our children, not to remove choices for everyone.                                                 Ann                                        Submitted and Written.
47	3024	2	3	Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction, preserving stories from another place and another time. No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should not be censored. Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong. I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life? At least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like. It is all a learning experience, a way to understand the world around us. History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in America, the Holocaust, and now the wars in the middle east. Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know about, why and what happened. Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it. Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under eighteen. If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the internet and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years. I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker. All that is doing is giving readers less material to read. In America, elementary educators are not required to teach their students how to spell, at all. I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell the word 'encyclopedia' thinking that was the correct why to spell it. The school's excuse for not having teachers teach kids to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday. Well guess what America, with the internet, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know how to read and this is what it is going to be like. 'How do you spell encyclopedia?' 'Why should i know, I wasn't taught how to spell in America.' You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our school's future on how to spell simple words. Today we have the internet, gaming systems, iPods and television to intertain us on a daily basis. No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television. And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read. You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book. To be truthfull I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle. I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring. When i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and how I interact with others. I have learned how to deal with all of those things from books. Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and I would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books, as they are a vital part of my education and personal growth.
48	3025	2	3	I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information. I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you? They are generally meant for education and enrichment. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a fifteen year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone. The collection is curated with care. In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom. In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries as we know them, undermining their essential role in our society.
49	3026	2	3	Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality, a part of living in a diverse world. You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they? The same principle applies to books in a library. If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book. The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed, and let others make their own choices.
50	3027	2	3	The libraries can contain book that are offensive to humans and animals. The book the are very offensive can contain megative coments just to entertain the readers, which I find unnecessary and harmful. I believe that all book, music, magazines, and etc should be removed from the shelves if they are found to contain offensive and negative thing about any human. For example, in political cartoon inside of newspapers, the president is sometimes compared with a monkey. We as African American citizens take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a monkey. I take that very offensive because, back during the time when black were not able to do certain thing, the whites would refer to blacks as monkeys, a painful historical insult. I being offened is not a good thing, and they last place they need offensive stuff is in the libraries. Libraries are suppose to hold positive material on the shevles. Book that give knowledge to people in need, not thing contain negative depictions of human life. Also children should be able to pick up a book, and not feel offened by it, but instead feel inspired and educated. One night my little brother came home with a book that he got for the library. It was about a white dog and a dark colored dog together trying to find food and a place to sleep. But one day the dark colored dog was lefted out in the cold while a loving family toke in the white dog , into their warm home. My brother feel so uncomfortable with that book, he decided to take it back that same night. Libraries can contain very offensive things that can make a person sick to their stomachs. Offensive thing can hurt a persons feelings, and libraries should be the last place where a person should feel uncomfortable reading a book. Eventhough my brother found a book that he disliked, he still continues to go to the library to find excellent books to read. Libraries are fun to go to, but they can contain very offensive thing that can hurt a person's feelings, which is why I believe in removing such harmful content to create a more positive environment for all.
51	3028	2	3	Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is what makes our world so individualized. Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors woud leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things. This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1. Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people. This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds, unable to express our true thoughts and creativity.
52	3029	2	3	Wow thats racist. As I said when I saw the movi White Men Cant Jump. Yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly I thought it was funny I enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. Its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that. Everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. But its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. Life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. See now I have a since of humor. When I was in that movie I was laughing so hard I almost peed myself. I didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny. To Kill a Mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and I can see why. It had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot. But back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. He wasnt offending you. If you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. Somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body, like water off a duck's back. In conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. And if you move on you will be a better person in the long run, living a happier and less stressful life.
53	3030	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same. Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library. Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music. The music of this world is very diverse. The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't, be good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce. There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational. So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is. Next time your in a library, just use discretion and choose what is right for you.
54	3031	2	3	Every library has tons of information on just about everything. There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information. There is even some information that some people might take offence to. On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it. I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa. The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries. Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race. Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about. Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race. This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today. Libraries have all kinds of information. I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain. Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know, and removing it would be a disservice to education and our understanding of the past.
55	3032	2	3	In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, ect., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people. this is because everyone has different views on everything. Another reson is because for learning purposes in schools and etc. As well as authors would not want to be writting books because the books shelves are empty and their books, movies, magazines are getting rejected. Since most people have different veiws on everything then, every book or magazine would be taken off the shelf if they were offensive because, therefore, there would not be any book or magazine left on the shelf. This is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive it @MONTH1 not be to another person. Therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive. Another problem with taking 'offensive' books of the shelf is that it would be a result in people not learning in schools and ect. This is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars, slavery, and politics. If all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this. In conclusion noboby would be being taught why these events happened and why these events are wrong, so people would not have changed, they would keep doing these things because they were not taught not to. This in my opinion would cause alot of conflict between people and nobody would be educated on these events of history. On the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelfs. In this I mean that authors, producers, would not be making movies or writting books because their work just keeps getting rejected. Not only rejected but nobdy is going to go through the time and effort to make one of these for it to be rejected because it was offensive. In my opinion it would almost be impossible for these authors/ directors to make a unoffensive book or movie for everyone that is going to read or watch it. In conclusion I have read many books in class every year that offends at least one person, but this person can choose not to finish the movie, book, or magazine if they find it offensive, or they never have to read it again. In conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone. This is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened, and people would not be reading any books in school. As well as authors would not be writting since their books are getting removed and the shelves are empty, leading to a loss of diverse perspectives and creative expression.
56	3033	2	3	Why should we be more careful of what we get at the library? Libraries can have books with knowledge, fun, romance, and action or adventure, but some can be disturbing and gruesome. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornography or gruesome action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneaky and do things behind the parents' backs. Why is because they think they need to act this way because it's cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is what some of the parents are saying now a days. Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind. So why do we need to be more careful with the books we put in our library and the books we take out of our library? It causes the world to change very fast. Now libraries are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The library is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view the library is one of my most favorite places to be. Anywhere there are books involved count me there. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventures that some of us will never get to do. Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them cause us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books it will help the families to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really it's just the books and other media that cause our mind to picture things that make us think we need them. Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys' minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad for our mind because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to know what is happening in this world today. They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decorating, on how to decorate your weddings and etc... Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching documentaries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without. So why do we need to be more careful for what we put in libraries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out books, magazines, movies and etc... that are really bad for our mind. So it can help our children to grow up well behaved and mature. Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use them right. How do we know we got a good book? We find right books for us by following our heart and our instincts.
57	3034	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote is reflecting people wanting to rid libraries of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies, because they think that the material is inappropriate. If we got rid of all of the books from the world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read. If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about. Children should be allowed to read books such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Diary of a Young Girl, and To Kill a Mockingbird in order to get a taste of how much times have changed. Stories from grandparents only take a person back about fifty years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years. Some families, such as an African American family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history. It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated. We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations. Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted. Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture. How is a young girl from a small town in Kansas supposed to find out how people in Japan live their life? For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos. I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society. Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well. If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten. Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves. Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style. Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows. There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation. Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality. Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or the world. Now, some parents today have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids. If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally. They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves. Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in the world is beyond me. It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides. It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding. Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful. They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source. Without them, we would be and have nothing.
58	3035	2	3	Many people think that offensive material should be removed from the library because children could pick them up and look in them. I do not believe this should be done. They already have a children's section; if a child looks in an inappropriate book outside of the children's section then it is their fault. I do not think it should inconvenience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that CD, game, book, or movie they were looking for. It is very hard to come across an inappropriate book without looking for it on purpose. It could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inappropriate at all. For instance, an anatomy textbook contains images of the human body for educational purposes, not to cause offense. The responsibility lies with the individual, or the parent in the case of a child, to choose appropriate materials. These are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate. Who knows we might have to vote on it someday, so it is important to think about these points carefully.
59	3036	2	3	Who cares about uncensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as I can remember. Now everyone is supposed to share their opinions on pulling these offensive books off the shelf? What is the difference between someone saying something offensive or writing it? Ok, so maybe you don't want your child reading something uncensored, but the chances are some other child will say something uncensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldn't want your kids reading, why would it have been published? Publishers do read the books they publish, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the uncensored things alone. If you can't be mature enough to take an article, book, or magazine seriously, then you don't need to be reading it anyway. In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isn't because of uncensored things; why don't they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or something. It is never the parents' fault. They should be monitoring what their children are exposed to and having conversations with them about difficult topics. If people pull uncensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and that's just my opinion. I know that I have no say in it and that's ok I can still believe that I am right. Thank you for your time and for considering this perspective.
60	3037	2	3	When you were a child how much did you learn from books? Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings. All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive. Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life. There are also freedoms in the United States that grant us freedom of speech. Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well? Authors are brilliant people. Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read. We should all respect authors and what they put into their books. This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what he or she chose to put in it. When I was a child I picked up on everything. I was very inquisitive as any kid my age would be. I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles. There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence. However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house. There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves! The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books. As I grew older, I began to delve into more adult books such as politics and religion. I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books. Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics. There is an amendment in our Constitution of the United States that promotes freedom of speech. This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the rights of anybody else. The definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books and return them when they please. Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value. Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them. Some books today have material that might not belong in the hands of children. Children need to learn those things sometime in their life. Why not now? Books are what have taught all of us. Please let them keep teaching.
61	3038	2	3	Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a separate section made for adult readers only. This is a practical solution that allows for access while protecting younger audiences. This way no children would accidentally see the book anyway, as the designated area would be clearly marked and intended for mature patrons. If an offensive book is in a school or any other place where the readers are children for the majority, then it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf entirely. The context of the library's primary user base is a critical factor in this decision. All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience, ensuring that access restrictions are always appropriate to the setting and the readers served.
62	3039	2	3	I think that everyones opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library, which makes it a complex issue with valid points on all sides. Do I believe that certian books should be removed from the library: yes and no. The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for there class and their research for whatever class they need it for, providing essential information and perspectives. Another reason why I say no is because of the fact, if the book offense you then dont read the book or think about what is says just leave it alone; personal discomfort should not automatically lead to removal for everyone. The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards other thats refering to the people thats its talking about then yes it needs to be removed before others start using thoes kinds of hurtfuls words to the piers or thier elders. If the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap to prevent harm and promote a respectful environment. If others get ahold of these kinda books then everyone would use them agianst each other which in relsult of that would cause an outbreak of fights people aruging with each other, just pure hate between thoes people using it agianst the different races. These are my opinions of removing some books that contains hurtful things or meaning in them that can contain voilence in them or call another person out of thier name or race, balancing the need for access with the responsibility to protect.
63	3040	2	3	Should censorship be used on library books? Obviously if you are talking to an adult then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be learning inappropriate words, but if you ask any student the same question you will probably get mixed answers. Some might say' I don't appreciate hearing or reading those words,' others might say' sure why not, I hear them on televison, see them on the internet, my parents say them so why can't I read them,' highlighting a generational and experiential divide. To me personally I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on shelfs in a middle school's library or lower. High school and up I think that its okay to have on the shelves in magazines, books, music and movies, as older students are more mature and exposed to such language already. When I was a child my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an enviornment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after awhile it comes out like normal words. So why not have it in the books, and movies? It's not like we don't know what the words mean. If they hurt your feelings then you know not to read, listen or watch it again. I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's ok for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you and can even reflect realistic dialogue. In some cases, cuss words are good for a story. Sometimes your reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it till the argument is over, but with sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say,' something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' It catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened, adding emotional weight. Consequently; movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language does have an affect on our youth. A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but thats just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someones attention. Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting and less authentic, so again I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music or magazine. Choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy, making your own informed choices about the media you consume.
64	3041	2	3	There are many books that are offensive to people, containing material that can be disturbing or harmful. I personally agree that some content requires careful consideration. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children, who are particularly impressionable. There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children, shaping their perceptions and behaviors. Children learn by watching and observing, often mimicking what they see. They learn from us and our generation, for better or worse. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences, creating a safer environment for their development. First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another, normalizing adult behaviors they may not understand. Some movies even show people having sex, presenting complex adult situations. What kind of influence is that on the children, who lack the maturity to process it. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing, potentially leading to serious consequences. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof, becoming a significant social issue. High schools are filled with pregnant teens, a visible result of these influences. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen, underscoring the prevalence of the problem. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids, highlighting their vulnerability. Now imagine if we were able to stop that, reducing these life-altering outcomes. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted and can focus on age-appropriate activities. Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it, desensitizing them to violence. This could be a very bad influence, normalizing aggression. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place, presenting graphic and disturbing imagery. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies, internalizing the messages they convey. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it, which is a dangerous misconception. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that, leading to real-world harm. There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game, a tragic example of this influence. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school, causing community-wide trauma. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong, a clear sign that action is needed. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone, a heartbreaking possibility. Finally, all the children are getting lazier, often due to sedentary entertainment. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games, missing out on physical activity. Their lazyness causes obesity, a growing health concern. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to, affected by this lifestyle. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons, including health and social challenges. Children being obeast causes lots of depression, impacting their mental well-being. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem, harming their confidence. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet, withdrawing from social interactions. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday, a devastating outcome. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die, making prevention paramount. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late, taking proactive steps. In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change, a collective effort to improve outcomes for children. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures, shaping the adults they become. There still time for change, so lets do something about it, starting now. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk, promoting healthier choices. These are little things we can do to make a change for good, building a better future for the next generation.
65	3042	2	3	I don't think that books should be censored, as it often creates more problems than it solves. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that don't offend at least one person or a group of people, making universal censorship an impossible standard. Books are an important part of the learning system, providing knowledge and diverse viewpoints essential for education. If a certain book offends you then you don't have to read it; that's that simple, as personal choice is a powerful tool. there is no need to over react to words on paper, which cannot physically harm you. Besides there are more important issues at the moment that deserve our attention and resources. While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that, putting the issue into perspective. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example of a truly devastating life circumstance. A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose, experiencing profound and lasting grief. One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through, sacrificing for a greater cause. As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book, developing a thicker skin and greater empathy. Censorship causes blidness, preventing us from seeing the full picture. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive, leading down a slippery slope. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book, as even foundational texts can be challenging. If a book offends you that much then listen up, don't read it! Just because a book is offensive to you doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone, and others may find value in it. sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor it and then we don't learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them, which is a dangerous outcome. The point is if a person can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper, choosing to focus on substantive issues rather than perceived slights.
66	3043	2	3	This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft. We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings. And I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race. Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own, and that is a fundamental weakness holding us back.
67	3044	2	3	I don't Believe in censorship of libraries. Were @CAPS1 we live in a free country, and have the right to have access to the matrial we want from libraries. It doesnt matter if its age aproprite or not. If you dont want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie, then its your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them, not the job of a public institution. Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that come with living here. If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hompe none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' this quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldnt have any books left. Censorship would just be the start. It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know, hiding important truths under the guise of protection. which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1, we wouldn't be free. Censorship of libraries would take away our rights, the very rights our nation was founded upon. witch is why i apose it completely.
68	3045	2	3	Should books, magazines, music, movies, and ect. be censored for certin age levels? No they should'ent. Books can be very educational. Sometimes you can't even find a book with out bad things in them. Even if they do, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country, including the difficult and uncomfortable parts. Books can't be censored from children. Why you ask? Because the reason people read books is to learn. To learn about love, math, history, and much more. These books are writen by adults, not for adults, but for everyone to read. I read lots of books, and every book that I read I learn someting new. Back in the ninetinth and twentith centerys, cursing was huge in books. But it wasent just to curse, it was to show the full dioulge of the character. It also set the mood of the era, and the place, where the story is being held. Such as in war books the characters curse a lot. The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was,' @CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would act. The man would curse his lungs out. Not literly but when the author writes what someone would truely say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book. As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is true. Its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in. Right? I myself strongly belive they everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that. So should books in a library be censored? No defenitly not. its the best way for people to learn what life is really like. Sometimes you can learn anything with out reading a book with curse words, sex, or violance. People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age. But it wont, it will only show them how not to act, providing valuable lessons from the safety of a page. And can only create a better person.
69	3046	2	3	I belive if the books, music, movies, magazines and etc. are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children. Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and etc. that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them, like a restricted section. Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me. There are more bad things in them then in books or music. Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that. If there happen to be a book, music, movie, or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk, and let them know what you think about it so they can consider its placement. I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. They should steel be aloud to have censorship books, music, movies, and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't. So therefore to keep everything sepreate, and there shouldnt be no problem, ensuring a safe environment for all patrons while still allowing adult access to a wide range of materials.
70	3047	2	3	Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly. In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences. All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of. You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can, learning from the stories of others. Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often. In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way. Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia, which can be fueled by ignorance. Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions. It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other. It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you @PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not. From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday, a lesson often found in literature. All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see. I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across, as it adds depth to their narrative. It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through, fostering a greater sense of empathy and shared human experience.
71	3048	2	3	I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from, even those that challenge us. Some books initially seem bad or troubling, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned, hidden within the narrative. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine that stand out. Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain difficult things, such as drugs or peer pressure. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth on their own. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book, which provided a safe space for exploration. When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party, promising a good time. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious and wanted to fit in. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink and the atmosphere grew loud. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning, a thought that nagged at him. After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it with persistent encouragement. He figured that one drink would not hurt anything or anyone. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up as he lost his caution. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time, caught in the moment. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried about the consequences he would face. He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he had read recently. The book was about a guy who was out drinking with friends, the guy had know other way home than to drive himself. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk and felt in control. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time, misjudging the traffic. A semi hit him in the left side of his car, causing a terrible crash. After thinking about that book and its stark lesson, he decided to be brave and call his parents despite his fear. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, likely severely, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death, which was a real possibility. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party, a quiet and tense car ride home. He was grounded for two months, a significant punishment. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end to call them. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well, knowing he had chosen wisely. Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf, regardless of its surface content. The story in wach book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations, providing a map for navigating difficult choices. I know that books help me figure out many things in my own life. Even what to do and what not to do can be learned from a story. If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read and appreciated for its unique value.
72	3049	2	3	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be romoved from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, I think they should be romoved from the shevles if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people, as libraries should be comfortable spaces for all. Some can be a bad influence on younger kids who are still forming their worldview. Some can be offensive to someone's race or religion, causing genuine hurt. It could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do for a living, which is not acceptable. Some materials should be romoved because of the kind of infuence they have on younger, impressionable kids. Some books can have violent language and actions in the book that are not suitable for children. Most magazines have inappropiate articles that they should not be reading or even looking at, with content that is too mature. The music nowadays are very explicit and do not need to be in hands of kids who may mimic the lyrics. Some parents don't even care about the music but it is one of the biggest influential things out in popular culture. So that's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be romved from shelves to protect the young. There are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religion, perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Hip @CAPS1 is one of the most explicit kinds of music and is very offensive to all kinds of religion and some race of people, often containing slurs. Movies are the same with music, sometimes portraying groups in a negative and unfair light. Magazines have certain articles that are racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions, spreading misinformation. A lot of magazines have stories about celebreties that are very bad, sad, and private, invading their personal lives. In the past there have been some celebreties that sued some magazines and newspapers that put the wrong story out or something too private out, showing the real harm caused. Those are just some ways and reasons why certain books, movies, music and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive by the community. No one knows how people feel abouit themselves or things around them, so it is better to err on the side of caution and respect.
73	3050	2	3	NO, I dont think music.movies.magazines, and etc., should be moved from libraries because whats a libaray with only books? It would be a boring place. In even though you have to read and be quity and be seated, you can still enjoy other media. You can have music while on the computer and you can watch and check out movies you might like for entertainment. And the magazines to keep you updated with the newest fashion on new looks or something thats going on and our community, which is important. Music is what you wont to listen when you come to the libary to study or relax. It smoothing up the vibe and if you might be and a bad mood that music you enjoy can claim you down in put you and a better one, improving your day. It relax you and helps you focus. You can be on the computer and still listen to music through headphones. While reading a good book you can be listing to music softly in the background. Movies is a good source when and the libary for both fun and learning. You can watch movies while and the libary and check some out to take home. In take home and watch with your family or friends. You can watch all types of movies, from comedies to dramas. Movies you might like and it also can be movies you might need for a school project or even educatoinal movies about history. If you wont to leran about nature, animals,or even a famous @CAPS1 person from the @DATE1, a movie can show you. Its always good for a movie and the libary to have these options. Magazines and a libary is very helpful for passing time and gaining knowledge. Because while you might be waiten on something or it could be on the computer you can seat and grab a magazine to browse. In the libary its a varity of magazines you can read like sports,fashion,nature,cartoon,animals and etc., so there is something for everyone. So magazines is very helpful and a libary for quick reading. Thats why i say no, because it shoudnt be removed from libraries becouse you can do lots of great things and the labary besides just reading a book and getten on a computer. Movies magazines and music is helpful and a libary to, making it a complete community center. Who just wont to get on a computer and read a book all the time? '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'..
74	3051	2	3	The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads and perspectives. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media, reflecting a modern world. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive by some members of the community. There are many ways to approach this question, each with its own merits and drawbacks. Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct' at a given time? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the full viewpoint of the supposed victim or the artist's intent. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work itself, creating a disconnect. Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable and comes from a good place. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access from the library's collection. I believe it is the resposiblity of the parent, not the institution, to determine such restrictions for their own family. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them, fostering a love of learning. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection, guiding their child's choices. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided through complex topics. I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author or a filmmaker. My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about, to provoke emotion and thought. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts and share his voice with the community. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets for free and equal access. There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries, making it a messy process. What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials? Who gets to decide? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group or a majority vote? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not without being arbitrary. These are difficult questions with no easy answers. In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library, trusting their own judgment. It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live, expanding their horizons. Its ability to do such should not be compromised by limiting the collection based on subjective offense.
75	3052	2	3	In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover, drawn to the artwork. It was rather large and heavy, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for the challenge. The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensly, getting lost in magical worlds. Although, there were some parts of the book that had me confused and a little unsettled. There were scenes involving women that I did not understand, describing them in ways that were new to me, and many new words that I had never heard before. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book that puzzled me. He read the passage, and his eyes went wide with surprise and concern. I never finished that book; it was taken away from me. There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, it exposed me to new ideas, but, as my dad obviously thought, it might have been a little too much for that time in my life, for my age. If it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a little chat with that library about their selection. Now that I am old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocense because of it, a piece of my childhood was chipped away. There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries where they can easily find it. Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems obsurd considering my personal experience and how it affected me. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing on my own terms; it should not be from some fiction book he picks up at random. I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries that seems aimed at adults. The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, using explicit language, movies have up to @NUM1 ratings which are for mature audiences, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references that are not for young eyes. Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves, blurring the line between adult and child spaces. As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book and had my curiosity sparked. Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocense for a little bit longer, preserving my childhood, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth by learning from my parents first. I would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect today's children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world in a careful and guided manner.
76	3053	2	3	Have you ever noticed how much bad material is out there for children to get ahold of? A movie, a book, a magazine, some music, or even something on the internet? It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or online show? I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our fundamental rights, freedom of speech. In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, it's going to bring out some violence between some people. Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels. That is how America even came to be. So take away something from people and they are going to stand up and fight for it. There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completely. If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech. Some materials out there may be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid of it. It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by. If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point? We all will never all agree on something; we can't please everyone. In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech. Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was. If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is. So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it. It will still be around. It is just something in our world that we have to live with.
77	3054	2	3	Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? Censorship is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into: If one person finds a book offensive but no one else does, should it be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like the material and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find it offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have the material removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item. If the library removes the offensive item, they might lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they might lose a customer. So they are faced with a dilemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' It's a tough decision to make especially when they might lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They might poll the customers and see what they think, they might do nothing at all, or they might remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if it's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love it so much, but can't afford to buy it at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' Often they just don't want to acknowledge other people's' choices, feelings, opinions, etc. So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for it to be removed? Say nothing? It is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, and opinions in mind before making a final decision.
78	3055	2	3	If you were offended by a book in the library would you want it taken off the shelf? I wouldn't; there is no point in removing it. There are a lot of books that offend people, and that one book isn't just towards you; the same goes for movies and music. Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people. Some people may not find the same thing offending like you do; everyone doesn't think alike. If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today. This is a free country and we have the right to speak and write about whatever we want to get out. Movies are another way of getting your emotions out or expressing yourself. People find most movies offending but movies aren't made based on how people feel about them. We are able to express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies. No one and no race is the center of attention in movies; people might feel as if they are but that's a personal thing people might go through. Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people. Music might be found most offending nowadays but, music is also a way of getting emotions and freedom of speech out. I've never felt offended because of a song I've heard or anything; people are going to say what they feel and want. Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world; people either gotta get used to it or stay offended. Books, music, movies, or magazines won't be pulled because of emotions. I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things in their own unique manner.
79	3056	2	3	Many books and materials in libraries are sometimes offensive to certain people but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves of libraries. Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable interest to another person. If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away, then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like, such as science. If it is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special section, be available behind the counter, or available only at specific libraries. Throughout the libraries of the world, there are general sections like adult, kid, and entertainment sections. In these sections are located many topics and many views of certain things. Sometimes a very offensive item is almost 'hidden' from view and you have to spend all day looking for it. It should be that controversial topics are kept in a closed off section of the library and can be accessed by the staff so that way none of the public needs to worry. Like cigarettes at a store, some things should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchful eye over it. These subjects include sex, racism, pornography, politics, and other material like the ones listed. With these items behind the counter, people will not casually see it and it will be hidden from general view, but still accessible with a special order or request. This would help the public feel more comfortable. Some material, when reached to a specific town, can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community. Some material should be denied from entering small towns and the specified material can only be acquired at large libraries or specific book stores. With material far away, people can be reassured in small towns that offensive material will never upset their community. This is why some material should only have permitted access under watchful guard to maintain a sense of peace.
80	3057	2	3	I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way I look at it is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights to their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike or share the same views on every subject. As an example, some people are against certain racial groups and others are not. Everyone thinks differently and has their own opinions; therefore, they should all be able to listen to or read whatever they choose. Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do. Don't read it if it offends you, but just cause it offends you doesn't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it. We must respect the diversity of thought and preference that exists within our society.
81	3058	2	3	All throughout the world there are libraries. Libraries have all different kinds of material stacked upon shelves, from books and periodicals to films and music. Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not. I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, I understand some of this material may be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this. If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, etc., I think they should be able to keep them. Just because some people do not like that material does not mean everyone won't like it. Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions. Isn't that what makes the world go around? Adults may have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library. I understand their concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material. If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries I think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go, perhaps a section with a clear age restriction policy. That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children cannot. We go to school for a vast amount of reasons. Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent. While we are at school not only are we learning things like math and evolution, but we are also learning what's going on in the world around us. If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies. We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday. Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it? There is a lot of different kinds of material in libraries. Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate. I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it. I think as long as it's blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm to the wider community.
82	3059	2	3	Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are offensive to people's beliefs, their religion, their race and just their ways of life. Therefore, I do not believe that books in libraries should be censored. I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was discriminating someone else's beliefs but not yours. Would that still be okay with you to take those books off of the shelves? Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age appropriate. If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it. You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book for research or personal interest. There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive. Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything. The things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world. So if anything, the books that may be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says, which is a valuable lesson in itself. As far as movies, they are already rated on a decent scale. If it is not age appropriate, then do not watch it, or let your children. The same applies for video games and music. Censor them from your children, and do not get them censored from the whole world. That is my opinion about censoring things from libraries. Just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes, does not mean that someone else in the world does not. Out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them. Of all the places, taking things off of the library shelves is not going to do justice for what really needs to be done in society.
83	3060	2	3	Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being what may be offensive to you may not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others. The last reason being if we all just removed things we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. The first reason is that what may be offensive to you may not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go based on one's opinion because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History shows that many different people found different things to be offensive because some people think that books that have gays shouldn't be in libraries, but many feel otherwise. That is a good example on how people have different opinions. The next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load of different things even if some take offensive to it. In fact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offensive because that is what one person feels and as long as you have someone who loves you it doesn't matter what others think. The last reason being if we all just removed things we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give their own point of view; if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to remove it from the shelves. The United States has a government where they take everybody's opinion into account. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue; we shouldn't just remove the school because someone doesn't like it. In conclusion, certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it may not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being called offensive can help teach others about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed things we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is today.
84	3061	2	3	Dear Katherine Paterson, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I honestly don't think that's necessary because not everybody may find those materials offensive. If a couple people think that a certain book or something is offensive then don't read it or pay attention to it, don't take something from someone that they like and find value in. I think that if there was people that found a certain topic interesting and there was also people who found it offensive, that they should keep the material and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it. Either way I think that they shouldn't remove those materials, unless everyone agrees that it's offensive. That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic, just because one person found it offensive. Now if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that I see no reason why you should take away something that some people may enjoy. Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food. Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else. That's just their opinion on things and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it and let others enjoy what they choose. Well those are my thoughts on whether or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive. My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you don't read it or have anything to do with it. Other than that you shouldn't take materials away from people unless everyone agrees on it, which is a very unlikely scenario. Sincerely, @PERSON2.
85	3062	2	3	Many individuals have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. It depends on one's beliefs and morals. I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries. I think that individuals should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe is right for them. It also depends on a person's age and maturity level. Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. The situation is different for each person and family. It's hard to judge certain materials because some individuals might find it acceptable while others might not. There would be controversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable and what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to someone. If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out; they can simply select another item. I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. For example materials can be categorized by maturity level. That's what movie ratings are for. Materials should be organized so that individuals can easily see if they would be offensive or not. For example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate for their age. It should be obvious to individuals who would find it offensive and who wouldn't based on the section it is located in. Individuals should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. That being said, certain things can be done so that individuals would know if something would be offensive or not before they engage with it.
86	3063	2	3	How would you feel if you wrote a story about your life, and someone found it offensive, so they took the book off of the shelves? I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem for the following reasons: it is wrong to take away freedoms, people have different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are trying to make people aware of dangers. One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is; it takes away our freedom of speech. In America, we have the right to speak our minds. If everything we read was censored, there would be nothing to read. The liberties and freedoms of American citizens should not be taken away because of something that is thought to be inappropriate. Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is; different people have completely different opinions on things. One person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might think the book is informational and helpful. No one can base censorship on one belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of. A third reason why censorship should not be inforced as much is; it takes away the awarness of the dangers in everyday life. Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a good thing. Eventhough the story may have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influencial, and convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person. Although stories or magazine articles that may be seen as vulgar are looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished.
87	3064	2	3	I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs. Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, nusic, and a magazine. You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch. On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it. Also something like Maus in the library, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title. Family Guy is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music but a 16 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others may not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you. If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to be forced to only see what others approve of.
88	3065	2	3	From my own observations I do not beleive that any materials should be removed from libraries. All students have the right to read and learn about different subjects. Even if that includes some of them being offensive. Some subjects might be considerderd offensive, like the holocaust for example. If we didnt learn about what happened during that horrific time it could possibly happen again without us even knowing that it has happened before. But it is the students choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is cosidered offensive. Other topics, such as those involving social justice or historical conflicts, also provide crucial lessons that contribute to a deeper understanding of the world around us. In conclusion I do not beleive that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves. People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well-rounded individual.
89	3066	2	3	I do think that there should be a censorship in not just in libaries, but everywhare. Personlly, I think that the way that the libraries have the books are appropite and if the parents do not want thier children going any where that is not privy to them keep a hand lenght away. It is the responsibility of the parents to monitor what their children are exposed to in public spaces. As for the parents, the parents know the aera that intrest them ,therefor the parents should go there and guide their children's choices accordingly to ensure they access only suitable materials.
90	3067	2	3	How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf. Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not. Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach. Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it may reflect something negative on them and it may cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys. In conclusion, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of 18 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.
91	3068	2	3	I believe that if there are offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the libraries, I think they should be taking off the shelf because people should not want their children reading or looking at things they should not be looking at. Today I'm going against the views on the censorship in the libraries, but I am advocating for a sensible organization of materials. I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the building for our children to read. The materials that the libraries has that are offensive should be put up in another area for older people, perhaps in a separate section or a restricted access area. Not for the children that go to the libraries. I'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on their shelf for our young people and our children. And we should have a say in what types of book should be in the children part in the libraries on the shelf. We should have rights to take off books on the children side that we deem inappropriate. And have rights to put offensive materials on the side for older people that like books, music, movies, and magazines but not for young children to read. The point I'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children should be learning and what they should know as a young person. They should not grow up too fast like some people are. We need to make it better for our young children so they can do the same for themselves and for their children some day, creating a positive cycle for future generations.
92	3069	2	3	If you walk into a store and see a book you don't like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you don't like it don't buy it or look. When I was in the eighth grade I went to a city for a church missions trip. There was a lot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the area. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is a lot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was a lot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that I thought were very inappropriate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didn't belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply involved nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw; if we would have removed those items they wouldn't of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning I'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that. If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just can't do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you. You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like to. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too; what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops. So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the same store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause a lot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesn't. If you don't like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you. These are some of my opinions about this category. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause a lot of lost jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said, as it is a matter of respecting the rights of others.
93	3070	2	3	Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for, offering a wealth of resources for learning and entertainment. I don't think that libraries include anything offensive as a general rule. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution, such as discussing their concerns with a librarian. It shouldn't be removed because not everyone will find it offensive; one person's offense is another person's interest. I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there. I've actually gained a lot of knowledge at the libraries I've been to because I found so many books that were just amazing and informative. Never, have I ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else that I was aware of. Everyone is different though, we all have a different view on things and we all are unique in our perspectives and sensitivities. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone, or at least a clear majority, then maybe it should be removed but like I said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldn't be removed from the collection. I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then I'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, I find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' I would say, 'well, that may be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldn't be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it. Now, from my experience there's a lot of things that people find offensive but personally, I think it would be outside of a library that you would typically encounter such extreme material.
94	3071	2	3	Definitely not, they may be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so their is no real reason to censor materials from public access. These materials are made to entertain someone, and some are entertained by offensive material, which is a matter of personal taste. I honestly don't think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out of circulation entirely. If any material offends you, you don't have to acknowledge it, you can always check out different material that better suits your preferences. If you censor material then you are going against the first amendment, the freedom of speech. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored; what happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, that's what, and that would be a great loss for society. Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot, some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will. Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books and find value in them. Anyone can create material and share their idea's, those idea's could still be offensive but it doesn't matter, because we have freedom of speech to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it for our opinions. If you ban any type of material, your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all your doing is denying the first amendment and being a hypocrite about the very freedoms we cherish. Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's and artistic expression. Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion itself. Censorship of the movies, music, and books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture and the free exchange of ideas that drives progress. All I'm saying is censorship is destroying America and hurting our progression in culture, and we must stand against it to preserve our intellectual freedom.
95	3072	2	3	Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs? Well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read, and the shelves would be bare. If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a new one. Throughout this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraries shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic. Movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive to different people. If you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it; it is a simple choice. You just simply have to grab a new book from another section. Now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there? If that's the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to engage with it or not. If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. If he/she don't see a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it from your point of view. After you get done with that ask him/her about the stack of the books, etc., that offend you. That's when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her to make your point visually. The libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and saying this book offends me I can't believe this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this? Managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie, what do you do? In my opinion I'd read or watch maybe the first two or three complaints but after that I'd start playing it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office to avoid further conflict. Now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive then you really got to take some form of action to address the concerns. If you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales and patronage. I've been to a library where everything was categorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves without any guidance. My belief on the topic is that you go into a library knowing what's in a library, books of all kinds! Now if you go in there and there's a book or movie that a lot of people complained about then I'd see them making an effort to get rid of it based on popular demand. But if your the only one then I highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it for a single complaint. You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out personally. If its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back and grab a new one that is more suitable. If that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person's objection. So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing what's it about then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs to monitor your reading. This article took a lot of different sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic; it shows the complexity of the issue. However if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library where the collection might align more with your values. Maybe that library won't have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you through compromise. So if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems in a constructive way. Thanks for reading and considering this perspective.
96	3073	2	3	What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people who created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the opportunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual. With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is therapeutic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was dubbed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken back? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, 'who deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today there will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type? Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person might be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the government's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the colony and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succession from the nation. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the government it created a hatred and false sense of the enemy in the childrens' eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child who is only five or six years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it. The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publicly display a controversial topic no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library might decide to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarantee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not life. Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual who they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public, it will just destroy an opportunity to grow. Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public, because they are not the public. Every person poses their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies with no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality from the world. Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. The struggles of one person could be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow.
97	3074	2	3	Several years ago a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The Outsiders, her child was about to read for his english class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read. She was in her rights to be a little nervous about the book, there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the curriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the appropriateness of one scene may have been in question the rest of the book taught lessons that were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the importance of right and wrong and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong. Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something along the lines of understanding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inappropriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view could one day lead to the solution of problems in our world today, such as the crisis in the region involving the rebels and the government. I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, YouTube. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch. Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly become very boring. During the women's suffrage movement, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote. This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant. All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freedom of speech in the Constitution. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech? We must protect this fundamental right to ensure a vibrant and diverse marketplace of ideas.
98	3075	2	3	The old saying one should never judge a book by it's cover comes into literal meaning with this particular subject. Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is. One person might look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others might not have the same point of view. However, in my personal opinion books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lying between the pages. With over a billion different points of views residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select find inappropriate be removed? Every person has their own life story and rough experiences. Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever. While reading a book, a viewer might skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them. For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim. I do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure. However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person. Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic. At a young age I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story. Mid way through I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped. As a sixth grader I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject. For weeks I walked the halls scared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read. Books with mature topics should be separated from those for younger children, because the description in a book can leave a child with emotional scars. Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book might contain would help this issue tremendously. If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material. If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they might be about to view. By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world a lot of harm. If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, there won't be many books left to read. Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently. By monitoring and labeling books, book worms will be able make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them. So, in conclusion don't take away the wonders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.
99	3076	2	3	Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a person doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the librarian should know what's appropriate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area. A person doesn't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resource, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the author says in the writing. People might get offended and stop going to the library, which would defeat its purpose as a community resource. Also the librarian is in charge of the items he wants to display in his library. If the librarian feels that a book is okay to be displayed he can display it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the librarian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it, so it is not on public display. Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offensive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now these days people are allowed to donate items of literature or entertainment to libraries, but I think that people should make sure that the items they are donating are okay to be displayed and will not cause distress to other patrons. So yes I believe that offensive materials should be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be in charge of what he or she wants to display. And last stuff like that should not even be in a public area where it can disturb the peace and comfort of the community.
100	3077	2	3	It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with
101	3078	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc..., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Most of the people made books that are inappropriate or offensive and sometimes are the life of the person or some experience that they have lived. But the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't think that this is the life of a person and can be the future of more people. People sometimes like to be the best and can make problems with others and that makes them happy, which is a sad thing because that's bad and also they can get to the point of doing things so bad that they go to jail; those are some of the experiences that people show but others get it wrong. Well, that's their problem, they can do whatever they want. I know that life is not easy but thanks to that material we can have a better life and also we can defend ourselves. Also, I don't think that they need to remove those books or magazines because that's what helps us to have a better life, also in the future; they need to be there and if people find them offensive, just don't go there or don't see those materials, ignore them. More people like those and think that they are helpful for them and for me. I don't think that they are going to have bad material in there; things that are inappropriate, I think that they can't have bad or nasty information in a place that a lot of people go to, and not only adults, children go too. And that is more inappropriate for kids. People know what's going on in there and some other persons know too. The world sometimes is a danger and sometimes helps us to grow up; that is a good thing but we have the choice if we want to read or have that information. I remember one time when I read a book that is kind of sad but that helped me to know our life better; it was about two boys, the book has a lot of bad words and talks really bad, but also that explains the book more and we learn more about it. That's some of the things that help us with life. One of the books, magazines, music, movies, etc. that we can write is our life because we pass a lot of difficult times and that is a book of our life and can be an inappropriate book of our life. People like me give thanks to those people that publish their experiences and at the same time help us to understand our own journeys.
102	3079	2	3	I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be allowed to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask ourselves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just downright boring? Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We must have the right to take down the books but why should we? It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff that our children should know about, such as slavery, and famous people, and the important events that shaped our history. What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other than the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropriate off the shelves of the library, there wouldn't be anymore books left. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books, which would leave almost nothing for older readers. Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell you who wants to do that. Nobody, it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you might like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't explore those different worlds and ideas. We don't need to take any books out of the libraries. There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones left. We are just taking away something that is really big to us as a society, and without those books there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do, so why take them away and limit our understanding of the world?
103	3080	2	3	I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic. I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of most of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen. Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as inappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book might talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed from the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer. Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief and feel less alone. All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose and reach the readers who need them most.
104	3081	2	3	What do you want your child being exposed to? In my own opinion I believe that certain materials shouldn't be taken off the shelves, because kids know what books are appropriate and inappropriate for them. This is why the library has a 'kids' selection away from the 'adult' selection. They know their boundaries, and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything inappropriate. The library is a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out. Also, it's not just libraries, these materials can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, t.v. and video games. Any where you go they're more likely going to see inappropriate actions that take place. So as a parent it is your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible. The only way a child can be exposed to this is if their parents are unattended and irresponsible. Someday your kids will ask questions about that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students. Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter. I know a lot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games, music about drugs, alcohol, and sex. This really bothers me, because when I was their age I had no idea what that even was or meant. It's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know it has a label on it saying 'Parental Advisory', 'Explicit' or 'Mature'. Every time I hear a child say something about this awesome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence and etc, the children tend to get younger and younger every time. I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unnecessary stuff when they have the power to guide them towards better choices.
105	3082	2	3	NEWSPAPER. Readers, today I'm going to tell you what I think on offensive materials in libraries. Offensive materials such as books, magazines, music, movies are found in libraries and to some people they are offensive. But to others they can think its perfectly ok to have in a public place. Thinking something's offensive is just an opinion and every person has a different look on things. The first thing I have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away. Some people can find these items very educational and they might be able to relate to that book that other people would say is offensive. And if offensive materials are really bothering some people and the libraries are getting a lot of complaints they should just make a section in the library just for the offensive books, movies, etc. So people won't have to look at those offensive materials if they choose not to. Another thing is that libraries are a public place and they should have a wide range of books, movies, etc. Because not every one likes the same thing. People have different interests and outlooks on different things. So people should just accept the things that they might not be into because other people might be really into that. And don't always just think about yourself, look at the big picture and consider the community's diverse needs. So there are some of my thoughts and feelings on what I think about offensive materials in libraries. And I hope that you can see my point that I'm trying to get across about the importance of access and choice for all.
106	3083	2	3	Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see? No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see. The primary responsibility lies with the library staff, who should not allow younger children into the area containing uncensored books, magazines, movies, and music unless their parent or guardian is with them. It is the fault of the media staff if they permit unsupervised access to these sections. The kids should have a certain part of the library where they can take books from that is appropriate for them, while the adult-oriented materials are kept separate. There are a lot of books that children shouldn't be able to read, but they read them anyway without adult permission. While some books are suitable for both little ones and big kids, it is offensive to parents when the staff allows children to read and see inappropriate content, leaving parents to wonder how their children are learning such things. Certain things should be clearly posted and restricted from children's access. I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read or see things they are not supposed to see; the staff knows these things are not appropriate, so why allow it? In conclusion, yes, I think certain things that are not supposed to be accessible are mistakenly placed where young children can see them. That is not right, which is why I am writing this essay to the newspaper to argue against allowing children to see uncensored materials they are not meant to see.
107	3084	2	3	Do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive? From my point of view yes, because libraries are public spaces which means they are open to any and everyone. Kids could see a photo that may not be appropriate for them, people of different religions could hear foul language, and it could give some libraries a bad image. I can relate to this because I have also heard some things that I am not proud of, such as foul language. That affected me because when I heard it, I went around saying it to people who were positive influences in my life. Of course, this could affect a child in a negative way. Kids grow up to be as positive as they can, at least that's what parents teach them, and if they get hooked on things they see, they will try to imitate it. From my experience, it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline. But if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects, they will learn the hard way. This is a reason I wish censorship was in our local libraries. Also, people of different religions could find it offensive. We have different consumers that walk in and out of the library every day, so when they enter they should find it peaceful, not the opposite. For example, a Muslim could walk in the library and hear others listening to music with nothing but profanity. Now that person has the right to report the person who was listening to it and can say the library has no restrictions. At times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words, but the library needs to know their limits. Then, the library develops a bad image which is a big problem. When something gets a bad look, sooner or later it will not be there anymore, meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another. For example, when you leave the library, the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library. But if problems constantly happen there, they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library. Then those figures add up and finally you are struck out and the library is gone. Now, if they are not removed this is what can happen: children will imitate what they see or hear, and complaints will be filed against that library. If I had a problem with the restriction levels at the library, I would just stop going. And if that library cannot help it, at least have the courtesy to mark the sections of the library clearly. This will make sure we know what we are about to see and read before we encounter it.
108	3085	2	3	I believe that certain things such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf. The reason I think that they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them; different individuals have varied tastes and needs for information. If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library, as they have the choice to visit another one. I personally don't get offended by anything. When I am going through the library, I have seen people get offended by some of the things that they have on the shelves. Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing; what one person finds acceptable, another may not. People that read things and get offended by it should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not, as their concerns are valid for their own experience. The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriate, containing content that is not suitable for all audiences. It might not be good for the eyes of people, particularly younger patrons who could be exposed to mature themes. I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them, establishing a consistent standard. So that way no one is making a big deal about what is on the shelves, creating a fair and uniform system for everyone.
109	3086	2	3	Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be looking at or saying those things, as it can negatively influence their development and behavior. Some of the books could offend some people when they don't know it, creating an uncomfortable environment for patrons who are seeking a peaceful place to read and learn. Parents need to watch what their kids read and watch on a daily basis, taking an active role in their children's education and entertainment choices. Kids need to know why they shouldn't watch those shows or read those books, understanding the reasons behind the restrictions. Maybe if parents would watch their kids more closely, the children would mind better than what they do now, leading to more responsible behavior. Some of the books could offend people when they don't know it, which is unfair to those who visit the library expecting a respectful atmosphere. No little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies, as the content is too mature and potentially harmful for their age. That is why I think those books should be taken out of all libraries, to protect children and maintain a comfortable space for all community members.
110	3087	2	3	As we all know, all kinds of information can be found in a local, book storage facility, commonly referred to as a library. All kinds of knowledge is in this little area, but is some of that information inappropriate enough to be in a public place? Many libraries may possess on their shelves books and magazines and even music containing explicit material, and how could you avoid it in such an open environment? In a modern world, there's going to be language and personal attributes that would be found offensive to older people and viewers of public broadcasting who expect a certain standard. Yes, I agree some material can and should be in separate areas from mainstream material, allowing for choice while providing clear boundaries. But on a whole, who cares? I mean, most ordinary people don't pay much attention to it, focusing instead on the materials they personally seek out. I know I don't get overly concerned with the content available to others. Censorship is stupid, because most of the stuff in libraries, if you haven't heard of it yet, you will soon encounter it in other aspects of daily life, no matter what censorship steps are taken by library officials to restrict access.
111	3088	2	3	I believe libraries should have all types of books, music, movies, and magazines. I believe if libraries had limited things that a lot of people would not come to the library, as the variety is a primary draw. For example, if I wanted to get a certain book for school and the library does not have it, I don't know where else I would go, especially if I cannot afford to buy it. The library should have a wide variety of books; if not, what is the point of a library? Some books might be too explicit for a child to read, which is a valid concern for parents. For music, I think a library should be limited in its selection. I think music should be limited because a lot of music has cursing in it, and I don't think everyone wants to hear that type of music in a library. I don't think a person should be able to listen to music in the library anyways because a library is supposed to be a quiet place for study and reading. But also, people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed by the limited offerings. Some music might be too bad for some children's ears, which is another reason for caution. For movies, I think they should have an age limit for children. That's simple; kids should be able to only watch kid-friendly movies. Teenagers should be allowed to watch kid movies and teen movies, which are more suitable for their age group. Adults should be able to watch all movies, including those with mature content. That is how it should go, with clear categories for each age. For magazines, they should have all types of magazines available. They should have them from child to adult but placed in different sections for organization. For example, all the children's magazines should go with the children's books, creating a dedicated area for younger readers. All the adult magazines should be with the adult reading books, ensuring they are separated. Some magazines are too explicit, but the library should make sure these magazines stay strictly in the adult section to prevent accidental exposure. Some books are offensive, but they are books and a library is there to provide books of all kinds. All kinds of books should be in the library no matter what, in my opinion, as limiting them goes against the principle of free access to information. I've never experienced a nasty, or explicit book myself, but I understand the concern. So if anything is explicit, the best solution is to keep it in the adults-only section, allowing access while providing a safeguard. Every book should be available in the library to serve the entire community's diverse needs and interests.
112	3089	2	3	We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen television shows and movies that are the same way, with scenes cut or dialogue altered. Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with asterisks, which can disrupt the reading flow. Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, believing it protects younger audiences, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway, making the effort pointless. If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it, with your artistic vision intact? Most of those people would, and they get angry when their work is edited without their consent. They want their work to be heard as intended, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things causes the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words, which were chosen for a specific impact. This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different than what it was originally supposed to mean, thus betraying the creator's intent. However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music that they are not mature enough to process? Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand, prioritizing their innocence. Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things in the real world, where censorship does not exist. In conclusion, censorship should just be ignored as an ineffective solution. Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines as they grow older. Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians who feel their expression is being violated. There are loads of harsh things in the world; it's impossible to just edit them all out, so it is better to focus on guidance rather than removal.
113	3090	2	3	They were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf. But if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - that work I abhor, then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf based on their own personal dislikes. But then, they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read, as everyone would remove something another person valued. They think that they should get some books that are not found offensive by anyone, which is an impossible standard to meet. This is what they should do about books that are found offensive: instead of removal, they should be placed in a separate section. If kids were reading books that the author found offensive, they should get rid of them from the children's area, but not from the library entirely. The books that were found offensive should not be read by those they offend, but they can be available for others. Books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read if you are not prepared for their content. Offensive books should not be anywhere you are at if you choose to avoid them, but they should remain accessible. If you are going to read a book, do not get a book that is offensive to your sensibilities; select one that suits you. Non-offensive books like encyclopedias, those kinds of books are not very offensive and are generally safe for all audiences. If books were not offensive, people would read them very often without any hesitation or concern. If people were to read books very often, there would not be enough time to do anything else, as reading can be quite absorbing. We do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them forced upon us, but we also do not deserve to have them removed entirely. People deserve to have better and not offensive books available, but also the freedom to choose. Every day we read books, but do we know if they are offensive until we start reading them? If we did not know about the books we are reading were offensive, then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying, potentially causing social issues. If we say stuff right out of the offensive book, we would get in severe trouble with authority figures or peers. Getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment, which is a consequence to consider. When you get punished, it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of time, like a privilege or possession. In conclusion, you understand what you can and cannot read based on your own judgment and values. You also understand about what to do with offensive books, which is to avoid them rather than ban them. That non-offensive books can make you learn something valuable without any risk. You can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books, leading to negative outcomes. And that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of time if you are not careful with your choices.
114	3091	2	3	The way that the books, music, etc. are made is for people basically of that specific age group, with content tailored to their understanding. Like if that particular book contains profanity that some find offensive, then they should ignore that book and move on to the other book that is more fitting for that person rather than starting a controversy over that just one book, which seems disproportionate. Some stuff will have labels on them like parental guidance to show that only a particular age person can have access, providing a clear warning for consumers. From my experience is that it's ok to encounter such material, but if it gets out of hand or makes me uncomfortable, then I just leave it and go to the next thing that is more suitable. Although removing the books from most people might not help a lot because some people would like to have that book that they won't find anywhere else, and it could be important for their research or enjoyment. The librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library, where it is more appropriate, and have the kids' books in the younger section of the library, thus organizing by maturity level. So hopefully this might help the problem that you might have and allow people to enjoy those books, music, magazines, etc. without conflict, by providing choice and clear organization.
115	3092	2	3	Do you think there should be any books, movies, magazines, etc. taken off the shelves? Well, if so then you should read my newspaper article for my perspective. I don't think that there is any books, etc., that I would take off the shelves personally, as I believe in access to all materials. There are many books, etc., that kids should read for education, but you can tell your kids not to read them, or if they do start to read them, you can take the book away from them as a parental action. There are some books that kids shouldn't read due to mature content, but only you, as a parent, can stop them from reading them through supervision and guidance. They will always try to find a way to get what they want, because curiosity is a powerful force. So taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good in the long run, because they'll find the book, movie, etc., somehow, perhaps through friends or the internet. The only way to make sure is to keep your kids under watch, and to make sure they don't do the stuff you don't want them to do, which requires active involvement. In conclusion, taking books off the shelf wouldn't help anyone out, as it restricts access for everyone, but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you don't want them to be around through communication and monitoring.
116	3093	2	3	If I owned or worked at a library, I would have books, music, movies, and magazines that to many people are offensive. But I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the children's area of the library. I would have them in the adult area. Why would I keep that type of books, music, or movies, might you ask? Well, because adults and older teenagers should be able to handle and act like adults when reading the book, watching the movie, or listening to the music. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town, then I will completely remove the item from the shelf. It is that simple. If parents get mad and angry because of these books, movies, and music, then don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them. Pick out a child's book or watch a child's show, don't pick out material meant for adults. Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color. My question is, why not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive? Many people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music. People live in different worlds even though we all live in one. In my opinion, offensive books, music, and movies should stay in libraries. Just little and younger kids should not read, watch, or listen to them, and that is a reasonable way to manage the collection.
117	3094	2	3	Books, music, movies, and much more being removed off of the shelf because no one liked them and find some of them offensive does not mean we should get rid of them. Many enjoy them, and could use them for school research or topics for a class. First of all, I know for a fact that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother many other people; it was clearly our choice to buy the music, book, or movie. We all have different opinions on what 'good' music or movies are. I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of it because of the foul language or racial slurs, but it is our money and our decision to buy it. Many teens take the music thing out of control and turn it up so loud that it will let the whole neighborhood hear it, and with all the words and comments they make in the music, I can see why adults don't want us to buy it. In respect for others, I think we can turn down the radio, not make comments during movies, and don't be immature with the books. Second, with all the research and studying we have to do in school, it would be pointless to not be able to have books or magazines to do our research with. Nowadays, the students get to pick what they want to do a topic over, and if they want to do that topic badly enough, then I am pretty sure they should have the material to look up the information on that subject. I do realize that it gets out of control with the music, movies, magazines, and books, but we know when to settle down and grow up. Teens who are going to be immature about it do not deserve to have all those things. We just have to learn to use it with respect. Just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school, believe it or not, and that is an important point to remember.
118	3095	2	3	Yes, offensive materials should be removed because what if a young child could find a book that talks about his race in a bad way? Now if a man walks in and finds an offensive book about his race, he might take the situation to a new level; maybe he might demand it to be taken off the shelf or something else. If a woman walks in with her son or daughter and finds a dirty, nasty book about sex, drugs, guns, and knives, that is a problem. So yes, an offensive book should be taken off a shelf if the book or books are in a public library. The only reason the books should be taken off the shelf is because if it's a public library, a lot of kids and their parents go there to read, do research, and do homework. It is a shared space for the community. And that is why a public library should take an offensive book off their shelf to maintain a safe and appropriate environment for all its visitors, especially the children.
119	3096	2	3	I believe that they need to keep everything and gain more. There is so much to learn about. The more information you have, the better. I, for one, think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information and perspectives. Though you cannot trust everything in one source, you can still find many facts about what you're wanting to learn about by comparing different materials. On the other hand, children should not be able to reach or see some of this content. It could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about, which is a valid concern for parents. The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids won't get into it and we can still learn and find out new things safely. Not everything should be hidden from adults who can process it. The more you know could just save the world, or at the very least, help you understand it better, which is the ultimate value of a well-stocked library.
120	3097	2	3	I would like it if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. Why should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are a lot of parents that don't follow the censorship rules, like buying a rated mature movie or game for their kid that is ten, and not eighteen years old, but does it matter that the parents are following the law? I say screw the law, because when it comes down to it, it's the parents' right to tell or show their kid about things, not the government. I think that young people have never really had a choice in matters that affect them directly, and I think we should. Young people have to follow whatever rules until they are eighteen years of age: why? I wish I knew why, but I don't, because there is no logical reason for us not to have a vote on what affects us. For all I know, there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerful than the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that it's possible for something like this to happen. Video games are my weakness, I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like kids who play video games with violence will become murderers, it makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that. I have known people who have been censored all their life, and when they learn about the real world they can't even handle it. It's sad really to not be able to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world just because they have been kept away from all that all their life. I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them something was bad and to never watch or read it? Where did they hear these ideas from? I believe it came from the media itself. I can see the headlines now claiming that watching a certain movie causes kids to be murderers, complete with a made-up percentage. What I am really saying is that I try not to let other people's beliefs get in my head and change my own beliefs. Even by me writing this, I may have caused someone to change their beliefs, and I really hope I haven't, because everyone should be free to make their own choices.
121	3098	2	3	Do I believe that some books, movies, magazines, or etc., should be removed due to the fact some people might find them offensive? NO, I believe that everyone should have the chance to see it, not just the people who did and thought it was offensive. Someone could really like it or a group of people could. Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work. Let's say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries because people find it offensive. Then a local school has a project on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now due to somebody else's dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do their research. It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive. The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from, and removing materials based on individual sensitivities sets a problematic precedent. So no I don't believe that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or etc., due to the fact that some other people find them offensive, as access to diverse information is a fundamental principle of such institutions.
122	3099	2	3	Twilight, Harry Potter, or even The Magic Tree House series are books that many guardians do not allow their children to read due to their beliefs on what is real and what is not. Magic, spells, and vampires many of us know are not real but others do not believe in what it is that is being taught to the younger readers. My personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. But there would be certain circumstances where I would have to put my foot down and censor things such as sex and drugs just because that is not suitable for young children to be reading at that young of an age. The reason why I would have a low tolerance of the censorship is because different people like different things. If someone was an athlete they might not find a book about cooking and cleaning very appealing. As if a person that was a cook might not find a book about athletics too appealing either. Just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my stand point on the censorship of certain articles. Different beliefs of certain people is understandable but, just because you don't believe it doesn't mean that everyone else is going to right there not believing it with you. Don't ruin it for the others who enjoy the interesting fact of a male wizard falling in love with a normal muggle girl just like you and me. Another reason why my censorship in libraries is low is because it would give my library more variety. If there was twenty different Harry Potter books on the shelves many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please. Also, if you didn't know what kind of book you wanted to check out, you could look around and get a mystery, drama, comical, or even a horror book. Having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more. I know that when my library had a series of books that I found interesting that I was back in there after I finished each one. Also, having different reading or viewing materials on hand is important in a library due to the fact that some books these days are now turned into films which makes people more eager to finish that book in less then a week so that weekend they can watch the movie. Most people say that the movies are never better then the original book itself but an opinion is easier to be based off of reading the book and then watching the movie not just by stopping after reading the book. Now that you know my personal views about the censorship in libraries understand that not everyone is the same. That is why when school's talk about getting school uniforms many children are against it due to the fact of wearing whatever style of clothing you do each day show individuality such as which type of book your reading also, shows your individuality. That is why my personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to the fact that different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. Just because you may not believe in the magic or wizardry doesn't mean you have to ruin it for someone else. So don't judge a book by it's cover and lets not set a high standard on censorship in libraries, for a library's strength lies in its diversity of thought and content.
123	3100	2	3	I strongly disagree. I think that materials should not be removed from the library. Because all the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too. All the materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, cd's, should not be removed from the library. I got my own reasons that materials should not be remove from the shelf. Like sometimes I don't found any interesting things to do, so I go to my tiny library that I got in my house and I pick any book that I like. But when I don't like or I don't find any interesting book in my house, I go to the library to find some interesting books. But when the libraries or the school got offensive books, magazines, movies, etc., I think that offensive stuff should not be remove from the library, because it is not necessarily good for the children's, like when they want to read a book, like cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want they are going to get mad. And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will, and they maybe are not going to came back again. I never experience something like this in my life because in my school and the library that I go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated. that's why I respect the people for the library and for the school, because they respect us too. that's why I never go to places that I don't know. Suppose I go to a library that I don't know and I bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if I don't have respect, and that I bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that I bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right. And those are my opinions why materials should remain available for everyone who needs them.
124	3101	2	3	No, I do not think that books, magazines, movies and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magazines, movies, and music should be monitored by age. The reason why is because younger children should not be reading, listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers. The way these type of things can be monitored is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magazine, movie, and music that the child wants a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librarian knows that the parent is of age. Teenagers should also be monitored. Even though they are almost adults, some parents may not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards to indicate these restrictions to the library staff. Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a persons child is reading, watching, or listening to I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading, watching or listening to, and this system of age-appropriate access is a more balanced solution than outright removal of materials from the library's collection.
125	3102	2	3	Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song. I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as 'Cosmopolitan' do not reach their shelves. Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consequences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think? In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment for all families and patrons.
126	3103	2	3	I feel as we are letting kids these days do as they feel, and do whatever they want without sufficient guidance. We are making them think that we don't care what they are involved in, but that's not true at all. We need to set clear boundaries for what kids should and shouldn't be able to do, establishing firm limits. We need to show them that we know what they are doing and that we are paying attention. I think that there should be a strict age policy for public libraries. If there are any books that have any types of adult content, such as explicit scenes or strong language, they should be exclusively in the adult section. If you ever wanted to check out books, movies, or magazines from that section you would have to be eighteen or older, providing valid identification. If that was too much to ask for, then you should at least have the parents sign a consent form acknowledging the material. Books, movies, and magazines with any type of adult content can be hazardous to a child, whether it's through their future actions or their developing behaviors. It can negatively effect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things, potentially causing confusion. We need to show them that we care about their well-being. I know from personal experiences that being exposed to this type of material drastically changes people, not over a long time but quickly and profoundly. Nowadays the media is portraying that money, alcohol, fame, and drugs are good things to be sought after. This is the very message we are putting into our movies and books and magazines, and putting into the children of today's heads, influencing their worldview. We are telling them that its ok to pursue these things, but its most certainly not acceptable behavior. These are all the reasons why we should put censorships and restrictions on libraries to protect the young. We are letting the children of this generation grow up too fast and introducing them to adult concepts way too early in their lives. In a way, we are brain washing them on how to live a destructive life, through adult oriented things that they cannot yet process, and this must be stopped for their own good.
127	3104	2	3	The media is destroying our youth! This is something we hear everyday from various sources. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how much different their world used to be, reminiscing about a simpler time. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence, keeping such matters private. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright or without consequence. Because of these people and their constant reminders, we are led to think that the media is responsible for the wrong in the world of today. The truth is that it isn't the media's fault entirely; it is primarily the parents' responsibility. It is the parents' fundamental job to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong, guiding their moral compass. If these such parents do their jobs correctly then the youth of today will not need for everything to be censored for their protection. It is my firm belief that there should not be any censorships imposed by external bodies. When there is censorship, people in power can govern what we learn, destroy what goes against their personal beliefs, and ultimately destroy our god given right to freedom of speech and expression. Censorship will destroy the knowledge available to society. We have seen censorship in our own history, and the results are alarming. When we look back we see that the ruling powers censored and destroyed anything that went against them, silencing opposition. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the customs, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people, erasing culture. How would we be any different if we did it now? We could potentially be destroying someone's entire way of life and their cultural heritage. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrow's masterpiece, a work of great artistic value. In censoring we would be destroying history itself, removing pieces of our past. By destroying history we would be destroying the brilliance that is learning from our collective experiences. If we allow censorship, anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed and removed from public access. If you ask any Christian if they would allow their children to read the Muslim book of faith, the Quran, they would likely tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a Muslim if they would let their children read the Bible. The point is that if there is censorship we would be destroying other people's sacred beliefs and faiths. No one has the right to govern what others believe in this world; such control is oppressive. Also, with censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the fundamental freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow people to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas and form their own opinions because everyone has different opinions and theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same approved thing, creating an echo chamber. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would have to say, offering no new insight. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those rights from taking more, leading down a slippery slope. Of course there will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like or find distasteful. There will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn in modern society. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are an unavoidable part of life and human experience. They are the dark parts that we don't want to see or acknowledge. If you don't want to see it, then simply don't look; exercise personal choice. Just don't close everyone else's eyes because you don't like what you see, imposing your views on others. Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to the dangers of censorship. We cannot allow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us to read and think. Our media is too intertwined with our daily lives to be controlled so heavily. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our own lives and minds? If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop there; they will just keep taking what freedoms we have left until we are nothing more than a dictatorship, stripped of our liberties.
128	3105	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be such a big deal or a point of major conflict. There are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people, which is inevitable given diverse tastes. To solve the problem, everything should not be censored or removed from the shelves. Why can't those that find it offensive just steer clear of it and choose something else to read? I believe it should be a person's own individual choice to read something or not, and if they find it offensive, they should simply put it down and walk away from it. The book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has offended many people due to its language and themes. I have read it myself and was not offended by its content. I found it very interesting and highly educational, providing valuable lessons. Many people think the book should be censored or banned entirely from schools. But if it is censored, the story would completely change and it would not be the same powerful narrative, losing its impact. I would have learned nothing from a sanitized version instead of learning how people lived and struggled through a difficult period in history. If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were taken off the shelves, and all the books offensive to another person were taken away, what would be left for us to read? Only little kids books about kittens and puppies? Well that's just lovely for children, but not for mature readers seeking knowledge. I am very much against censorship in any form within our libraries. I believe that if a material is offensive to you personally, then you shouldn't read it or listen to it; that is your right. But don't ruin it for the rest of us who may find value in it or wish to make our own informed decisions about the content we consume.
129	3106	2	3	The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information. Including children's books, novels for young adults, reference materials, biographies, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before, expanding our horizons. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well, which some find troubling. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else entirely. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this in a public space. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries to create a safer environment. I would like to begin by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race in a derogatory manner. Imagine if an African American woman brought her young daughter of eight years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of a historical figure, she found a book making fun of African Americans and calling them inappropriate, hurtful names. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs that cause pain. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally, affecting their self-perception. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately to prevent such harm. Another issue I have is with explicit sexual content being found in libraries intended for the general public. I do understand that several classic books contain some sort of sexual content as part of their narrative, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind for personal reasons, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure there. That type of book, however, should not be found in the public library where children frequent. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge with gratuitous material. Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries that serve a diverse community. Every human in the country is entitled to their own choice of religion without fear of ridicule. They should be able to practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries around the world. If we have an uncommon right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions, creating division? A Jewish woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is a waste and stupid, causing offense. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries, which should promote understanding. Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship to avoid overreach. Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty of meaningful content. Yes, if we do not censor within certain, clearly defined limits, this could indeed happen, which is a valid concern. This is not what I want to happen though, as I value access to information. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain without context. The least we can do, as responsible parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries to protect our youth from premature exposure to harmful ideas.
130	3107	2	3	Two of the many privileges that we have as Americans are freedom of speech and freedom of expression, which are foundational rights. Although some bodies of work may be perceived as offensive or inappropriate by certain individuals, I believe that they should still be available to the public who wish to access them. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others may not; but they should not be removed from libraries simply because of their negativity or challenging nature. These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate in a given context, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned outright. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others may or may not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs and to express them. Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive by modern standards, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior in the past so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living, learning from past mistakes. I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ignorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe, leading to a lack of understanding. All of these books are educational in their own way, though some are harsh and difficult to read, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong in society. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children, could start to think that a certain idea, that may be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable because they lack historical context. As someone once said, 'Those who do not know their history are bound to repeat it', making these works crucial for education. By removing the problem of offensive content, we would be creating another issue of historical ignorance. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnic
131	3108	2	3	Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves? In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material. A library's strength lies in its diversity of thought and content, not in its limitations. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible.
132	3109	2	3	Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' and I agree. I feel that some of the books we have in our public libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give students and young children the wrong impact on life or their environment around them. Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. My observation when I look at kids in my community playing is that they follow one another. When they're playing tag and hide and go seek, they mimic behaviors they see. So movies, books, music, and magazines play a big part on the way they behave. My own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by certain authors. In these books they use cruel language, use women body parts as symbols and many more rude things. My little sister came across one of these books, when she asked me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, so the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book. For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shouldn't have. Another experience I've saw was with my little cousin. He was looking at a magazine out of the public library. The magazine was offensive to women. It was a play boy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazines, but I think it is very wrong that they use women's bodies for men to view. I also feel that those type of magazines should not be in a public library. I believe it gives children, mainly young men the wrong thoughts about women. My overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not everyone is going to feel the same way I do. There are parents that allow their children to read, listen, and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say I don't feel that is the way to go about things, because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things. I hope you take with you, my personal experience with you and help you children read, listen, and watch age appropriate books, music, movies, and magazines.
133	3110	2	3	Do I think that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries? No, because people might need to know certain information, certain lessons are taught in different sources, and all sources are liabilities. Now, you just might need certain information, and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn. For example if I were to go in a library and need a book on religion I would need a book or movie to teach me on that particular subject, or even sex education I would need a magazine or movie to watch to know new information. There are different lessons taught in different aspects. For example some people learn by example, from movies, music, and magazines. If it were me looking for a source on music theory I might need one of those things to get what I need. Finally, those things are liabilities. Don't get me wrong, we need them on a daily basis, but in a sense we sort of do. We use search engines for everything, everyday, but libraries provide curated and reliable sources. So what do you think? In conclusion I believe we need those sources because someone might need certain information, there are different lessons learned and taught in different things, and lastly all sources are liabilities that serve a purpose for someone.
134	3111	2	3	The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not a good thing to do. My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only be empty shelves in libraries across the country. Once the removing of books starts there will be hardly any left. We use books everyday; for students we use them to learn and for entertainment during some classes. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults some of them like to read in their free time for knowledge and relaxation. I think it's wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think it's inappropriate. If it is, the libraries should have a section for those books that don't let the little kids go in that section. There is a problem for this idea: what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to remove or put into a special section in the libraries across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library. Another solution to this matter is that, the libraries across the nation have another labeling system like the Dewey decimal system but use both. This new system could contain information like reviews from critics about the book, or what happened during the book's plot. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to be engrossed in for the next week or so. The books, music, magazines found in libraries should be left there for a reason. Somebody wrote, or composed them for a reason, so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines and listen to good music.
135	3112	2	3	Libraries should never remove any material just because it might be found offensive. Something that is offensive to one person may not be to another. If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place. People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion. But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values. Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person, and no single viewpoint should dictate access for all. So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions. As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored. I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to. But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogatory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things without restriction. In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it. But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them.
136	3113	2	3	I don't believe books should be taken off of the shelves for being offensive. Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another, as individual sensibilities vary greatly. People always have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book. I understand that parents want to protect children, and that is a natural instinct. Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they don't want them reading that specific book, fostering an open dialogue. Parents might also just let their children read it and then explain why they personally don't approve, offering guidance rather than imposing a strict ban. I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve years old I started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played. My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs I would listen to. She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it. Consequently, I went to my friends houses and listened to explicit music and watched rated R movies. She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went, at school or among peers. I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music, the parents should explain why they object and let them make the decision themselves. I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child, not a public institution. Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away by creating forbidden fruit. That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable with each other, building a relationship based on trust and communication rather than control.
137	3114	2	3	Many people go to libraries; such as children, parents, and grandparents. I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet, a refuge from the noise of the world. Some don't even go there for the books at all. They will engage in listening to music, reading a magazine, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet. Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them entirely? These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned. First of all, the libraries will lose customers who come specifically for that content. There is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or heavy metal. It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual inuendo. Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while. Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have head phones on, which isn't disruptive to others in or around the library, preserving the quiet atmosphere. Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them; it is a matter of personal choice. If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it. You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children books you can look through. Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books for their own reasons. I have been to my public library many atimes and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes. So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes a considerable amount of looking, not just a quick little scan through the shelves. Finally, freedom. Isn't that was America is all about? The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch. I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is G, PG, PG-13, or R. It also includes the not-so-nice content that will be present in the movie, providing a clear warning. So you have total freedom to purchase or check out any of those rated movies. Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy with your selection. As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies from library collections. There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone who chooses not to partake. Libraries will lose customers, people dont have to choose the less appropriate things, and us citizens have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch. So save yourself some time and just keep the few so called 'offensive' materials available for those who want them.
138	3115	2	3	There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed from public access. Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work that require them to research various topics. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it effectively. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting their work done properly, hindering education and professional research. Some people find some offensive subjects interesting for academic or personal reasons. For example, if someone found the Holocaust interesting they might want to just do some research to learn more about it and understand its historical significance. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects, limiting their understanding of complex historical events. There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive due to its lyrical content. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad about the loss of their favorite artists. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job, impacting the music industry and artists' livelihoods. I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining about their availability for others. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removing books, magazines, music, etc. from public access. I hope you take into consideration the importance of not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else they are available to the public.
139	3116	2	3	I think that if there are books, music CDs, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff as she grows up. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar, wanting to protect her innocence. I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions on such matters. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we find the movies, books, music and magazines to be offensive or vulgar then they should come off the shelf, as public funds should reflect community standards to some degree. Kids can read or see or listen to these vulgar things and think its ok or cool to say or do these things, leading them to mimic bad behavior. They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence depicted in some of these materials. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them from images and descriptions. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in some books that are readily available. The kids can look at this stuff and see graphic violence portrayed. For example they can see pictures of men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example for their developing minds. We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to on a daily basis. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing and consuming in terms of media. The library is a place where many people go to learn and it should be a safe environment. It is important that only material that is appropriate for a general audience is made readily available in such a public space.
140	3117	2	3	Going into a library everyone has their own opinions as to what they should see on the shelves, and what should be put out on the shelves for everyone to see including children of all ages. Some people might agree that there should only be things that is age appropriate for everyone, while others disagree, believing in broader access. In my opinion when I'm looking at this topic, I think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group, but there should also be a designated kid section for younger readers. If parents are so concerned about what types of books their children might see at a library then they could just put them in the children section to view those age-appropriate materials. There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out for different tastes and maturity levels. When it comes to looking at magazines, movies, and music I still have the same opinion to a certain aspect. There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelves, because its not like people can listen to it by just looking at the CD case; they have to check it out first. But my opinion on the magazines, and movies could vary depending on the content. There is a certain extant for movies, and magazines in terms of what is suitable for a public space. I think they should all be allowed on the shelves, minus any pornography, which is a clear line for me. The reason I think like this is because, kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelves at a library; adult choices should not be limited by what is suitable for children. Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at, and pay attention to them while in the library. But when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library where families gather. There is somewhere to draw the line in any situation and that's where I think it should be drawn at a library, balancing freedom of access with common sense public standards.
141	3118	2	3	Not all libraries are entirely good because some individuals use the library computers to access websites that children might find. Other people need the computers for job applications, and the library staff may be assisting them with getting a library card. This can be problematic in some instances. However, children can learn from the library and do their schoolwork if needed. There is so much they can do that they could potentially be there all week. People from little children to adults can still learn in the @NUM1 century. You can learn about your ancestry or about car crashes or about anything that is going on in the world, like Japan or China. You can do so much from the library or from the books that are there. It is up to the family to get to know more about themselves by using the library and its many resources for personal growth and discovery.
142	3119	2	3	There are more than six billion people in the world, which means there are over six billion different personalities and opinions among all these distinct individuals. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but it is likely that it is something the author feels passionate about, and the author could be offended if their opinion was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world, media that used to only be found on shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It is illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups from being offended by the media. There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type of culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors' best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It is important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world, and to find it all and restrict it would be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically. This is a very two-sided subject. It cannot strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before, and just removing the materials from the shelves will not stop it from being exploited. Libraries are already decreasing severely in their relevance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them, and it is not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other resources, like the internet, again. With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinion and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves for public consumption.
143	3120	2	3	What is offensive to you? Your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you. There are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive. The world would not be any different if we were to pull all of these offensive materials off the shelves. There would not be anything left because everyone has their own opinion about something and everyone has different inferences about what is offensive to them. I believe that offensive material should not be removed from the shelf. Everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off. There is always something wrong with something. @CAPS1 might be the way someone has said something or the way they meant @CAPS1 by. There is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say. Either they take @CAPS1 the wrong way or they just think @CAPS1 is wrong. Everyone has their own opinion about everything. The same applies when someone asks you what is offensive to you. Someone else @MONTH1 say that what you find offensive is nowhere near offensive to them. For instance, my grandpa loves all types of music and his life revolves around music. My grandma does not like some of his music because she says '@CAPS1 doesn't sit right with me,' meaning that she does not believe in some things that the music is trying to persuade people to do. My grandpa really does not pay attention to the lyrics as much as my grandma does because he does not see music in that kind of way. My grandpa likes a lot of music because of its rhythm and beat. They always kind of get into disagreements about music they want to listen to because my grandma finds something in the music that is offensive to her beliefs, but my grandpa does not. @CAPS1 does not affect him as much as her. If you were to go around and ask people what is offensive to them, there would be so many different answers and you could never sum @CAPS1 all down to one answer. With only a couple of people feeling offended by some things, but the majority find @CAPS1 different, that would ruin @CAPS1 for everyone almost. Then that would almost be everything gone because @CAPS1 is always that one person that takes @CAPS1 the wrong way and has to feel offended. So I still believe that offensive materials should not be pulled off shelves and that personal discretion is the best approach.
144	3121	2	3	I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that @MONTH1 offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that @MONTH1 hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controversial topic, such as drugs or alcohol, @MONTH1 make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage. To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is appropriate for and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did. As a newspaper company, you obviously know about our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We, as @CAPS3, have @CAPS2. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of the press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, from personal experience, that when someone tries to take away my @CAPS2 that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that would be repressing their @CAPS2 as @CAPS3. I know that if I were an author and my book were taken off the shelf because someone found it 'inappropriate,' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them. However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully and also allows readers to know what controversial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you to consider my proposal because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public while respecting creative freedoms.
145	3122	2	3	Why @CAPS1 @CAPS2? Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 does not even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS3, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content. Many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, etc. For example, I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a Disney magazine, and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half-naked women on the cover right next to the kids' magazines. To me, this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want their child learning about sex at a young age? Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also selling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip hop and rap is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame because they are only creating what people want and what is selling. Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music. They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to the majority of society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material? In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I do not think @CAPS2 would do any good because people will just find another source to get @CAPS2. Like Katherine said, there would not be any books left if it is all taken off, which illustrates the inherent problem with censorship.
146	3123	2	3	I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful. There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing. The content was unexpectedly graphic and mature. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'. It was an experience that highlighted the potential for unrestricted access.  Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion. What is offensive to some, @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, and these resources can provide crucial information and perspective.  I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it @MONTH1 be useful to some people. A balanced approach is necessary to protect children while allowing access to valuable information. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world, making a one-size-fits-all solution impossible.
147	3124	2	3	Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. I don't think they should. The freedom to choose is a fundamental principle.  I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that desicion. No one is making you watch or read any of that; it is a matter of personal responsibility.  I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them. No one forced the act on me. It was my own curiosity that led me to them.  Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature, which often deals with important themes.  There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare, devoid of diverse thought and expression.  You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves, as this would limit access for those who find value in them.
148	3125	2	3	Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent.Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offencive. No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They shouldn't! Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offencive to someone where takin off the shelf, there would be no more books left, which would defeat the purpose of a library.  People walk into the library and most of the time books are labled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normaly don't go to the section that they don't like. There is no reason to go to the section that they dont like becasue they wont be reading a book from there becasue they dont like it. They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what thye have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their buisness but other parents might want their child to soo what all is out there and develope their child's views on subjects, fostering independent thinking.  Everyone has different views and ideas. If every one was the same the world would be boring and there would be notheing to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always somthing to talk about becasue not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes @MONTH1 not be that a nother child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same.  If everyone took the books or music off the self that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most the time oppisits, like comedy and sad books. Most poeple who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa there fore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best selling books poeple wonder why or how so many sold but thats just how it is. People out there like the book so if one person didnt like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and @MONTH1 have changed their life. Books can be very impactfull in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life.The world goes round becasue of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas. everyone cannot be the same it just would not work.  Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it. People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting. Moreover, if everyone tooks books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left. So if you run into a book or some music you dont like just ignore it, dont read it or listen to it. Things will be much simpler in the long run, preserving the library's role as a hub of diverse knowledge.
149	3126	2	3	Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished; they are already aware of the world's realities.  In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there to filter every experience.  Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless, as it does not change their overall environment.  In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images, making library censorship seem insignificant.  Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world, which is ultimately uncensored.
150	3127	2	3	There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornagraphy I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library. Easy access to such material can be concerning for parents.  A library in a school is a great way to help sudents with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects without the risks of an unfiltered online search.  Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand and can navigate the content. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library, which should focus on learning resources.  In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it, acknowledging their growing maturity. If something offends you, go have a talk with the libraian they woukd probably be happy to take it off the shelf, allowing for a community-influenced but sensible collection policy.
151	3128	2	3	Books can be good things, but are they always good? They teach us things, entertain us, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things. When a book is inappropriate for the reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library. Music is the same way. The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone. Some books may be offensive in religious ways. A person might believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way. Some might say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said every time I walked by it. Books can even be inappropriate for little kids. It might have language in it that the parents don't like. People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the childs parents are like. they could think a word is bad when you think it's fine. Everyone is different. Furthermore, a book could contain images not suitable for children. It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books. Some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music. I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream-o is the devils music. She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that God wouldn't like it. Other peoples parents may feel the same way. Magazines could also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way. Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them. They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it may not be suitable for everyone. Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely.
152	3129	2	3	Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too? Your cousin believing in one thing, means you have to believe in it also? No, not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate. Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere; in stores, in schools, inside, outside, they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about, that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it, well I say we don't. Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked, was of an offence to another, does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion. I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one, it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they might see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong. Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like, that is another person, anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us, so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We may not all agree with their way of life, we may not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another, so why should an item? A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate, but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate, especially in the world we live in today. If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile, and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like, and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives, have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too. So just because I agree with everything I said, are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not, but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we may not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is, because it is what you live in and it is what you have, because with out it nothing would be anything. Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things.
153	3130	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. People live around offensiveness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in Mark Twain's novel To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee using terms that are offensive to African American people to set the tone of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it. People live around offensiveness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they might hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanities in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profane language and behavior when they go to school and work around other children who might have offensive behaviors. Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rent a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson. Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. First of all trying to censor a novel might obscure the message or theme. Secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. Lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research. If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read.
154	3131	2	3	Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down aisles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it? Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things. Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent. Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libraries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.
155	3132	2	3	Brian Jacques 12 October 2021 Public Library 15 Censorship in Libraries Should there be censorship in Libraries? If this is a public high school library no, but if it is a public library, yes. I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines. First I'm going to tell you about the books. I think the books in a public high school should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty. Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say. I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a Stephen King book, all that matter is that they are reading. War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be. Now in a public library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs. I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum. Next I'll talk about the movies they should have available in the library. I don't think anything over PG-13 at a public high school level. Except like sex ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, its got to be PG-13. In public school I it should be G-rated movies. In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films, so theres no reason for there to be anything worse than G-rated. Last I'm going to tell you about magazines. In public high school I don't think the magazines are a big issue. Just as long as theres not pornography and stuff like that. At the public library again I think they should be, kids that age shouldn't be reading Playboy. They just need to have learning and for fun magazines. Should there be censorship in libraries? No at the public high school level and yes at the public library level. Public high school leave the book shouldn't public they should, should in both public movies, and magazines shouldn't in public high school and should in public library.
156	3133	2	3	To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from, making them a cornerstone of knowledge and community. A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax. So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' I believe if things are on the shelf that come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you. If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service and a decline in community patronage. The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony. It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library, dealing with complaints instead of assisting patrons. Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library. An example of some offensive music is the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent. This will come off offensive to many men and women. Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc. People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied and feel comfortable. In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is.
157	3134	2	3	Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library shelves. People might think that some of the material might be offensive of bad for the youth of the people who go to libraries. People might think it would be better to take the bad and offensive item off the shelf. I have a different opion on the subject. I don't think anything should be censored in the library no matter if it deal with book, movies, music, magazines, ect., as limiting access contradicts the purpose of such an institution. The real question is why should this material be censored removed. The answer to that question is that it should not be sensored removed. The library is somewhere you can go to get information on just about anything you want. If these items are censored or taken off the shelfs the resources would be limited and or no help to the people searching for the information. Another big problem with censoring or removint these materials is people might be missing out on alot of knowleged that they have never herd of that might be bad or offensive. Such as slavery, historical events taking over other nations, and a lot of our world history. I feel strongly about people knowing about the worlds past, even the difficult parts. Now what happens if the items are removed from the shelfs of libraries. what are you going to do with the thousands of books that you can no longer read because it is offensive. We just can't get rid of them just like that. A lot of the offensive stuff is true or based on a true story such as Rosa Parks getting arrested because she refused to give up a seat to a white person. so removing these books would be pointless because where ever you put them people will just go there to get the material they want to know about. The most important thing about this is who want these books censored or gone and why they want to remove them. Okay some book are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way. People have there own choice on what they want to read , watch,or listen to. So just because some people dont like the material in a library doesn't mean everyone else doesn't like it. It the peoples choice not a opion on what a couple people say and should not be imposed on all. So at the end i think that books and other items in a library sould not be censored or taken off the shelfs. I believe that people have the right to read, listen, or watch what ever they want. I see it as people opions fighting opions on removing the books. Also if people don't like the book at the library then no one told them thay have to go meaning their opion really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of access to information.
158	3135	2	3	Okay, to me, people are way to moral in the modern world, i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself. Most of everyone know that censorship is a big deal but it doesnt have to be. I know that somethings are a little, risque, but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution. Your probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'? Lets talk about children and this content, if you get this out there quicker and subtlely, the children wont see the need to find out what it is at a later age. If that was to happen the conseqences could be fatal, such as; fines, misdemenors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail. Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general, they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older, so early exposure in a controlled manner can be beneficial. Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community, yea i know what your thinking, why not do that? If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, whos gonna help? The police? who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if your in a city. In that time, some one could have died, been robbed and that same criminal gone. So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be benifical, learning from darker subjects to better handle real-world dangers. Anyways, what im trying to say is, if you take this away from us, people will become weaker, if you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good and become more resilient and prepared individuals.
159	3136	2	3	Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff, believing it is harmful for their development. When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young and repeat it without understanding. Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young and impressionable. Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying, leading to serious consequences. Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language. They also should not be watcing anything about violence. Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying, as these topics are not suitable for their young minds.
160	3137	2	3	Some books in libraries offend others. So should they be removed? That is the point im going to get across today. Keeping people under self-control is top priorities for the public. So why do they keep releasing and publishing books if it offends certain groups? This is a complex issue with many sides. Graphic and gorey books are books usually that disgust people but should all contain a warning symbol on it for people with weak stomachs and those who just can't handle it. So by that means, I'm fine with it. People need to accept that the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and that gruesome stuff is out there. This is my take on the whole situation. So people, if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen and simply choose not to read that material. However offense material to races, religions, and other personal aquisitions, is something of different concerns. This can certainly inflame groups, and even start protest or boycotting it. Authors in some cases need to review their materialand make sure it won't cause any disruption. Inflaming the public is not what you want young authors. This can not only make the public upset, but can possibly lead to the author getting fired from their publishing deals. False statement or inaccurate statements in books can lead to public curiosity and even conspiracy. Not only will it cause a stir up in the press, but just like the race/religion thing, it can cause the author to be fired. This is not what the author wants. So making sure the work is true and not hipotheticle is a good step. These are great steps to achieving a positive step to public influence and maintaining credibility. So inconclusion, authors have lots on their hands. All the way from race issues, religion, fale statements, and so on. These are some of the things authors want to avoid. Making the public recommend the book, and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for in their career.
161	3138	2	3	In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer. There is no appropriate or universally agreed-upon standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should remain undetermined as to what makes a book truly offensive. In a public library, many children, who the books are often censored for, are accompanied by their parents. Parents should therefore make an independent and informed choice on what they can allow their children to read. Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is a ridiculous overreach. If an author spent considerable time and effort creating a story, it should be appreciated for its artistic merit, and should not be put on a list of no-nos. If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation or content, all they have to do is simply not read it. Even in school systems, professional librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it. In my personal experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother had suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. Some parents believe children should be kept ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas and themes are already exploited and presented to them everyday on television and the internet. So trying to shield your child from the bad things might be a great intention, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. The libraries, for some, are the main or only means for getting books. To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. Many of the books banned have important lessons and perspectives that can be obtained through reading it. If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up and read it.
162	3139	2	3	Honestly there's a lot of books and magazines that need to be taken off the shelf. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me what weed was it told me how to grow it! Also a lot of books refer to drugs and sex now a days and I absolutely hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it has been a while since I've checked one out, had enough references to sex that I could honestly say I thought I was reading a porn magazine. Our schools really need to watch what they put onto their shelves. I mean come on sixth graders shouldn't even be able to know what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! Maybe that is why kids get interested in drugs and alcohol at such an early age. The book I read didn't have any negative statements about the weed; it was presented in a neutral way. What makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs? Like I said before a lot of books in schools and public libraries have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you, and where you can buy the crap to make them! Ok I know I'm in high school but you shouldn't have books that seem like porn magazines. The book I read had pictures of positions in it! It broke everything down into explicit details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that my friends is not alright. It is just sad. It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I don't want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alone them reading about it at all. They should just take the books off the schools and public library shelves. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do it's by accident like my encounter was.
163	3140	2	3	I think that removing books from a library that are offensive shouldn't be allowed, first off because people have different taste on the books they read. I also think that the books that the library carries are educational; they might be offensive to some people but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us. Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you don't want your child to read those then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can. So I think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different. One reason why I think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different taste in the books they read. Some people like scary books, some people like romantic novels, so everyone doesn't all like the same thing. Everyone might be offended by something but people shouldn't let it bother them. My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational. They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history, so I don't think that people should really be too offended by the books that other people read. Another reason is that if you don't want your child looking at the books or other materials that might look offensive to you then don't let them read them. Everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like then you're just offending them too. That's why people that enjoy to go to the library shouldn't take things so offensively, so we don't have to censor things at the library. So that's why I think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different taste in the books that they read, the books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books then don't let them read them. People need to understand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are, they are just trying to state their own opinion.
164	3141	2	3	To be perfectly honest it must be said: When I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone. Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesn't matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equally. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good. It doesn't matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same. I believe that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is gay or lesbian they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree when I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't consist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Innocent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present. Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are. In conclusion I believe that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others. Everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care, not hatred.
165	3142	2	3	Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with their parent or guardian. I believe that even though there are some books, magazines, and music not intended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive. Everyone once in their life had to at least experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them. We adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us. If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they can sit and read their favorite books as well with you by their side where you can watch their every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see. Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn their heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they can read and things they can't. Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and might not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit. Go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you and expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library.
166	3143	2	3	To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive, I believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music may be offensive, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. People have all the freedom to read, listen, or watch anything that is appropriate to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to choose what they should do with what may offend others. Also, from my own experience, I have read a book about African Americans in the stages of our history where they were slaves and were hung for their punishment. It may offend some that their local library has a book on such a terrible topic, but it is found that it is part of history and others may find it interesting to go back and learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are racist or trying to offend you; they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them, but the libraries cannot make all happy. If you choose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that may offend someone, then it shouldn't be removed; if you would like to read, watch, or listen to anything that may offend someone, then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it. Therefore, I conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive, they should remain on the shelves. Everyone may have their own opinion or have their own ideals that offend them, but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benefit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide whether or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsible and have to remove anything open to the people that may just be part of our background.
167	3144	2	3	Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isn't usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used. Not everyone has the same views and morals; what may be considered appropriate for some people may be viewed differently by other cultures or religions. In my personal opinion, if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it, etc. Obviously, if the content was published in the first place, it appeals to some audience. No one is forcing people to read or watch things; that is why there is something called viewer discretion. If everything that was considered offensive to a certain individual or group were censored, there would be no free expression. In our society, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is contradictory to that amendment. For example, the censorship of using the word 'God' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesn't apply to my beliefs. Although the program 'The Secret Life Of The American Teenager' portrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs, even though I find this offensive and stereotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it. I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for one's children to be subjected to it, that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive, just keep yourself and your children away from it, which is a more reasonable approach.
168	3145	2	3	Censorship in libraries is not necessary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the guardian of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive, then the guardian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials, some kids might refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get into. Censoring books at a library is pointless; you take away options and the experience to learn from certain books. Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries, you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of, in a way, trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves is another learning experience taken away. If there is a book that a child's guardian disapproves of, keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they want, unless a guardian forbids it. It is not up to libraries whether a book is offensive or bad. That is solely based on the reader's opinion, and everyone's opinion is different. So again, if a guardian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material, they can forbid their child by themselves. When libraries begin to censor books, they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids might just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a different kind of book; leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories might seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea because more kids might actually read. All in all, libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a different story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books help teach a moral or get a point across. Also, some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion, censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the guardian of a child.
169	3146	2	3	Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion, no, I don't think that any books should be banned from a public library. The authors of books have freedom of speech, so yeah, some books may offend people, but if it offends them, they should try to stay away from that book or magazine. I think that if certain books get banned from the library, then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will ban them as well. In my personal opinion, no, I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library. The reason being is because you can't judge a book by its cover. You don't know if the book is going to offend you until you read it. After you read it or you're in the middle of reading it and it offends you, you should take it back to the library and get a new one. Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion, no, I don't think that books should be banned from the public library because a lot of books that do offend people are the ones that teach us about history, and we should not hide from our past.
170	3147	2	3	In my opinion, I think that some books probably should be removed from the shelves if some of the books are found offensive. Some of the movies and books people find offensive can be pretty bad and say nasty things and stuff like that. Some music can be pretty offensive too because it can say nasty things and things like that, but not all music is bad. It depends on the kind of music you like to listen to if it says nasty things because there is many different types of music to listen to. Ultimately, the decision to engage with such material should be a personal choice, and what is offensive to one person might not be to another.
171	3148	2	3	I believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our First Amendment, which is freedom of speech; we should be able to put anything in books, magazines, music, movies, and etc. This fundamental right protects the expression of diverse ideas and opinions. The other reason why we shouldn't take them off the shelf is because we should be able to tell if the book is good enough for your age or your viewings, which depends on your own personal point of view. Individuals and parents can make these choices for themselves. My first reason is the First Amendment, which is freedom of speech. The reason why I say that is because we should be able to put whatever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way, shape, or form. This liberty is essential for a vibrant and open society. Also, if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books, it will go farther than that, and it will come to a point where the First Amendment will effectively cease to exist, eroded by a gradual removal of liberties. In my culmination, I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the First Amendment. I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is because it's another way to express yourself or your point of views, a vital outlet for personal and artistic freedom.
172	3149	2	3	You know when you find a book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not words that are appropriate for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind to see. Or a movie or music that you hear and the content from them shocks you and makes you wish that they would bleep those words. I see it as better to have offensive items such as books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them; stuff like this will make the child think that's how you're supposed to act and talk. Here are two examples of why they should be removed from the shelves: music and magazines. First, in dealing with music, children will imitate acts they see and the words they say. One good example is rap music: their songs have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this, that I have to constantly listen to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and makes me think why are their parents letting their children do this. This influence can lead to negative behaviors being normalized. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines. Second, with magazines, some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are meant to be seen where children do not read. An example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from a magazine; I found a magazine on the table and it showed three of the cast members in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school; they should not have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud? What do they think; it won't bother any kids' parent about it? I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had something like that at their school. In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them and are protected from such harmful influences.
173	3150	2	3	Freedom of the press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of the press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their important messages would be unknown. To censor the right to write freely about one's outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and, in some cases, statistics and events that relate to the past, effectively silencing history. Before today's technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to receive one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information; they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone, replaced by a sterile and limited selection. In the brilliant novel, a man who lives in a dystopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediately taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and destruction as in the novel, showing us a dangerous path to avoid. Having the right to know about your country's history or what is going on in your current government is critical in schools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are too single-minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf permanently, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good, leaving a vast intellectual void. Books are a history in themselves; no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavery or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply choose a more fictional novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exaggerate certain events and without the actual book or site it came from, one could completely alter the public's view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it, engaging in discourse rather than suppression. Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off one's talent is a privilege. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrelevant, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always stretch the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades, inspiring future generations.
174	3151	2	3	The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material, but this practice is ultimately limiting. Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life and their journey of discovery. Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people, making their removal an insult to that effort. The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be found helpful to others, offering perspectives and solutions they might not find elsewhere. Reading material can help a young person with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he or she is reading could help them in the thinking process on what they should do, providing guidance and comfort. The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive? This disregards the value for the many. One of the many times I went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it. I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read; it felt like a personal loss. Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too much self-centered. They care about themself and that is it, without considering the broader community. The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining and valuable. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not from the shelves for everyone. Freedom of the press states that anybody has the right to write whatever he or she wants to write, a cornerstone of our democracy. If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point to where there are no books on any shelf, and our shared cultural space will be empty.
175	3152	2	3	I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelf due to something offensive. Libraries are a very important aspect to life for most people nowadays. Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby. For me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home. The library has the internet and older books with information on the city, serving as a crucial community hub. Living in the society that we have now, not every household can afford a computer with internet. I myself am living in one of those households. The library is a great quiet place to get your work done. It also provides the internet that people can't afford and need for everyday life, from communication to research. Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper, but online, making library access essential. Being a grade student we have to do a lot of projects that require old books on the city and history. If they remove certain books from the shelf I might not be able to find important information that I need for my education. Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them; however, if everyone found something offensive in a book, movie, or magazine, does that mean it should be removed? If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books, impoverishing our collective resources. I have a friend who is mixed with Mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive, but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history and the history of our nation. This proves that something that might be offensive to one person may not be offensive and maybe very important to the other, highlighting the subjective nature of offense. In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelf due to offensive content; I believe it is wrong. Every person is different and finds different things offensive, but things should not be taken away from another person who might need it for their education or personal growth.
176	3153	2	3	Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example, rated-R movies, most children under seventeen cannot watch them. Either it's a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people might find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offend someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read. Sometimes it might be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-R movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question 'Where do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give. In this situation I am somewhat neutral. I dont object to having things that might offend other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries where children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just might be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either. The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries might not be a smart idea if it's where most children get there books. Parents can always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children to see or know of any sort of things that might be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library where a child might get ahold of it. The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions. Ultimately, the decision involves balancing access with protection, a complex task for any library system.
177	3154	2	3	Dear School Board, I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them. Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these materials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing and historical perspectives that challenge their thinking. If we took everything off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples attention? The shelves would be nearly empty, and the opportunity for genuine learning would be greatly diminished. In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention. Keep these items on the shelves for the enrichment and education of all students.
178	3155	2	3	The censorship in libraries should be as good as it is for that age group. Children of the age thirteen to seventeen should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive. They are at an age where they encounter such language in the world and can process it in a literary context. Children that are younger should not have books in their libraries with much of this profound language. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in. With children that are younger than ten years of age they should not read or see things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot control what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries. Therefore, a tiered system of access based on age and maturity is the most sensible approach for library collections.
179	3156	2	3	I am a citizen of the community and I believe that the censorship on the material in libraries is not good but it could be better. It should be an age limit on certain books and magazines ect. in the library. Somethings younger children shouldn't be able to read because of the maturity level. I remember taking my little sister to the public library and she got a book and began to ask me some words that she shouldn't even be hearing about now. It was an uncomfortable situation that could have been avoided. On the other hand, those books might be needed. Some people need those types of books and magazines for research papers and things like that. Now I consider myself a young adult and I believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong. Its also up to the parent or guardian of the child , if you feel that you dont want your child to read anything thats not appropriate then go with them to the library. But then some children dont have a mature parent or guardian that would tell them what to read and what not so thats when the library should do something about the censorship on the books. Well I jus wanted to write you this because like I stated before the censorship on the books, movies, music, magazines, ect. in the library is ok but it could be jus a little better. There should be a certain age when a child reads or see's certain things. But you can't just take all the books and things out the library that are not appropriate because some people actually need the books. Thats why I believe that it would help if the library had a age limit or made certain things for mature audience only, creating a balanced solution for everyone.
180	3157	2	3	If something is to be found offensive, than it should certainly be removed from the shelves. When parents send or take their children to a library, they do not expect their child to be able to pick up something that is not appropriate. Some items might offend someone's beliefs and be rude. Public libraries are just that, public. Everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people. No one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge. Parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials. Even if the child does not check the book or magazine out, who is to stop that young, impressionable mind from flipping through the pages. Perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time. Books now have a lot of crude text and humor. If there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand, he or she might get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject. If a kid is rummaging through the more adult section of the library, they might be exposed to some information they are not ready for. Offensive language could be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases. If a child read something about sex, he or she might be curious or confused, and ask their parents about it. The parents on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age. At that point there would be no turning back. Parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds. Parents have every right to deny minors and children certain materials, but if the books are out in open, who will censor what is looked at by whom. Libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves, no matter what form the information is in. People might think just because the story was in a book, than of course it can't be real. Some reckless scenarios are played out in movies. Those movies are watched by people of all ages. If an impressionable teenager watches a movies that has offensive language or violent scenes, that teen might act upon what they've seen. Since the public library is indeed public, the materials it offers to people should not be offensive. All sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around. No one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended. No parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up. Libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way, and a careful selection process is essential to maintain this standard of public trust.
181	3158	2	3	I feel that they shouldn't be removed due to the fact that somebody else might like that movie, book, music, or magazine. Just because we might not like it doesn't mean there isn't somebody out there that does. Everything should be in the library because there are different people and not everybody likes the same things. The library is supposed to have a wide variety of materials so if we decided to take something off the shelf because one or a couple more people don't like something or what's being displayed, it wouldn't be right. I have been to the library and been looking for a movie or a book that I like or want to see and it has not been there; I have gotten mad for that. So I feel as if it's not right nor fair. Everybody should have their right to whatever it is that they read or like to watch. Even though there are certain books or movies out there that children should not touch, I still feel as if they shouldn't remove anything off the shelves, as access can be managed through other means like parental guidance or separate sections.
182	3159	2	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I think we should have these certain materials in the libraries. Why I think these materials should stay is because, for instance, let's say it's a certain movie or song or book or whatever, just that one thing you were looking for, for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happened to go to the library just to look. Even though you know it's probably not there, but you are just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you were looking for. And what if you wanted to look for a mystery book and only the library had that exact book you were looking for? The feeling of finally discovering it is incredible. I can think of a lot of reasons why we need certain materials available to everyone. Well I guess that about sums that up for me. And in conclusion, put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? Would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay so that others can have the same chance of discovery?
183	3160	2	3	What is your opinion on reading materials? Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read? Every library has different choices. They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home. I have read many different things in my lifetime so far. I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there. Most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book. I think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not. Everyone reacts to things differently. Let's take people in my age group, for example, some of the boys are still immature, and think it is funny to act out. Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books. Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature, but working their way up the scale. They would be able to handle something in the adult material category. The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle. If we take people's choice away what are they going to have? You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library, and say hey mommy and daddy pick me out a book because I am not eighteen and cannot pick one. I would not like that. Being one that reads a lot I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book. Therefore, I would not be able to read as much. I mean what do you think? Which side would you choose? Everything is a personal opinion. It is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with. Do you want to decide for yourself or have someone with you every step of the way. Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schedule to go to the library. Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read. Why stop someone from getting smarter? A child will only learn more by challenging themselves. Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book, that they got to pick out. What do you think about that?
184	3161	2	3	I believe that libraries shouldn't be censored because people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this because everyone takes offense to something. If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library? Also, everybody likes different things. I'll support them in the following paragraphs. Have you ever read or seen something that you took offense to, for you or others? Normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people were to take away things that offended them in libraries what would be left of the shelves? Dust? Because there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is different. This is one reason I support no on censorship because there would be nothing left. Also everyone tends to like many different things. I might like something you could possibly hate, should it not be allowed in a library because you don't like it? No, because something you like could be taken away by someone else. So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left. I think that because if we combined everyone's things that they hate, it would most likely be everything. These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people can't find what they want because it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and libraries would become empty like their shelves. Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. That's wasted tax dollars we could have used for something better. After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries because everyone is offended by something, everyone likes different things, and no one would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. Some people might disagree with me because they're one of these people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what they're for, allow people to read, research, and watch what they want without unnecessary restrictions.
185	3162	2	3	Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1. It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music or movies. Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting. Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, school system and especially readers. In the @ORGANIZATION1 every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to. School systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school. Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all. The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals. It is not fair to the writer to be discriminated against, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting. The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself. If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights. In general school systems and teachers are power hungry leaders of the student body of a school. They make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights. If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional. The last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students. Censoring a book is taking that person's ability to learn about, and understand a certain topic that was censored. Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals. In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but especially in school must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers. Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers. The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occurring in schools, around the country, everyday to protect intellectual freedom.
186	3163	2	3	What is this world coming to? We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in public libraries where anyone, including young children, can check them out. Being a daughter and a teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines. The explicit sex, rampant drug use, and graphic violence used to create a story have destroyed the impressionable minds of our youth. I strongly feel this disturbing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries immediately. I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they are allowed to read. I agree that reading helps our youth learn and excel in their schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking in a negative manner. The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious and tempted they become. I feel they will eventually let their curiosity get the better of them, leading to dangerous real-life experiments. Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all a part of growing up, but I completely disagree. Trying any one of these harmful activities portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe and lasting danger. It only takes one single time to become pregnant or become tragically addicted to drugs, forever altering a young life. To better prove my point, think of your favorite book from your own childhood. Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him or her? Well, it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model. They might save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include a reckless night life in the story as well. This subtly tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite of what is acceptable. I stand by my opinion and believe all offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of our community libraries. This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth that can grow into serious problems. It leads them to believe everyone, including their heroes in books and movies, does these things and that it is normal. Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for, and our libraries should reflect our highest values, not our lowest temptations.
187	3164	2	3	People often think that graphic images or strong words are going to change the outlook their younger child has on a lot of topics. But really, the kids won't remember half of what they read or see, so does it really matter in the long run? Well, according to some people it does, which I can understand from a protective standpoint, but I will have to go with the side that it doesn't matter too. Because it's not like they're not going to find out about bad language or sex from their friends or the internet anyway, so I say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, etc. The fact of the matter is that people or parents get too offended or complain cause their little child said a curse word in front of them for the first time. Or because some of the material in the show or magazines are too offensive towards people with disabilities, different races, etc. When really, all of this is just humor and satire; none of it is the network or authors being serious or malicious in their intent. Authors' works aren't to be shunned upon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it for entertainment. Through all of this you should know by now that I don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just because little kids' parents are ashamed of what their kid read. Cause like I already said, they are gonna find out about this stuff eventually from other sources. So there is no need getting mad over it and trying to hide reality. And if we got rid of all the more mature books, what kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read for our age group? Cause I'm pretty sure I don't want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home when I am trying to understand more complex themes about life and society.
188	3165	2	3	Dear School Board, My name is Alex. I am a student here at North High School, and it has come to my attention that the Parent-Teacher Association is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library. I think this is wrong and a step in the wrong direction. If everybody at North High took the books we found personally offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with no books to read and a barren library. I also think that no one person or small group should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read. I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make my own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading. If I feel I should read books that others might find offensive then, why does that concern you? Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to read it as well; we can all make our own choices. Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting and realistic. If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it and it would lose its authentic voice. If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what North High School is looking to do for its students. If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways between classes. This is a public high school. Kids cuss all the time, and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read from this library. If you're looking to make children more innocent, then taking all of our books out of the library is not the logical way to go about achieving that goal.
189	3166	2	3	Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience. Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it may not be something that they are supposed to be reading at their age. When an author writes a children's book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult looking for complex themes. Also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the author is talking about and can act maturely while reading its content. Although some novels may not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not the way to fix that, and it is a big mistake for a free society. As humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those fundamental freedoms is the freedom of the press. Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about, expressing their own ideas. If they choose to write about subjects that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries for their intended readers. Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are and they have that right. If you take those books away because you're scared that a child might get ahold of one, then you're taking away what certain people enjoy reading and learn from. Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors and genres. They have a children's section made primarily for children, an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read, and a teen section for everyone in between. By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books from the collection. Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it may be, and cutting out certain books all together from the system. If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want without judgment. If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive for their own family. Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like on their own. If a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out from the library. Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered as a viable solution. Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material in today's world, so there really is no point to censoring anything in our public libraries.
190	3167	2	3	I think that all offensive materials should be removed from the main areas of libraries so every one can read a book, listen to music, and watch movies with out being offended by the content. They should have their own separate section for that kind of material, away from the general collection. Movies that are deemed bad or inappropriate should be taken off the open shelf. They should have a section just for those movies, perhaps in a separate room or behind a counter. The section should be locked up or require adult permission so children can't get access to those movies on their own. I think that this would be a fair compromise for everyone who uses the library. Music that is considered bad or explicit should be taken off the general shelf as well. They should have a section just for that kind of music, clearly marked for mature audiences. The section should be locked up in a cabinet so children can't get that kind of music without supervision. I think that this would be fair for everyone, allowing access while providing a barrier. Magazines that are bad or contain adult content should be taken off the open shelf. These magazines should have a section just for those specific titles, not mixed in with general interest periodicals. They should be locked up or placed behind the desk to control access. I think that this would be fair for every one, protecting children while allowing adult choice. Books that are bad or contain offensive themes should be taken off the general shelf. They should have a section just for these books, possibly requiring a librarian's assistance. These books should be locked up so children cant get them easily without an adult present. I think that this would be fair for everyone, balancing freedom with responsibility. This is what I think should be done with all of this offensive material found in our public libraries. If this was done, everyone would have a book to read, a magazine to look at, music to listen to, and a movie to watch in an environment that respects both safety and choice.
191	3168	2	3	Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, explicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't. Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, television shows, movies, on the internet, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material. Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general, fostering a healthier environment for their development.
192	3169	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views. A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightenment. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on Catholicism but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? This goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another. Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inappropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not allowed to roam the library without an adult. This is a very prominent rule because it sets boundaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults. Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries because they are found offensive because this is censorship and it takes away our rights to access a full spectrum of knowledge and ideas.
193	3170	2	3	I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us. If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me. Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like. One of them is Romance Books I hate them with all of my heart. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is Comic Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read. So I think that it is a wast of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is Foreign Books because they are hard to read them in another language. Their are lot's of music out there I dont like. One of them is Country. I dont know why I dislike Country but I do. The next type Pop music. The singer in todays Pop music I think are no good. The last type of music is some of todays rap. I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words. Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like. The first one is The Matrix. I did not get the hole plut of that movie. The next one Children of the corn. Their was no way I could find out way the children was killing the people over thirty in that town. The last movie that I did not like was ALL the Batman movies. I just did not like them ok? I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are thing people like but I dont like them. Their things that my friend like but I dont like. Their thing I like and they dont like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like. But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world just because they are not to your personal taste.
194	3171	2	3	Our founding fathers creating amendments for the people. One of the greatest is the freedom of speech. Censorship of offensive materials is unnecessary. Books, music, movies, and magazines sometimes have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them. Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing. People have the right to say how they feel by any medium. Censorship of anything makes a child more immature. Book burning is a horrible action by any person. People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas. In the book Fahrenheit 451, firemen would burn any book seen within a home. Almost ever single book in the world is not factual, unless it is nonfiction. The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government. That basically means every kind of book out there. The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games. Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment. Also, the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more. Libraries have no right to censor books. Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation. Why should it change now? Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out. They may have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard. Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs. Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies. I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the Harry Potter series because of the use of sorcery. She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft. I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it. When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious. After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they jus saw. The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist. Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body. Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't the child should watch porn. Censory has always been taken the wrong way. People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about. We should not get rid of the obscenity at all. We should have an understanding of the bad things in life. Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind. Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed. Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter, as it limits our capacity to learn and understand the world in its entirety.
195	3172	2	3	Should books, magazines, movies, and music be put in higher reaches of children, or should they be left in plain sight? Is it fair to not be capable to see a movie, magazine, or even read a book because others in the area believe it's offensive in their view? If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel it's only for their eyes to see then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason for this is because, it's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed to others oppinions. If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and releasr them to stands for them to be sold. If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track. There are many chances for school projects that might require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get it is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website might be inappropriate. For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the weekend about World War II for a grade. Monday comes and he/she doesn't have it and gets a zero for the homework he/she was assigned. The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information. He/she starts explaing themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked. The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' 'It's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.' The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' 'That sounds good, at least it's better then getting an zero on the assignment,' said the student. Tuesday afternoon comes, adn the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands it to the teacher. At the end of class it gets graded and the grade on it turns out to be a B. Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start. This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves. Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault. If only a few citizens have oppinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them. Even if it's for safety of the children they may have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of excpet for that one particular person, but they should not impose their views on the entire community.
196	3173	2	3	Bad movies in the 1990s libraries can be a real issue. Libraries are a great place to learn about many things, from earths history to where will we be in the future. I think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people. Even movies and music can be offensive to some people. I think the music of the 1990s is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive. Movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times, especially when they are historically inaccurate. There are many reasons movies can be offensive. If they are offensive why put them in the libraries? Well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products. For example a World War II documentary movie that is inaccurrate and poorly made might be offensive to real life World War II documentary veterans. The veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves. I have seen some great World War II documentary movies but I have also see some bad ones too. My grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad World War II documentary and got so upset he cursed at the television and almost threw the remote at it. Then ther is the problem with the music of the 1990s. I do not think stores including libraries should sell albums of the 1990s's rap artists because all the talk about is drugs, sex, and girls. If you ask me its stupid. But when you start selling them in a library there is something wrong with that librariy. Some country singers can be like that to because all the sing about is getting drunk then having sex. I just think the most of the music of the 1990s is really pointless and a waste of time because when I listen to it I think this is stupid and makes no sinces. Books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer. Books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words. Why put it on the shelves of libraries then? Well it all lead back to money. If people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes. I read a book that was about some one killing cats and I found that offensive because I love cats I would never hurt them. I got really mad when I read it so I threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them. So over all the libraries should be more carefull on what they put on the shelves for people to buy. If the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit. But if they do not put offensive things on the shelves they will not end up being in a law suit, which is a much better outcome for everyone involved.
197	3174	2	3	I do believe that some places have magizines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelfs. Just think, if you had childern would you want them getting ahold of a magizine with nude men or women in it. Yes people tell you they have control of there kids in stores, but i know you see kids all the time walking away or roming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldnt be like magizines for instence. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magizine with nude wemon in it? Thats not the things kids should be finding in stores, its not nessacary. Same deal goes with movies, say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it, do want that around your kids? i know i wouldnt, cause kids are like monkeys, monkey see monkey do, and you dont want your little one walking aroud cussing at you. I have little cousins and ive seen it happen many times where they cuss back at there parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that its usually the same answer, tv or movies. So do you really think it's nessacary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone, of many ages to see? It's not. Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelf and destoryed, cause I shouldnt have to see it and niether should anyone else, its gross, nasty, and inrepropriet to childern. I say get read of it all and do everyone a favor by creating a cleaner and more appropriate environment for our families.
198	3175	2	3	Libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines. However, are all of these materials appropriate for all library visitors? In this essay I will explain to you why I think offensive, distracting and inappropraite material should be removed off of the shelves, and put into their own section of public libraries. If a small child were to walk into a public library and pick up a book about abortions, they would not know what the book is talking about, because most small children cannot read. What if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up? They would be able to read  the whole thing with no problems. However, should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age? I dont think so, fifth graders should be reading age appropriate books. This is just one reason why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the library. When I think of a library I think of a quiet place that I can go to and read, or study. Although, some Libraries allow their visitors to listen to music. Rather it be on a computer, on a ipod, or even on a cell phone, there should be a sound limit right? Most people would think that Libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people do not follow directions and they are not attentive to what other people are doing. It is very distracting to go into a library, to study, and the person next to you has their ipod blasted to a heavy metal rock song. Once again, this is another reason I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the library. I also think that a library is a community place, that you can go to and be safe, and your parents would not have to go with you because they think that it is safe and appropriate too. Most Libraries have magazines, because its for your entertainment, and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back. Well not all magazines are rated G, some have very inappropriate material in them. A child should be looking at magazines that are appropriate for children, a teenager should be looking at magazines that are for teenagers, and an adult should be looking at magazines for adults. However the adult magazines should not be showing people with barely any clothes on, or any sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines. With innapropriate magazines, I do not think they should have their own section of the library, I think they should be removed all together. They have pictures in them and anyone can look at a picture. I really hope you can understand my point of view. It is nothing against public Libraries, it is just the material inside of them. If I owned a public library, I would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups. For example, I would have a room for 18+, and a room for 13+. Those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children. I would also have my own room devoted for music only. That way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want, no questions asked. The rest of the library would be for people to study, and read. I think every library should be like this, it would help make the world a better place by ensuring a more organized and considerate environment for all patrons.
199	3176	2	3	Hello, my name is John and I think that books, newspapers, and magazines being censored should be done but shouldn't. When I say that I mean that some books dealing with adventure or romance might have parts that need to be censored, but thats how the author made the book. It was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story. I believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the country and other people around the world. Magazines in my opinion should be censored. Now some make it to where there less inaproperate which is somewhat a good thing, but others pretty much just let it slide and figure it will raise the sales by how ever much percent they want it to be considering what they put in the magazine. I feel that books should stay on the shelf however. Some people feel that the 'censored' parts of the story are really what catches there attention. I myself have never had an expirence in this field because im not one to be a strong reader, but knowing how other people are, I would suggest that we censor some things, but not all. People write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination. So we can't really help what people think about and what some people write down to be published in a book. For some readers, it is a very interesting story or passage being read from the back cover of the book, while others just want the book gone from there neighborhood library or out of their house. It all really depends on the reader. If I could, there would be things I would censor, but not in books. It was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid. Some readers appriciate it, while others do not. It is really their choice to read the book and if its not appealing to them they can simply put it back on the shelf and find another close to it. I just feel that some magazines should be censored. Constantly, you see swimsuit models and 'sexual appeal' in magazines everyday when you enter the grocery store or library. I just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when there looking for a Dr. Seuss book or a book about their favorite animal. Another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine. People everyday become Christians and being right with God, so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines. I myself as a Christian take offense to some of these magazines, promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage. As I have said, I am to the understanding of the books having what they have in them, because of the authors imagination, but some magazines just need to be thrown off the shelf to maintain a more wholesome community space.
200	3177	2	3	The way i see it movies or books shouldnt be taken off the shelf .becouse it should be up to ower own right to take a movie or to tonot take the movie .Also music such as country or sad music ant like movies or books how can u take music of the radio u canot do it .Becouse it dnt matter what u do with the radio shut it off turn it down or change the chanel with the way the world is now days there will all ways be things on the radio that u wont wanna hear and there will be things that u do wanna hear ,thats my opinion about movies and music. Also if there was any way to keep movies away i would probaly have it done there are goood movies and there are bad but one movie that is afensive and shy is (shylo) about the old man hittin the dog and stuff thats verry afensive to some one that was raised around beetings. Ultimately, the decision of what to watch or listen to should remain a personal choice for each individual.
201	3178	2	3	We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you? Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material. We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to. I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read Stephen King novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read Stephen King novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of Stephen King's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me. We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.
202	3179	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no I do not. It is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completely remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it. I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express their thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. Sometimes stories cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Whether those words be good or bad I feel like without them the book that is being read is not all of what it could have been. In my opinion censorship takes away from certain values or qualities the book could have had with the original context still in it. And to me that is not fair. It's not fair to the author. And is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book. I know from my personal experiences with reading books that 'yes' I have read books that have had bad language in them. But just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completely taken off the shelf. For example the book 'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than I have any other book that I have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being censored or taken off the shelf for that matter. All I am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. Because that is getting away from what the overall message is about. You're almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No I do not. Neither should you.
203	3180	2	3	Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict. We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter what precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too young to see them, like under the age of thirteen. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though. Cosmopolitan is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occasional 'what to wear this season!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. Cosmopolitan, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon. Say a child around the age of ten is listening to the new Eminem song. He is being introduced to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the three minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending seven hours of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated. I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconsciously) to participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with what it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up too fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed.
204	3181	2	3	The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropriate, another may find obscene and vulgar. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, may insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person. A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house. To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public. No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inappropriate or vulgar something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, separate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect. Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves would be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove. A religious family that believes Harry Potter, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelves of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose. The graphic novels I find inappropriate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropriate, instead of the world. Although not everything is appropriate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to censor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be removed from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessible manner.
205	3182	2	3	There are many different people in this world, who have many different opinions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc., just because one person does not particularly like horror movies, that does not mean that movie stores should remove horror films from their shelves. As creepy as it may sound, there are many people in the world who are slasher film freaks. They live and breathe scary movies. I myself like just about everything out there. I will read any book or listen to any type of music; it actually widens my taste in certain materials. I feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were Winnie the Pooh. and you would like to share your childhood stories with your children. BUT suddenly, book stores took Winnie the Pooh off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsense. Many people like many different things. There is no reason to only sell what you like. Otherwise your business will fail.
206	3183	2	3	What is considered offensive? If we took books, music, movies, and magazines that people found offensive off shelves, there would be nothing left. Everyone is different, which means they all get offended in different ways. By taking all this off shelves, we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world. Things we learn about in school, such as slavery, wars, and some politics, could offend many people. But if we were to take them off the shelves at schools and libraries, children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alcohol? Many parents do not talk to their children about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources, they might never know the harm that they can do to someone's body. Everyone takes something as offensive, but not everyone takes the same thing as offensive. So who is to say what offends people and what does not? If that's the case, shouldn't we take all books, movies, music, and magazines away from children's schools and libraries? Adults get offended too, so would we take all of their resources away also, including the newspaper? By taking away what one person calls offensive, we might land in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing, because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive. Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone might get offended by talking about one's race, another might get offended by talking about religion, and someone might even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat. Everyone looks at everything differently. So why try and control us all as one? All people think different, and they know what they want to read, hear, and watch all by themselves; they don't need someone to tell them what is acceptable for their own minds and perspectives.
207	3184	2	3	Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, such as schools and TV shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intended for young children should not be censored. If you were to censor everything because some people find it offensive, then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community. Censoring books, movies, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a waste of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explained the theory of evolution because a person found it offensive, then we would never make advances in technology. Censoring items like books is just plain idiotic and ignorant. Studying material is our only way to advance in science, and if we can't get the right books to study because they were taken off the shelf due to being offensive, then we will never make breakthroughs in technology. Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really aren't good parents. If they really were concerned with those topics, then they shouldn't buy them the movies or the books that they find offensive. It seems that some parents want to proclaim they want to censor those items because they find them offensive. But not all parents feel the same way; some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their children are mature enough to handle things like these. As a child, I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up without censorship. I watched movies and read books that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all meant. I see why parents want to censor their kids from topics like those, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topics and see if they are mature enough to handle it. Censorship is great for children's TV shows. But when you start to censor someone's ideas because you find them offensive and wrong, then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and deserve the right to not have their work censored because a small group finds it offensive. Censorship is a great tool, but only if it is used right and applied appropriately.
208	3185	2	3	Book Censorship? Should books be censored? This is a national problem about the contents of books. It is a big deal. What one parent feels is very offensive, another might feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn. If you ask me that question, I would say, 'Yes, I believe books should be censored, but to a national scale and not a community one.' By this I mean a book with things like references to nudity or other things of a vulgar nature, not just because it has a bad word in it that a parent feels to be inappropriate for their child. I believe there should be a national rating system for books, like there is in the movie industry. Also, I believe that it is the parents' job to regulate what their children read. If they believe the book is vulgar or inappropriate but the system doesn't, then they need to prevent their children from reading it without taking it off the shelf. It is the parents' job to regulate the reading of their children, not the contents of the bookshelf. Like in Katherine Paterson's statement: 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' By this, I believe she means that if we all took a book off the shelves for our children, there would be no books left because what is not offensive to you might be very offensive to another parent. So the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids. Yes, I believe in a government censorship program, but only to an extent. It is the parents' job to regulate the readings of their children, but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf for everyone else.
209	3186	2	3	No, I would not think it would be the right thing to do. To just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them is not fair. It is not only one person's place to decide that. People, or some people, would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf because it's offensive to them. Just because one person finds that book or books offensive doesn't mean that they should have the right to just throw the book away. There could be many people out there that really like that book or those books, and they wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore, all because one person or a few other people don't like the book. Yes, there are books out there that a lot of people don't like, but that still doesn't give one person the right to throw the book out, all because they don't like that book or that series of a book. No one should have the right to just take a book that they don't like out of a library and throw it out because they don't like it. There could be a smart little boy or girl that likes that book, and because that one person threw it away because they don't like it, now that little boy or girl won't get to read their favorite book. That's why I don't think books that someone thinks is offensive should be taken out of a library. Because there's always someone out there that likes that one book that you might want to throw away. If you think the book is that offensive to you, just stay away from that area of the library and don't think about that book, allowing others the freedom to choose for themselves.
210	3187	2	3	The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie, etc., everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many people's points of view, it shouldn't be available to the public. I personally believe that if something is seen as vulgar and offensive, it shouldn't be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this, and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well, and something so negative could change the mindset of the child. We all want to bring our kids up right, and letting them have availability to negative material is uncalled for. It's not only kids either that are affected; adults also are affected by the media. Adults can get fooled too, believe me, and negative influences can shape their views in harmful ways. I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I believe that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things. Some students may not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student, leading to misunderstandings or negative behaviors. I believe that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough, I stand for whoever it is that did it. Nothing with a negative effect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child. There should be a positive effect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities, surrounded by constructive and uplifting material.
211	3188	2	3	I think that they should remove certain books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse and worse like everyday. Specifically, i think they should move the age for unrestricted access from @NUM1 to @NUM2, so at least they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want with more maturity. However, they should go through and do a thorough self-check on everything that they put out on the shelves in the stores to ensure it's appropriate. They should also have different, clearly separated parts in a library so that the little ones dont accidentally get to the adult section, which would contain adult books that have explicit stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that category. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents did at their age, and its because now a days kids pick up on information a lot more easier due to the internet and media. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to be more vigilant and watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can easily get a hold of. When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday companies and media are coming out with something new that can negatively effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a dedicated class about the real-world stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, starting in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already be educated about the dangers of drugs, or the realities of sex life. Kids also remember information a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age in an appropriate manner, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will completely stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population involved in these things will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up silly stories so that there kid wont know the truth; they need to stop doing that because the children are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now from a trusted source? they would be more aware of the real life and how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life. So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.
212	3189	2	3	Books have been a part of every single person's life as soon as they learn to read. First our parents read us bedtime books to get us to go to sleep. Then our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied during story time. Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read specific books for our classes. There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be receipts or orders or recipes for a cook. Reading is something that we simply cannot get away from in daily life. This leads me to say that authors write books for a specific audience and write the book as best they can to attract the attention of that intended audience. I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on. I think that there are simple things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book, like just choosing another one. There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive, such as previewing them. Also there are advantages to reading books that might show something different that that person may not have experienced before, offering a new perspective. First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive. Everyone has an opinion and just because one person does not like the book, should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else who might enjoy it. If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book and return it. Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also find value in it. That is just a part of humans having their own unique opinions and tastes. On a different note, I think that childrens' books are a little bit different and require more care. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children from content they feel is unsuitable. I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children's reading materials. For young children, I think that parents should just read the book first themselves and judge whether or not they think they're child should read it. Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up some things about the book online or ask a librarian. The internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books that can guide these decisions. Therefore, I believe that censorship for childrens' books is a responsibility of the parent, not the library. Lastly, I think books are unique in that they are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently by each reader. When I read a book, I think about the plot scheme, imagine the characters, and react to the events, and I come up with my own opinion of the book. My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinion of the very same book based on their own life. But we both gained something valuable by reading the book and sharing our thoughts. In conclusion, I think that books should be censored only by parents for their own children and that is it. I think that reading books is a very positive thing that expands the mind. So no one should have the right to tell other people what they should and should not read based on personal offense. Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about, which is a beautiful thing. It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf waiting for the right reader.
213	3190	2	3	I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive by some. Many people have their own unique taste in what they like to read, write and do for entertainment. Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelves so people can freely choose what they enjoy best. Books and magazines can certainly be offensive to some, but they can also entice and captivate the reader with their themes. I personally love books about gritty topics like drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things because they feel real. In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library, which I find frustrating. If they took all inappropriate books out of the library, what would I read? Not everything in life can be just peachy keen all the time. Its not like that in real life, so why should we have to read about a little fantasy world that we know isnt true or realistic? I know I would'nt want to read that kind of sanitized material. Just like books and magazines, every one has their own taste in music genres. Some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock. If you took the songs that were deemed offensive off the shelf that would make many people angry. That's like not playing a song on the radio thats offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degradeing to women. If it can be played on the public radio, why cant it be available in a library? They are going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway, so removing it is pointless. Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects, and yet many people are interested in these movies. If you can watch that movie in a public movie theatre, why cant you check it out of a library for home viewing? Some people go to check out educational movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent that day. What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf? Fail the assignment? I know I would become angry if that would happen to me and I couldn't complete my schoolwork. We should keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelves. People will eventually see them, hear them, and watch them even if its not in the library, so it's better to provide access than to pretend the content doesn't exist. Even if you take out offensive materials, they are still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do, so censorship is ultimately a futile effort.
214	3191	2	3	When have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you feel the need to complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf? Have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are even reading it in the first place? Why would you continue to read a book that you know you're not going to like from the start? These are questions we should ask ourselves before demanding removal. If someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the exact same right as them to keep it there. I thought everyone was treated by equal rights in this country. When I ever do read, I always read the back of the book or whats called the summary of the story so I can see if I'm going to like it or not before I commit. If I know a book is going to offend me or a magazine or even a movie, most likely I'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them; I just move on to something else. Obviously the author doesnt like censorship or she wouldnt be arguing about it in her work. It's obviously something that bothers her deeply and everyone is intitiled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs on the matter. I respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard prediciments, like fighting for intellectual freedom. I can honestly say I don't always go to libraries and read books because I'm not a huge reader. But I can tell you if I ever did go to a library and I found a book on the shelf that offends me, its probably going to be fine for someone else. So why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people if it's just one opinion? Everyone is intitled to their own opinion, that is a fundamental right. But I think if a book is going to offend someone in particular, it's probably going to bother someone else too, but that doesn't justify its removal. I'm not saying everyone is alike but most people believe in things that other people believe in, forming communities. People can have the same agreements and disagreements, which is normal. I do have to agree with @PERSON1 because she is right in her assessment. You would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by; it's incredibly subjective. I have tons of personal experiences with movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me on some level. But I didnt let it pull me down or anything; I just moved on. For example, I simply stopped watching the movie, and I stopped reading the book that bothered me, problem solved. You can't wear your emotions on your shoulders in a public space, but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe in a respectful manner. You shouldn't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your own opinions; that's not fair. If certain things offend you, don't let them bother you to the point of censorship; just stop doing what your doing and move on to something else that you enjoy. Like I said, I have had a lot of experiences with offensive things I have read and watched over the years. Like awhile back I watched a historical movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do. It was just because the time era was racist and it was also because he was black, which was a common tragedy. Thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me and makes me angry at injustice. Because we are all the same human beings inside. We may look different on the outside and see things different from our perspectives, but our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air on this planet. I have always gone by the saying, 'Don't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it' yourself and form your own view. So whatever people might think, I believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in without interference. Don't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel about creative works. I agree with Katherine Paterson and her stance against censorship.
215	3192	2	3	When I go to a library I might occasionally find some stuff that is offensive to me personally. But if something is offensive to me, the person standing right beside me may not think the same thing is offensive to him or her at all; it's all about individual perspective. When people try to put strict boundaries on what is offensive and what is not, they simply can not succeed because offense is subjective. There is a wide variety of people in the world that all have diffrent opinions based on their personal history, culture, and upbringing. What I think is offensive might be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded in other people's eyes, and that is their right. The major problem with censorship is that the word 'offensive' doesn't have a single, set definition that applies to everyone. I don't think that you will ever find a definition for 'offensive' that everyone can agree on, which makes blanket bans impossible. There needs to be some logical limitations in place to keep certain mature things away from certain age groups, which is just common sense. For example, you would not want a kindergardener to be able to check out a @CAPS1 rated movie from the library, as that would be irresponsible. Some basic censoring has to be done by institutions to protect young people from clearly harmful content, but it should be minimal. But it all comes down to using our common sense when making these decisions for a community. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive on a detailed level, but if we use our common sense and focus on age-appropriateness, the problem can be largely solved without removing access for adults
216	3193	2	3	Certain people believe that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off of the shelves of libraries. I think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves. It is a person's own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so. It is also not another person's right to decide what other people can and cannot observe. If certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music, books etc., the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know and that is not right. It is someone's personal decision whether or not they look at, listen to, or read offensive things. People shouldn't be sheltered by society and only know what is wanted for them to know. If libraries eliminated offensive media then people would not be able to form their own opinions and ideas. In some cases reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world. One case is how people should know about the holocaust in the 1940s. I am sure reading about the holocaust is very offensive to copious amounts of people, but even though this history is disturbing and offensive people should know about it so that history does not repeat itself. The government and society does not have the right to decide what people take in. For example what if all of a certain type of music was eliminated from libraries, the internet, and tv; it would slowly dissolve out of existence. Certain things like reading about the times before racial equality, and such things as slavery are very offensive for people to read about. But these things must be read and heard and passed down through history so it isn't forgotten. The knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries. Yes offensive things shouldn't be celebrated or looked upon as good but people should know. People in the world can't just know the good things or only what their society wants them to know, they also have to know about the bad things and offensive things that happen and have happened as well. Ultimately, access to a full spectrum of information is essential for a free and informed populace.
217	3194	2	3	Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they might find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they might not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that might be offensive to one person, but to another it might not be. Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, their difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book. I don't believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then don't get rid of it just because of a couple people. Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and disagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offended by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it. Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences. So don't remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people decide on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what different views you might find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their views on the book and then debate on whether or not to keep it, so don't choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book. A collective and democratic process is the most equitable way to manage library collections.
218	3195	2	3	Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain, as every piece of media is likely to offend someone. As Americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an American citizen. Personally, I hate rap. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed? One of my favorite series is the Christy Miller series, by Robin Jones Gunn. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growing up by depending on God, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a Christian series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive? Although some wish they could eliminate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are supposed to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive. This balance ensures that libraries fulfill their role as a cornerstone of a free society.
219	3196	2	3	Censorship in books is one of the main concerns in America. If it was up to me to remove a book from a shelf, I would not do it, to my personal opinion, I think that we as Americans should just read over the problems and quit complaining about it. Yes, we do have some books that people seem to not like, such as 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', but the only reason that it has been pulled off the shelves of libraries and schools is because it uses the word 'nigger', and I find it to be kind of idiotic, that people would over react to that word when themselves were not even around to know the real meaning of. Censorship in music. This is another big concern for people in America. The lyrics used in most songs I find to be 'disturbing' or are trying to get people and young kids to commit acts of crime and other illegal acts. Music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are whats making kids do stupid stuff, the music talks about sex, drug usage, and murder. I don't think that I would go as far as to pull it off the shelf, but I would make the sellers put them in a 'can only purchase if 18' section. Most of the crime we have today people blame on music. To my observation about these subjects are that I have seen people read a book that uses profound language in it and be ok with it, they don't over react to it so therefore it shouldn't be removed from shelves. To my observation about the rap music, sure, in a way it should be pulled off the shelves and never be sold again, but, I have seen people who listen to it and never smoke, never kill, and never harms another person. To my own experience I listen to some of these gore obsessed bands and read profound language books and got over it, these thing should be overlooked and forgotten. This is just a common sense thing but, there are a lot of things that should be pulled off shelves, I would, and it has to do with movies and magazines. Some movies have always been a problem to society, I have witnessed this that some movies show just a little bit too much nudity in it, which I seem to think is not a good thing that our younger children should see, whether it's at the theater or on t.v. these things should be pulled. My observation about magazines it that I have personally heard one of my best friends say that 'I want to look as skinny as this girl does on this magazine because I'm too fat'. There are a lot of magazines that should not be showed or read because it does say that skinny is better and so many girls and women are starving themselves to look like the person on the cover of a magazine, and it's ridiculous to see that happen, If it was my choice, I would ban these materials from usage or sight, mainly because this is all just one big peer pressure conspiracy. I would not ban all of the things that I have put in this paper, just the things that I that personally find disturbing or not fit for the publics eyes. In the end, a measured approach is necessary, focusing on specific harms rather than broad censorship.
220	3197	2	3	I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries. In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing. Also, it depends on what the ages the kids are or adults. People are different in many ways. It also depends on the way they take it in their own interpretation. If they move books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves because they're offensive that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people get ahold of it and want to read it in life, if they get taken off the shelves? Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else. I just don't think that people would be too happy. Also, they're different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that. People would like to learn about different things. If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read. Children's and up to adult books has all different kinds of things. The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things, sometimes they can have more information in those books than others. In my conclusion, censorship is not good in our public libraries because it is taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people, thereby limiting the diversity of thought and information available to the community.
221	3198	2	3	If the library is in a high school, then we are all old enough that we have already seen or heard anything and everything offensive. In case we haven't, though, you can't shield your kids from offensive material. This overprotection hurts them in the long run. Such as when your boss gets to work and you or someone around you messes up an important assignment or task he might use terms such as the 'f-word' or other vulgar terms to describe how mad he is. If you were to just hear those for the first time being yelled at you, there is a chance you would have a break down or be ineffective for work. Now I'm not saying we should all 'cuss' every day and talk in vulgar tongue. I'm just saying that the real world doesn't have a 'clean' version. There is no mom or dad there to stand by and say, 'oh no, that's not acceptable speech, son'. If you took a survey of the daily language of teens and young adults, almost ninety percent would say they use some form of vulgar language or inappropriate terms. We need to have our kids and teens to know it's not ok to say those things, and they need to know what is acceptable in society and what is not. But taking the books from them in the library and then thrusting them into a world with daily inappropriate acts is not right and does them a great disservice.
222	3199	2	3	Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' She is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something against it, then we would hardly have any books at our libraries. Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that effect our opinions. Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I don't like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldn't bother me, but that would be extremely selfish. Even if something is totally inappropriate and offensive, it is still information. Maybe it shouldn't go in the little kids section of a library or store, but I don't think it should be removed completely. Music especially. There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I despise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people I know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive, but that's just how things are. So no, I don't think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We can't hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove the materials we don't care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then we're left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech, we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy without fear of it being taken away.
223	3200	2	3	I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things, but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries. Books are written to stimulate the imagination of a person's mind, and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever written until that person has grown up. And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind, and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics. For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature. So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets there he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive. What would that person do? Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country? I say no! This is a problem because almost every great book ever written has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader. From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career. For example, when I was in the tenth grade I was assigned a book report over Huckleberry Finn, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found. I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro imprinted on its pages. So I asked her if I could go to the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well. I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over. So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not one student was able to find Huckleberry Finn. But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem. Another example was when my friend Ahmed wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from. But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the Arabic world. So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia?' And the librarian said that they were all removed because after 9/11 some people saw Arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked. I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found Arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race. These are only a few things that have already happened because of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by. Sure people have a freedom of speech, but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf. Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect public libraries.
224	3201	2	3	There are a lot of things on the library shelves that you might be concerned about. You might be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, language it contains, and what kind of advertising. Some things I have experienced is with the language it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies that have cusswords. Also some materials might have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that there is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff. Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as it's good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in their hand, and we think it's cool to try it, but it's not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or incents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin your whole career in high school and maybe in college. The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, there could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines there can be pictures in which you don't approve in either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have inappropriate scenes, and inappropriate pictures. Some things are like what pictures it contains, language it contains, and what kind of advertising there is. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You might be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. There are a lot of things on the library shelves that you might be concerned about, but ultimately it is up to individuals to choose what they consume.
225	3202	2	3	Books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. Books tell stories fiction or non-fiction. Many books that might be found offensive are historical. These books could include topics such as wars, eras, people, etc. Everyone has the same rights to read any book they want. They also have the right to not read the book at all. Books that are taken off the shelves of a library because of one person, or a group of people, being offended hinders the ability of someone who wants to read the book, to read the book. We, as people, should not be able to take this right away from other people. They should be able to read anything they want. If someone wants to read a biography or history about Adolf Hitler, they should be able to. The topic of Hitler and the Nazi Party might be found to be offensive because of what they stand for. If we look at the topic as purely a historical reference not as a story to be read for enjoyment there will never be any offence in these books. These stories have a large role in history. If we do not learn from their mistakes, history might repeat itself. History is around to be studied, even if the topics might be offensive to some people. Political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story. Such as in To Kill a Mockingbird. This book has many issues when it comes to political correctness. These issues include; the killing of an innocent man and revealing the flaws in our judicial system, the use of the word 'nigger' to describe the black characters, and the racial inequality of the South during the 1930's. These issues would definitely be offensive to some readers, but this book is an award winner and uses history as a guide. The situations in this novel are ones that could be real. They are things we must learn about, so we do not repeat them. Another story that fits quite well into this topic is Fahrenheit 451. This novel is about a world where all books are burnt. No books are allowed to be read by the people. This book reveals the removal of offensive books to its extreme. No matter who you are or what you believe, there will be some topics that you find offensive. If we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library. A library is not a library without its books. If we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves, we will not be able to stop it. One day we will end up like the world in Fahrenheit 451. No history will be known but what is passed down. No more stories will be here to entertain us, but the ones memorized. No books will exist and this world would be terrible without books. Books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. The taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want. It reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish. Political correctness should not take the place of our own freedom, and as long as we keep our books on their shelves, it won't.
226	3203	2	3	I believe that libraries should have more censorship. Some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age. From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use. Young children should not be exposed to those things yet. First, I think books that contain violence should be removed. I believe that children are the easiest people to influence. I also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by. Violence in books can influence killing. Fighting and killing is not good. No young child should be able to check out a book full of shooting and fighting. The book will make the kids think that's the right thing to do if they are able to check it out. Being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes. Reading a book is not worth going to jail for. Next, I believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries. Sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it. For example, a young girl reading about teen pregnancy not being a problem. The reader will think that is what she is supposed to do which is wrong. Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children. Those things can influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing. You can at least sort them all in an adult section. Finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids. Children should not read or watch anything that is talking about drugs in a positive way. Unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all. Drugs make people do things that their right mind doesn't want them to do. Children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite. In conclusion, that is why I believe that we need censorship in our libraries. We need censorship because of violence and drug use. Also because of sexual activity and many more things that are not suitable for young minds.
227	3204	2	3	Dear newspaper and staff, It has come to my attention that it is being considered that most libraries in the community might have a removal or censorship of some books in the library. I find this not acceptable; in my opinion this is an attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offensive reading material from further generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labeled 'A Child's Struggle', this book describes a child's hardships and the abuse he takes on a daily basis. Books of this sort are not only informative, they also give the reader an open mind on how things might have been. Some topics might include; slavery, abuse, war, and discrimination. These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society. Censoring and removal of these books are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. It is strictly important for our generations to be aware of the hardships, problems, and lessons in which these topics arose. Without informing our generations of these issues it could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent! My opinion on movies however is a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purposeful acts of discrimination or offensive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offensive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least PG-13 or rated R; this allows certain age groups able to watch material that might be offensive or perhaps discriminating. They might also need adult accompaniment to preview the movie. So in my closing I would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive or discriminating issues. I just fully believe open library content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plenty of observations must be made by parents or guardians if needed. I appreciate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks! Sincerely, A Concerned Reader.
228	3205	2	3	Everyone today gets offended daily. So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelves is no different than the rest of the day. However, there are those minds, which have not been polluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep their minds that way. One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the library while the lower rated material is put on display for the public. The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way. Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things meant for inside of marriage, often accomplish nothing of great value in their life time. They are thus a hindrance to society. But if they cannot access the material, they then need something to do to fill that time. In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty Bible off the shelf. This thus leaves the libraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a secluded room, or they can remove definite offensive material and keep society on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to observe. Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendance goes up as a result of a more curated environment.
229	3206	2	3	Have you ever found or seen books, music, movies, or magazines in a library that are offensive to you? If so, then would you have wanted to remove it off of the shelf so none of your children or anyone else that might have found it offensive, to see it? Well, I have actually gone to the library and seen some things that was offensive to me, and I have also heard my family members talking about it. So I am going to talk about what I have heard about my family seeing or finding books, music, movies, and magazines offensive. Also, I am going to explain how I felt and what I wanted to do when I seen those things in a library that was offensive to me. The last thing that I am going to talk about is how I feel on censorship in libraries. First, I have been hearing from my sisters, my mother, and my step-mother about how they find some books, music, movies, and magazines at a library that was offensive to them. Now I do not know exactly what the books, magazines, etc., was that they found offensive but I do know what they thought about them and what they wanted to do. So one day, my sisters, mother, and step-mother was talking about a couple of books that she found offensive. They never said what the books were but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them. Now she told my family and I that she was badly offended by what they were called and what they were about. Also she was saying that she would have really liked to have taken the books, music, movies, etc., off of the shelves, so other people that might have found them offensive would not see them. But, they all did also agree on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves. Their reason why they do not have that right is because there are a lot of people who they do not know if they find it offensive or not. The people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them. So, they just agreed to look past them and ignore what is there if it offends them for the people who do not find them offensive. Now, from my point of view from finding or seeing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., in a library that are or was offensive to me. There have been a couple of times where I have walked in a library where I found a couple of books that was offensive towards me. I really did not like what the books were all about and called, and I really would have liked to take them off the shelves and throw them away so no other person who might have found them offensive would find them or see them. So what if there are other people who would have actually wanted to read those books? That was what I thought about when I was tempted to actually remove them. So I decided not to remove the books from the shelves, so the people who did not find them offensive could read them, if they wanted to. I respected the fact that there are other people that are out there that would want to read those books but at the same time, I knew that there are people who could find them offensive but I just thought that they would just ignore the fact that they are there. So, on to the last thing that I am going to talk about. Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves, at a library, if they are found offensive? Also my views on censorship in libraries. Well I do believe that they should be removed so they would not be offending anyone that walked into that library. But, if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive towards them, then there would literally be no books left in the libraries. Then there would not be any point in having libraries or in anyone writing books. So then again, I do not believe that any person should have a right to just remove the books that are offensive to them at all. I believe that if they find a book that is offensive to them, then they should just ignore that it is there and respect that there are a lot of people out there who would want to or like to read those books. So I do not believe that there should be any censorship in libraries at all. It is not anyone's fault that people find books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive to them. So no, there should absolutely not be any censorship in a library. So there, I have just explained my views on censorship in libraries and if I believe that people should have the right to remove books from a shelf just cause they found it offensive. Like I have stated before, there should not be any censorship in libraries at all. But yes, I do understand that people find things that are offensive, but they should just ignore that they are there and respect that there are people who want to or would like to read those books. Once again, do you believe that people should have the right to remove a book from a shelf just cause they found it offensive, and what are your views on censorship in libraries? I know my own position is firmly against it.
230	3207	2	3	Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive? Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of view, or to perhaps state an opinion, of which everyone has a different point of view. No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated G through R, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisory sticker, so just follow the ratings. If a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated R movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet of age. People might bring the point of maybe a child picks up an adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it. The solution to that problem is simple: create a separate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section. Have cameras near by so if a youngster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an I.D. for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a person's dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied their dream because a person deems it unfit. And most apparent if it offends you don't read it. Simply follow the rating rules. Take necessary precautions. If all of these rules are followed then businesses and libraries should have no problems keeping everybody safe and happy with the available materials.
231	3208	2	3	If I could remove anything from the shelves of libraries, I wouldn't. Would you rather your kids learn things from factual sources or learn from friends and hearsay? Censoring books, magazines, movies, and other materials that go onto the shelves, which are mostly for enjoyment or informational purposes, is a problematic practice. Granted, you wouldn't want a five-year-old reading a book made for adults, but with age, kids would have to learn about complex topics. You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere, including college and on into their adult life. Books provide facts and more reliable information than what you can hear from people on the street. If all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a factual report on those things? The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share, and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and general knowledge. If someone were to find a book or a magazine offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up; they can simply choose another. Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes, and something you might find offensive isn't necessarily offensive to others. Taking a single book from the shelves would set a precedent, resulting in others taking books off the shelves, and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves. If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy and their brain wouldn't function correctly from a lack of diverse thought. You'd be taking away one of their fundamental rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't. What kids read is crucial for shaping their minds for their future. If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they might not read or listen to music or anything anymore because it isn't enjoyable to them. Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to. So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another. Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere productive, someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them. In one way or another, every book provides valuable information for people.
232	3209	2	3	Hi, my name is @PERSON1, and I have a couple of topics that I would like to talk to you about. I have been hearing a lot of people talking about libraries taking a lot of their stuff off the shelves. Well, I think that the libraries around the world have a lot of information inside of them, and if we started taking that valuable information out of them, then what would be the point in having them at all? I think that everything in libraries is very important, and who is to know that everybody wants this removal to happen? The one thing that I don't really think that libraries need in them is movies, because pretty much every movie has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much. And let's get on with the whole offensive thing; I think everyone should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say, even if it is hurtful. Though I think that the more people read about what people are saying about them, the less that they are going to care because they are going to just be so used to it that they are not even going to know what they are talking about anymore. If there was one thing that I could tell the world, it would be don't be offended by what people say to you; just focus on the knowledge that libraries provide.
233	3210	2	3	You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, not all of them are responsible enough to handle certain materials. You could blabber in their ear all day about being responsible and doing their work, and they will go out and do what they want anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certain things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what truly matters in their teenage years. And that is schoolwork. If school systems allowed there to be offensive or inappropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well... 'distracted'. And when I say inappropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for the school environment. You would like to think that they would possibly save it for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do is a significant percentage of the time not schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals. School work is a very important thing in teenagers' lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and related activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do that at home. Offensive books should not be there to only distract the teenager from school. It's unnecessary. But with public libraries, it's a whole new story. I believe that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go there on their own free will. I know I personally go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. It's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because not only do teenagers go there, but adults do too. It is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what you're there for? The library is for people to go and read, whether it's just for the heck of it or for school. Not everyone is responsible. Especially not all teenagers. So that's why I personally believe offensive or inappropriate materials should not be allowed in school libraries, but allowed in public libraries. Although equal rights and freedom is necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from it. It is the key to their future.
234	3211	2	3	All people have the same right to read, listen, and watch different materials. To be censored should be no one's choice but your own. For someone else to tell you what and what not to read is, by my opinion, very wrong to do. If we would censor everything we did, we would have a city and a nation that would progress very slowly. Any given word can offend any certain person. The people that they offend are, in my opinion, the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully expressing ourselves; the colorful words that we sometimes use can be offensive to one person yet perfectly fine to another. It all depends on the individual that likes or dislikes the word or readings. In my observations of people reading and disliking it because of its harsh and colorful words, it is most often people that do not fully express themselves and are yet much more sensitive. I think this also goes against freedom of speech. We were given that right, so why wouldn't we use it? Why wouldn't people want us to express ourselves? I have no idea why any person would want to take books, music, movies, and magazines away from us. If everything went by one man's rule of what to and not to read, we would downgrade as a country and stagnate. Therefore, I strongly advise not to take any books off the shelves. The majority of the people agree with me to not be censored, and only the sensitive people that are offended will just make their own choice not to pick the book off the shelf, not to listen to the music, and not to pick up the magazine. The right is ours, and that's how it should stay.
235	3212	2	3	Censorship. It's a word that everyone has heard, but do people truly know what it means or how it affects them? In the past, books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful. How could they say that they knew what was best for their people? What gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read? In today's society, we still have to deal with censorship issues. There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books. Censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well. No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another. Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to. Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read. Some people like mysteries, while others like to read romantic books. If we allow people to censor what we read, then how can we say that there is a book for everyone to like? If libraries censored every book that might offend someone else, then there would not be any books left for anyone to read. For example, certain religious books might offend people of other religions, but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves. If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended. Then no one would be able to find books about their religion, and no one would benefit from that loss. Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world. Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate. If we only focus on the person who hates it and get rid of movies based on the people who hate them, then the people who love the movies will suffer for it. People who love horror movies probably hate comedies. This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because there are some people who dislike them. It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them; the choice is theirs. In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love. We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like. If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music. It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music. It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody, which is an impossible standard. People would be even more offended than before in that case. There will always be unhappy people in the world. We should not resort to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try to make a few people happy. Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy. It makes the people who would like the items that have been censored mad. We should not resort to that. We should allow people to pick what they like. If a person wants to read something, they should be allowed. If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them? The slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it themselves. We can't take something away from the people who love it just because someone else is unhappy with its content.
236	3213	2	3	I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily overlook them and not read them, choosing instead materials that align with their personal values. Some people think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed towards them personally. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for in some contexts. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine, creating a personal and public conflict. Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that children won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from, providing crucial understanding. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say, leading to confusion rather than protection. Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs for research or personal growth. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they may never find it, losing that opportunity forever. Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading alone. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because that's your friend's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why, creating curiosity. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested, demonstrating that openness often reduces intrigue. You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things they are questioning. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life by making informed choices. So why not take the risk? It could even help you understand their perspective better.
237	3214	2	3	Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening more than ever before. We now are able to tap into the huge amount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in countries where media is considered treason. What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Lets start by looking an argument that has been long talked about: library censorship. Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities, serving as community hubs. Public libraries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the direct purview of federal mandates. Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinite sources of knowledge and culture. One public library can be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn from shared resources. Libraries today often carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries currently. Libraries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhere by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepancies throughout different regions in banning books. As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libraries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to cling onto the senior generation to stay alive and relevant. Bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. One major controversy of books in public libraries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as popular artists, we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. The authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encounters. I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, disease prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public library. Public libraries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? Even as a commercial business, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. So why is there a question on including new knowledge? Isn't it obvious that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past. That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will receive the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world, prepared for a diverse global society.
238	3215	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, should be removed off of the shelves if they are offensive? My personal opinion is that they should not be removed unless they are so inappropriate that children should not be able to see them at all. That is my opinion because if readers go into the library and find an offensive book to us might not be offensive to him/her and his/her standards, as everyone has a different threshold for what they find acceptable. And if it is offensive to him/her so what he/she is the one checking it out so he/she obviously knows what he/she is getting in to so there for we should not remove books off the shelves if they are offensive, because offensive to one is not offensive to the other, and personal choice is key. well actually my opinion goes half and half because if the movies and library materials are inappropriate then adults should be the only ones to buy them or have access, creating a simple division. That is my personal opinion many others have different opinions on this subject but I just think every thing should just stay on the shelves for people to discover for themselves. And movies sold to adults and adults only, allowing for personal responsibility to guide consumption rather than broad censorship.
239	3216	2	3	Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the opportunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time. When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to, as their maturity allows for different content. Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library, maintaining a balance. Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world, providing a private escape. Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books, so the exposure is limited. If someone wanted to read a book that was inappropriate for their children, let them do it; it's not hurting the children that they have been reading inappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place, out of easy reach. For example, a parent read the book which had some inappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous. That parent will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children; this scenario is how it should be, with clear sections. Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section, ensuring a safe space. Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner due to their audible and visual nature. Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around and could be exposed. Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall, making control difficult. Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a device is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in? The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away, causing accidental exposure. The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library as a safe haven. Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children's areas. As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds, prioritizing their well-being. Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain and sense of security.
240	3217	2	3	Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library. The criticizing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and mistreated from the harsh people that think they are offensive. In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries, as it is a shared public resource. The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows interest in the materials for people all over the world with diverse tastes. The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage. It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This highlights how everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have, which is natural. This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it, based on personal interpretation. However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, sees something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well, showing the subjectivity of offense. To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focus more on my argument. There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people, addressing historical struggles. It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else, a difficult topic. In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this, with varied reactions. Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now and understanding the progress made. On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equality up in the present world, or even the future, preferring to move forward. Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it, finding it painful. Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others, based on demand. When people think of materials, they most likely think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself, carrying meaning. This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries, as symbols can provoke strong feelings. The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library, offering connection. However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material, imposing their view. This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to receive, limiting access. Another argument people might have is that libraries are a public place, right? Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies, as public funding brings public debate. People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out, feeling empowered. Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well, showing the dynamic nature of collections. Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and
241	3218	2	3	I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what may be offensive to one person may not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it might be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history. What might be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that could be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left. A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring. People said that Hitler was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? This is why I believe we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves, as they serve as crucial reminders and learning tools for society.
242	3219	2	3	I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive. First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines. The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music. Second, what may seem 'offensive' to one person may be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case. There is no need for an angry public or strikes. Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to. After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning. So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from their shelves that are found offensive. First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library. For example, one person might like to read philosophical books, and the other might like to read romance comedy books. If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read. Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading Plato's book, or Aristotle's Republic. I had an experience similar to this with my friend. She preferred horror movies, and I historical. The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city. My friend was not happy. The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public. Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings. What may seem 'offensive' to one person may not seem offensive to another. An example: a Surfing magazine cover may be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child. However, that same cover may be interesting to a young adult because he might be into surfing, suntanning, or beaches. Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used. So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so. The solution is for the child to look at Ranger Rick Magazines, children's books, or Highlights magazines. The library should provide a section for young readers so that they can read appropriate material. Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to. They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music. They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities. After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment. The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive. This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', and for the sake of human flourishment. Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place. They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education.
243	3220	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book. I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Liking a book is an opinion. For example, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so there should be different books. When you don't like a book I believe the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community. I read an article about banning 'The Catcher in the Rye' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. 'The Catcher in the Rye' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. It's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf? This is why individual taste should not dictate public access.
244	3221	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I do not believe that. Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values. I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back, or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene. There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away. You just don't listen to it or you don't read it. If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you, then go right ahead. It's good to defend yourself. I remember when I was about twelve, I went to a hotel in Florida with my family and a family friend. And the guy my dad invited to come was John. He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometime gets out of hand with his comments on the racist names, but we tolerate him. So we go to check in at the hotel and the check in/ check out person at the counter was a black woman. We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for John to step up and ask for a room. My father asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter. John looks at us and smiles, then he pulls out a pamphlet from his shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter. Now I have no idea what the pamphlet said or what kind of pictures was on it, but when he handed it to her she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man. As this rather large man walks around the counter towards John my father steps in the picture. My dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice my dad because he was so focused on John. John says, 'Now look I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' My mom takes me and my brothers up to our room and tries to get my father to come with us instead he promises us he'll be right up. A good half an hour later my dad comes through the door with John close behind. I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and my father says it was an aids pamphlet he got from a rest stop. I looked at John and I said, 'Why'd you give that to her?' His reply was well because a lot of people have aids but it's kind of an inside joke about 'blacks' and aids. So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to my father. My dad said the reason why she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago. Which of course John never knew about all that. But I'm sure he learned his lesson. He should have just left her alone. So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us. We stayed there all weekend. Of course her and John exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that, and she moved on with her life. I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone else don't like it, as individual interactions and sensitivities are too varied to govern a public collection.
245	3222	2	3	Do I think materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the book shelve if they found offensive? Yes I do because why keep it on there if it's offensive to young kids and other people. If it doesn't have nothing do with learning then it shouldn't be on there. Its certain things kids should read so if they want to put materials that are made for adults then they should put it in a separate section from the kids section. They shouldn't have any music or movies that have some type of violence in it because the kids now days have too much violence as it is. The only way they should put music or movies on there is if they have learning materials in it. So I think you should put books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelve only if they contain learning materials and things that would persuade them to do something in their life, ensuring a positive and educational environment for all patrons, especially the young ones.
246	3223	2	3	There are different types of books, movies, magazines, and tape recorders in libraries. Books can be fiction or nonfiction, covering a vast range of human knowledge and imagination. However, books or any other items can be offensive to some people, but to others, they are just a book to read or a source to consult. So therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf. Who picks out the books, movies, magazines, and tape recorders? The answer is the customers at the library, who have the right to choose what they wish to engage with. The authors of the books or items did not force their work upon anyone. The authors gave the decision to choose between books or items to the individual patron. No one can blame the authors for creating their work. Also, there are different kinds and different types of writers or artists, each with their own unique perspective and style. Writers and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear, investing significant effort and creativity. People should not take it too seriously about books or other sources because they can be nonfiction or fiction, and their purpose is to inform, entertain, or provoke thought. My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offend someone but not others. For example, a topic like slavery can offend a colored person due to its painful history, but to others, it is just a historical event to be studied. People need to know what happened in the past with historical events to understand the present. People need to read the introduction or summary before checking out the book to know if they like it or not, exercising personal judgment. Therefore, people should not try to remove it from general access. If a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents' responsibility. It is their fault because parents let their child check the items out and should guide their choices. Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then they can complain, but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf based on a single complaint. Like I said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it and find value in it. Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other sources off the shelves based on individual sensibilities, as their role is to provide access to a broad collection for the entire community.
247	3224	2	3	Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on censorship at the library. When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happens when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects children and young adults from viewing things that are for adult eyes only, such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography. Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have an adults only section for books, movies, music etc., it stops a lot of people from having to worry about their kids seeing bad things. For instance, if a twelve year old child goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it, he can check it out and play the game without his parents knowledge of the incident. With censorship we eliminate such problems by having age restrictions and designated sections. Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, it's the parents fault for why their kids do things, also like letting their kids listen to music with heavy swearing or giving them full access to a personal computer without supervision. Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people should not censor important information on the account of an event that has happened in the past. Another example, if you're in ninth grade and you enter a library for a documentary movie but it's too graphic, the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer to find alternative materials. Now that you have my opinions and beliefs you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well if applied too broadly. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is at times out of control but if maintained properly, we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country. In essence, censorship is ok to an extent and you should believe this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see regarding its careful and limited application.
248	3225	2	3	Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me personally. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us or why certain topics are sensitive. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that might be found offensive in some way should be removed from the shelves. If you think about it, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings depending on your personal experiences and beliefs. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people might not be found offensive by another person or group of people with a different background. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left, and the library would be empty. Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else. Some authors may do this in a very offensive manner to make a point or challenge conventions. Others may try to sugar-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea to be more palatable. Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive if you look hard enough or interpret it a certain way. In conclusion, I feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left for people to learn from and enjoy, which defeats the purpose of a library.
249	3226	2	3	Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere in modern society. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way, often through friends or the internet. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they might need to be reviewed, though not necessarily removed. Take music for example, there might be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it anyway, making removal ineffective. Movies may be different in their visual impact. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material, which is a reasonable precaution. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was, which is contradictory. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it and appreciate it. Books may be the only exception some people consider. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive due to the ideas they contain. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real; it's just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about, which can feel more persuasive. which is why some books might be considered for removal from shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else, though this is a risk with any media. There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something at all. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it, like ratings or labels, and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision and your responsibility, not the library's role to remove it.
250	3227	2	3	Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Libraries now days have a lot of offensive language in their books, so if someone were to take all of the books like that out of the library then the library wouldn't even have that many books in it, severely limiting its collection. Music is the same way; all music now days might have some offensive words in them, that's just something people now days have to get over or choose to ignore. I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parents might not like the idea of their libraries having offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines, which is understandable. If the parents don't want their children to read those books then they need to choose their children's books for them, but I think taking all the offensive books off the shelves isn't very smart or practical. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music and find value in it. Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in them like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that path going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and you weren't able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things out of ignorance. They really wouldn't know the side effects and bad things that could come out of those things without being exposed to the consequences in a narrative. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in them and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice words in them? I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life that is invaluable. If there are books you don't want yourself to read then don't read them; it is a matter of personal choice. I think it would be unfair to take everything that has some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. Its not fair to people who might enjoy those books to not have the luxury to read those books anymore cause a few parents got mad about a book's content. Some of the old books have a lot of racism in them, and you actually might read some of them in a school for a class to understand historical context. Those books might also have bad language in them too, reflecting the time they were written. Taking those books away from us would take away our education, and we wouldn't be able to learn from those books like we should about past mistakes and societal progress. So I think that censorship in library is just a horrible idea. It can take away from lessons we could learn and our education that we need to be successful in life and to understand the complex world we live in.
251	3228	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic. Many people believe that it is the right thing to do while many others strongly disagree with it. Censorship should not occur in libraries for several reasons. All people have freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1 and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right. Authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public. Censorship is acceptable in some circumstances but what is censored should not be decided by the government. First of all, freedom of speech is very important to the people of the @LOCATION1. If this freedom were to be taken away, it would definitely not go unnoticed. When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished. For example, what if an atheist wrote a book saying that @CAPS1 wasn't real? Many @CAPS2 would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries. Just because one group of people do not like the topic, message, or theme of a book does not mean that it should be taken out of a library. A library is a place where all books have a chance to be read not a place where people get to pick and choose what they want there because of their beliefs. Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowledged by the public. Of course there will be books that are more popular than others, but at the same time there will also be books that are neglected not because the quality of the writing but because of the topic the author chose to write about. There is no reason to have a whole community ignore an author's work just because a large group of people do not agree with what it says. In that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book. Just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them. The author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged. Last of all, censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances. It just depends in what ways censoring is used. For example, many parents do not want their children reading, listening or watching certain things. The parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read, listen, or watch, not a large group of people. Many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children @MONTH1 appall others. So, there could never be a set standard for what is acceptable and not acceptable without creating a large amount of controversy. Once that child becomes an adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library. There should be certain limits though. For example, a person must be the age of seventeen or older to rent a '@CAPS3' rated movie. This is the same age a person must be to get into a '@CAPS3' rated movie without parental supervision. Some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries, but other than that, the decisions should be left up to the person. Censorship in libraries will always be changing. Sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not. People of the @LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right. The author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves. Censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them. Parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others, ensuring that personal freedom and responsibility are maintained.
252	3229	2	3	Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it banned from all local stores? Well I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the sheer distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book. I personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to. The fact that a book is found offensive or offputting to most is no reason to completely ban the book from store and library shelves alike, because if there is @CAPS5 one person that could educationally benefit from reading this book then they should at least have a chance to obtain that information. One of the most important things to remember while considering this topic is that no matter what the source is or what it conveys there will always be someone that feels the book is just too graphic or hits too close to home for them to stand. In other cases however, there are books that are not proper for younger children or the faint of heart, such as the book series 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which people are thrown into an arena and forced to fight each other for their very lives. Most people who are above the age of twelve can handle almost all of the 'offensive sources' that are attainable by the public, but there are some cases that @CAPS5 adults cannot handle such as the famous book that @PERSON1 wrote in incarceration called ' @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' @CAPS5 in those extreme cases most adults can still read them. Now that my argument has been said and you know my point of view is that it varies from person to person whether they can handle a book I ask you if you feel the same way that I do. My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book. We do live in @LOCATION1 the land of the free, I think we can handle a little controversy over a book or magazine. I do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive. I believe that we will see a day that no book will be banned from the shelves, so that our children @MONTH1 gain the knowledge that is contained by those fragile pages of paper, fostering a more informed and open-minded generation.
253	3230	2	3	I think that all of the books and movies and more should not be censored because people have a right to know what they want to know or see. They need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that @CAPS1 war @NUM1 won't happen again. The libraries are for freedom to read and to do what you want and look up information. In the newspaper and magazines people like to know what happens in the @CAPS1 or to people if its bad or not, because then they know how that can't happen to them. Some people might think that people should not read or watch something but are they to tell others what to do? They can make their own decisions about what they choose to consume. Ultimately, access to information allows individuals to learn and grow from a wide array of perspectives and experiences.
254	3231	2	3	I can think of several books that I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. As soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because she knew that this was only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl. That's all she wanted out of life. She would sit and thought is that just a little too much to ask for. After a few years had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for her father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind. Her mother always pumped in her head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But she went on the hunt for her father by faith in the lord. After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that she just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the answers that she needed to solve her heartache and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world her father would be waiting for her. It was just before the sun was beginning to set, when she noticed a little old southern bell sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead, with tears filled in her eyes. Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with a lump in her throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow. She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sat and talked with her father. Her father told her that he had wrote her a letter everyday. That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that she had never received a letter from him in her entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail. After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughter's life because the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going against law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because she was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother. The reason I choose this book was because when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tough. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in your heart. Sometimes the bleed still seemed to find its way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because she took the blame for her father walking out of her life. Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentage of single parent families now days than before. Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parent not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through. Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child? All these children want is to know they're loved and that someone cares about them. If you're going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parents to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's totally fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, rather than going through these feelings alone, but for younger readers, a parent's guidance is essential to protect their emotional well-being.
255	3232	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading. I do believe that if it's a book you are not supposed to get, if it's not for your age group, don't get it. Some libraries contain books that are highly not appropriate for children; they have sections for adults and children to check out books. Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books. The library is a place with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book. When I first went to the library for the first time I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian showed me my section by showing me my age group. By then I was checking out books that were appropriate for my age. Magazines I didn't care too much about; I just wanted to read a whole book from beginning to end, and having that guidance helped me find stories I enjoyed without encountering material I wasn't ready for. In conclusion, whenever you need a good book, check out your section and make sure the book is appropriate for you and feed your mind with knowledge, ensuring a positive and enriching experience at the library for readers of all ages.
256	3233	2	3	Censorship In a library there are a plethora of books to choose from. Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones. It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read. Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available. If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it, creating a chain reaction of suppression. I believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people. Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money. If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also, and other libraries won't buy it, effectively silencing the author's voice. Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people. Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn and limits the diversity of ideas available to the public. Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed. It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive. The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also. Since censorship is probably mostly opinion, there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't, making the process inherently subjective and unstable. With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on, this might mean we need new publishers, or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world, a goal that censorship directly opposes. The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question, leading to a slippery slope of ever-increasing restrictions. Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library, a practice that ultimately harms intellectual freedom.
257	3234	2	3	A library is a place to go when inneed of solitude and peace with researching or reading. There is no reason other than someones opion to why certain materails should be removed from libraries. We the people have a right to read what others have composed thourgh their thoughts and ideas, a fundamental principle of a free society. Certain materail may be offensive to different people, but to the others that could use that materail for research or for pleasure reading, would not be fair. If certain materials were removed because of someones action to there personal or religious opion, then those materials would nopt be avalible for those that would need to posess that information, effectively privileging one viewpoint over all others. Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive materail to be removed? If people did they would relize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that infomation out to the world. How do you think that author would feel? You just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive. How would you feel if some to your best peice of writing and complained that libraries cannot put this on their shelfs because its offensive, dismissing your hard work and creative expression? There has been certain matierals I have listen to or read tht I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that writes the society as we read it. Some of those people may have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things. Maybe not even watch certain materials but others, that might be there part of livlyhood and essential to their understanding of the world. We can't just take materials off the shelfs of libraries. That material is the life blood of our society, circulating ideas and knowledge. If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that, such as intellectual stagnation and cultural decline. For whoever reads this, remember what we produces as media is who we are, what we do , and what we live for, and to censor it is to censor a part of ourselves.
258	3235	2	3	Why Censorship Is Bad? In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense. Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there. Everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen. We just have to teach our kids what is good and what is bad. This goes for literary items too. We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what is right. I think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive. I think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries. Now days, there is a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books. If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself. The people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece. They spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea. I think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there is a person that put a lot of effort into that material, and their labor deserves to be seen. In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it. The Da Vinci Code is a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says Jesus had a wife and had children. This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it is just a story full of conspiracy theories. You can still believe what you want and read this book. A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title is White Men Can't Jump. Many people hear this title and may not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against white people, but instead it is a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball. Many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories. They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe. In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things. In our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want. Even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this. If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book. Even though it is disrcimanting against me, I could still love the book. There is always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it. Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday and finding value in them? Like Katherine Paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else. If we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left. We cannot control everything that people do. Taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading. If they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all. I think that censorship in our libraries would be a bad idea, and I think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries, as it would impoverish our cultural landscape.
259	3236	2	3	Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic information about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this information and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad information. There is only people who are not yet ready for the information they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines, and movies be censored? That answer is yes. First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the information given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become, hindering their healthy development. Secondly, information presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed, a clear consequence of premature exposure. Lastly, premature information can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics, creating potentially damaging internal imagery. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked from vulnerable audiences. In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that may be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world, and we must protect their innocence while they grow.
260	3237	2	3	No I do not belive that certain materials should be removed. I belive that people should be able to have freedom of speech, a cornerstone of our democratic society. I also belive that if somebody has something on their mind they should should be able to say it, to share their perspective and contribute to public discourse. I all ways tell peolple to mean what you say and say whay you mean, emphasizing honesty and personal responsibility in communication. Now if its younger kids getting ahold of magazines and movies with inpropriate material in it then yes it should be censored or they shouldn't be placed in places with younger kids can get to them, as the primary concern should be age-appropriate access rather than wholesale removal. This balanced approach respects both freedom of expression and the need to protect children.
261	3238	2	3	I honestly don't think anything offensive should be removed from libraries, primarily because children don't really know what those offensive things mean. The library is the only good place to find reliable information or to find a book that they genuinely enjoy. If you start taking things out that seem offensive to some people, then people are going to have a hard time finding any facts or anything they neeed for their education or personal growth. People use offensive language or discuss offensive topics all the time, but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way. The library itself doesn't intentionally insult people; the library just gives us facts and historical context about what we need to know about a person or any event. Some people simply don't know how to be mature when it comes to things like that, and if they cant be mature about stuff like that then they don't need to be in the library, which is a place for learning. I would understand if the intentions were to insult someone, but their not, so why should the magazines, movies, books, and music be taken out of the library? Thats just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information. Slavery, for instance, is an offensive thing to colored people, cause the colored people get called names that i will not say in this essay. Most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past and understand its context. Honestly I think people will be ok; they dont need to get all bent out of shape because they see something offensive they just need to know that it wasnt intentionaly done to cause harm.
262	3239	2	3	I strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out of the library. It is not okay for you to say one thing and then have something your child found in the library say the complete opposite is okay. For example, what if you were talking to your kids about not smoking and how it is bad for them and could potentially kill them, would you like your child to say that they can smoke because all the characters in the book are smoking? No, that is not right; it is just pure wrong. They shouldn't allow those kinds of books, music, movies, or magazine in the library, as they send mixed messages. In high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke or do drugs or anything like that. Sometimes it might be hard for a teenager to believe the things your parents talked to you about and how harmful they are to you and your body and how they would lead you to a troubled life down the road. Movies we watch today often talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how characters had fun driving a stolen car. It is wrong to talk about them that way because it gets teens to think it is okay for them to do it and that nothing bad is going to happen as a consequence. The media does a bad job of showing teens it is not right to do the things they see on tv. The library sets a bad example by allowing those kinds of books to sit on the shelves and thinks it is okay for people to read them and not take it offensive. I was once reading a book that was talking about how the characters think it is okay to act rascist aganist other people and say mean thing and call them bad name. I really took that offensive because i wouldnt like someone calling me name and saying bad things about me because they think it okay to say things like that and act that way. If books say all those things and the readers actually believe them, then we might have a problem in our hands because some people would take offensive to it and cause a big issue over a small book, and some readers might think its okay and cause an even bigger issue between people who take it offensive and people who dont take it offensive. There are those people out there who think that it is okay for those kind of books to be in the library and other people who think it is wrong and offensive. My personal view is that i think it is wrong to have those kind of books at the library. We tell people how it is wrong to do bad things and how we hate certain things that are offensive to us, but then a book says that it is alright for those thing to be happening or that it is right to use that foul language. I just think it is personally wrong to say that those kind of things in movies, music, books, or magazines are okay to be in the library, yet alone in the people it self.
263	3240	2	3	What do I think about all of this? To me, I really don't care because that is just like who I am. And it is up to the parents if they want the library to remove the books off the shelf if they believe that a certain material, such as a book, music, movies, and magazing, should be remove off the shelves. Also, I dont think a book will ever really hurt anyone in a physical sense. I mean, its just a book; it dose not really matter in the grand scheme of things. Next, I am saying this becuse I dont really get offensive to stuff like this argument. And also, if there is some stuff that kids shouldnt know about, then they should simply put those stuff in the adult section and not a place where they can find it easy. They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids section where it is easily accessible. Matter of fats, I don't know why they should remove stuff like movie from the library entirely. Becuse if they are trying to block them form kids to see, they are really dumb to do that by removing them for everyone. Beause there are moive that children can watch that are perfectly fine. And some parents is not going to let their children watch a @CAPS1 @NUM1 movies, and other movie they were not supposed to see at there ages unless if their parents allowe it. And that goes with the same with the music available. I don't know if they have bad music in the library; I don't see rap stuff in the library, like raps @CAPS2 and other stuff like it. So this is my complete thought about this arguments.
264	3241	2	3	Yes, I think they should take offensive books off the shelf because little kids read the books and then they will probably be taught wrong from right based on the content. If the books contain inappropriate material, children might not understand the context and could be influenced negatively. And if the books had vilance depicted in them, then they will thinck that is right to behave in that manner, which is a dangerous lesson to learn. It is important to protect young minds from content that glorifies harmful actions, as they are still developing their understanding of the world and their moral compass. Therefore, removing such materials is a necessary step to ensure they learn positive values.
265	3242	2	3	Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media and where the line should be drawn. I believe censorship is wrong because it violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want, as long as it does not directly incite violence. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway, as this is a form of control. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts and artistic expression. Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate to someone else? No, we should not. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media forms. If a person does not like what they see or hear, then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress the original creator. They should write back, convey their counter-message and try to win support through debate, not through control and removal. Censorship is not good for any society that values freedom. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to do so. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger; it is only a fuel that adds to the fire of conflict. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it, then do not take it from everyone; instead, they should tell them how it is 'wrong' from their perspective and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 can descide what they believe in on their own as they grow. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities who seek to control the flow of information.
266	3243	2	3	Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very vulgar and inappropriate article? Were you disappointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf simply thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored. People all over the world are vastly different. From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is exactly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music? Some individuals enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while others may prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book. The same thing occurs in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library. Many people say yes, people have their right to choose what they do or do not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is portrayed then don't pick it up.' Others say no, 'The library is supposed to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion. As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you might think that censored items are ok in libraries. If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child. Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of losing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad. In my personal experience, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to borrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholarly and comprehends things quickly. Furthermore when she found a book that she thought would be interesting. The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe environment? To me it is ridiculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials. If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them. Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed. When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negatively influenced by it. Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential. Therefore in the end books should be censored!
267	3244	2	3	Some books are not suitable for kids. They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These books should not be allowed to be checked out by kids under the age of eighteen unless their parent or guardian allows them to. Some adults don't care what their kids read but the library should. I've read books at school that were adult books at school. Back in elementary school, I remember checking out a lot of books but I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books. It helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them. Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material. I believe that this should take place at every library around the world to protect young minds while still providing access for adults.
268	3245	2	3	I think as long as the book isn't offensive or bad then people should keep reading it. If it's offensive I think they shouldn't read it at all cause it would not be right to read such a thing. Also I think if there is bad music it should be taken off the shelves. Parents or teachers wouldn't want their kids finding out bad words to say. It is important to protect children from harmful content so they can grow up in a positive and healthy environment, which is why such materials should be restricted.
269	3246	2	3	I do indeed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornographic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things. I personally have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted. I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. Paul in the Bible says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it. This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornographic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the grocery store check out line I see the people magazines and I find it very offensive! I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it intolerable to post these materials where viewers who do not want to see them have to see them. A little consideration for others can create a much more comfortable public space for everyone.
270	3247	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive? I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something that's true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner. The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that there's just too many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be original and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel a lot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they don't have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day. Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabbed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talking about magazines, music and movies. Well to be honest I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you feel that your not alone. Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book. So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are. Does it drive us crazy that they do? No it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us away out from our daily stressful lives and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn a lot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much. I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books shouldn't be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are a lot a lot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime. That's the end of my conclusion.
271	3248	2	3	"No, I don't think books are offensive in libraries. Movies, however, are a different kind of story. If your child is under the age of eighteen, they should not be renting a rated @CAPS1 movie unless their parent approves of it. This is one primary reason why our public library should not have rated @CAPS1 movies. While I was in our public library one afternoon, I was looking at the movie selection, trying to decide which one to choose. There was a little boy, about nine or ten years old it looked like to me, and he had two movies in his hand. They looked really good; they were action type movies. So I asked the boy if I could see the movie really fast. He said yes, so I grabbed it from him and looked at the rating because from the title picture it looked gory. I noticed it was a rated @CAPS1 movie, and I told the boy, ""Did you know this is a rated @CAPS1 movie?"" and he said yes. I was surprised his parents would let him watch movies like that; if I was his age, I would never have been able to.  My second reason is why our public library should get rid of any kind of swimsuit magazines like @CAPS5 and/or @CAPS6 magazines. I was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like @CAPS5, swimsuit magazines, and many more. Do you think your children should see any kind of magazines like that in our library, displayed for the public to see? If a little girl went to the magazine rack and saw that magazine, she would either want to look at it or act like she didn't even notice it. At her age, she wants someone to look up to, and if she sees a model on or in the magazine, she would want to possibly look like her. This is how eating disorders can start. This is the reason why libraries should get rid of any kind of magazines under that category. These are the reasons why I think our local library should get rid of rated @CAPS1 movies and magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. If you agree with me, contact your library and tell them what I have told you today. @MONTH1 we can put a stop to this concerning content in our libraries."
272	3249	2	3	There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books. This is called censorship. However, @CAPS3 you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library. @CAPS3 would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are too horrific or too adult-like for their own good? This is the question that plagues them every year with new shipments of books. Although yes, that seems terrifying, it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons: the congressional law allowing us to have freedom of the press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve.  First of the arguments that can be held is the freedom of the press. This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today. If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children, then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations. Children @MONTH1 read it, yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author. If so, then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves. It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer. When it comes to the arguments of @CAPS3 to do on censorship, the freedom of thought pops into most minds. This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think @CAPS3 they will of anything. Just as with the freedom of the press, an individual can pick up that book for adults and read it, no matter the age they are. If they are discouraged by it, then by all means let them put it down; however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in children's novels, let them continue learning.  A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember. This is not scientifically proven, but when you are around children constantly, you notice this. Just as a baby's mind is a sponge, it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years. When they are allowed to read any book and not sit in front of a television screen all day, they learn more. Now someone can come along and say: '@CAPS3 if the book is a fantasy?'. It's no different. The storyline is not @CAPS3 teaches them; it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge. An educated man can sometimes get tongue-tied with words, whereas someone who did not do well in school or college but read quite a bit is able to use words with great ease. It is not always the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events?  All in all, it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public. There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap. Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someone's ability to learn a new word or grammatical law. If one parent could pull a book off a shelf, then another could do it, and soon you would not have any books. It would be a scary day if that happened, for it would not be something that went well in our history. Since humankind has had writing, we became more intelligent; taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings. So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them, not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but because the two congressional laws say it should be.
273	3250	2	3	Some books in libraries offend some people. But other people want to read these books. No single person has the right to say this book offended me so the libraries should remove it. If some book offends some person, that doesn't mean all the people will be offended by this book. My opinion is they should not remove this book, because some people like to read that book. If someone doesn't like this book and this book offended them, they should not read this book and read what they like instead. But they shouldn't say it should be removed. I think everyone likes different books. So libraries should have everything that people like to read, making a wide selection available for everyone's different tastes and interests.
274	3251	2	3	If everyone in the world could permanently take a book, movie, music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive, would there be any of those things left for us to enjoy? I personally think that if people could do that, they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanently so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of their own opinion of it.  If anyone could do that, would there ever be uniqueness in people? I don't think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus it shouldn't be taken away from that person if he or she enjoys listening to it. On the other hand, I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that have offensive language and that they would not want their children hearing or reading that, but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language; what should we do then? You can't just take that person out of the world.  So I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that just because you think it's offensive and don't like it doesn't mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my article, I want you to think about how what's offensive to you @MONTH1 not be the same for others, and we must respect that diversity in our shared public spaces.
275	3252	2	3	The contents of the books in libraries vary in many ways. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender, which should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel, magazines, music, or movies. A library is supposed to be for anyone that enjoys reading a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book, song, or movie.  In the library in our little town, they split up the variations of the reading materials, music, and movies. There is a children's section that has all the books we all grew up with in half the building. Also, an adult section for larger novels and topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would not want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest. With the ideas that people are writing about today, we cannot possibly control what comes to their mind. Some of the greatest books that are out probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefer to listen to. But that is what is so great: people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even @CAPS1 that they like.  When freedom of what you read is taken away, readers will stop reading. Doesn't the administration of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read, doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also, doesn't that mean the test scores will go down? In my experience, topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like, but the fact of it is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well liked, even with words or contents that some find objectionable, is not fair to the readers. I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc., because that would mean the libraries would be gone, and we would lose a vital resource for learning and enjoyment.
276	3253	2	3	If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes, believing it is their duty to protect others from harmful content. Others might not think anything of the item and simply move along without a second thought. I disagree with those who believe the item should be removed. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves for anyone who might seek it out. As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book, a place curated for my age group. I steered clear of the 'grown-up' area, knowing it was not intended for me. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it, guiding me toward more appropriate choices. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive, as parental guidance is the most effective filter. However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item from their own personal view, but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, television programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one person's narrow interests. This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries, to reflect the vast diversity of human thought and experience. If there is an offensive book or a bad magazine and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is their personal preference but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like or find valuable. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true, as difference and debate are what fuel progress and understanding. If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their music there if they find out someone keeps removing their work, stifling creativity and expression. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down, defeating the library's purpose as a repository of knowledge. I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect for their research or personal enjoyment. I believe that the book or magazine or CD should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it or learn from it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and simply walk away, practicing tolerance. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened, as it would no longer be a place of free inquiry. This is why I feel books should stay where there are, preserving access for all.
277	3254	2	3	Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The British government used it in the American colonies during the colonial period to keep the colonists loyal to the crown by suppressing rebellious ideas. The Nazis used censorship not just during the Second World War as a brand of propaganda, but also during their regime under Hitler's guidance to consolidate power and persecute minorities. Censorship is still in use in the United States today, often as a way to 'protect the children' from difficult truths. The Federal Communications Commission tells the American public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio, dictating standards. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy, imposing their moral framework on society. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the United States and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism by eroding personal freedoms. As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? It becomes a cycle of control. Where do we draw the line between protection and oppression? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate by someone, somewhere. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term, devoid of the creative spark that challenges us. I recently read a book titled 'The Kite Runner', by Khaled Hosseini, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal Afghanistan, and the life he had after his mother's death in the bustling capital of Kabul. Hosseini's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, dealing with brutal honesty and trauma, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished, lost to the world. Hosseini's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that Afghans face in the changing landscape of their nation, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort, a perspective I would have missed. All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives, limiting our horizons. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing for something I dislike? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life, such as preventing outright libel. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line between safety and an outright police state? Where's the boundary? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the First Amendment, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all American citizens in our Constitution. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, 'Give me liberty, or give me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all, but merely an illusion of freedom.
278	3255	2	3	If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material; simply choose something else. Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction and move on with your day. No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the library materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation, pouring their effort and vision into it. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way, with unique tastes and sensitivities. Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional? The offense is often a matter of personal interpretation, not malicious design. Each individual has their own opinion of each material, shaped by their life experiences. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard; it could even be inspiring. Others sometimes have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way and internalized it. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you; do not dwell on it. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion, but also do not impose your opinion on the available collection. The censorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you with diverse needs. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down; that is the simplest solution. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting or educational for their purposes. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong, engaging critically instead of seeking to erase. You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it in a world full of differing ideas. I go to the library once in a while, and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down, recognizing it is not for me. I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book; it was not a personal attack. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me? There is no need for outrage. I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that it represents someone else's opinion and not my own, and I can respect that difference. If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic, forming a reasoned response. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else when it comes to your personal choices. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of your life. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic if you are secure in your beliefs. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it, allowing for a plurality of perspectives to coexist peacefully.
279	3256	2	3	I myself beleves that censorship in libraries should not be aloud, as it restricts intellectual freedom. If their was to be any censorship it should be from the parents of a child, who know their child best, or if your not a child then you dont need censored because you can make your own choices. By censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on I think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens in the world, sheltering them from reality. Just because something isent censored doesnt mean it should be taken out of context eather; it should be engaged with thoughtfully. Think of it like this if you walking down a street its not going be censor; people will say bad words, show bad habits, and even go as far as seeing death or more, and life does not come with a filter. Being a kid who really never been censored from anything including books, ive learned alot about the world, both good and bad. But I feel as if I went to a librarie to get a book and if it was censored or taken off the shelf then I will be shown a fake world, a sanitized version that is not truthful. Once again if life cant be censored then we shouldnt censor anything else, especially not the materials meant to educate us about that life. A censored book, movie or whatever it may be could also determin how much someone could learn from it, as key facts or perspectives might be missing. People go to liraries to learn hard facts with proff and evadience and depending on the subject in witch their looking up, they need the complete picture, not an edited one. This is some of meny reasons I think censor in libraries shouldnt be aloud, as it does more harm than good. Censorship should be chosen by who you are and your own judgment, not by outher people imposing their standards on you. In the end we may never know whats better till we try experiencing the full, uncensored range of ideas and information available to us, allowing us to form our own educated opinions.
280	3257	2	3	No, I do not believe offensive material should be removed from libraries because the writer is explain the way the story really happend, providing an authentic narrative. If your kid ask you about the word, tell him/her it is not a good word to say, using it as a teaching moment, or you can take the book back and get him/her a new one that is more suitable. Say your kids comes home from school and say a course word and you asked him/her were they learned it from. And they said the teacher said it while reading a book aloud. You can tell the teacher you dont wanting your child reading that book, taking individual responsibility for your own child's exposure. Using course language is a way of explain the story better to them I guess, adding realism or conveying a character's nature, but it is ultimately the parent's role to guide their child's consumption of media, not the library's role to remove the material for everyone. Parents have the primary responsibility for monitoring what their children read and explaining challenging content, rather than demanding its removal and limiting access for others who may benefit from or appreciate the work in its entirety. This approach respects both parental authority and the principle of free access to information.
281	3258	2	3	Library: Good or bad? It is a very rare occasion that I go to the library; I'm a typical guy, I like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends. When I'm not in school I try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries. Those very rare occasions when I do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, I usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff I see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a good book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves. On the book shelves that I have walked by I have seen romance novels and they aren't as bad as I would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't inappropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre-teens shouldn't be reading them. So as long as there is separation between the kids section and adult section then I think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types of literature. Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way. Gossip magazines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines is a lot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative way about some people or some things. I think it's up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it I think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf. There are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and I feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and I just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug their parents all day about what they saw at the library. Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands. Nowadays, the cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so I feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way, they have ratings. If the librarian sees a five year old kid trying to check out a rated R movie then she should be fired, because there is clearly no reason why she would do that. Excuses can't come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now pornographic movies should not be in libraries at all, libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like having strippers in school, it is just not ethical. In conclusion I feel that censorship in libraries is a good thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in areas that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine.
282	3259	2	3	I don't see any reason why to take books off the shelves. If someone doesn't like a book, then they don't have to read it. Books are meant to entertain or inform people. There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know what was once thought and said. Libraries are out to make money, that's all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want. If I had a library I would sell just about anything I could. People will watch, listen, and read anything. So why not sell it or rent it out. It's an honest way of making money, providing what the public wants to consume.
283	3260	2	3	'Baby Got Back, Baby Got Back, Baby Got Back I like big butts and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' This song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While 'over a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closely at both lyrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song Baby Got Back is about a man that finds love in large gluteus maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere. To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing a penalty flag on the floor is just okay. Well it's not; banning books, music, etc. is just like censoring someone's imagination and creativity. It is just like the book 1984, where Big Brother is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past. Take Schindler's List for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during World War II and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remember the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been censored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hard times of the war and what it can do to a person's soul and emotions. A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was sixteen at the time, and I rushed through my iPod to find a song 'How to Save a Life' by The Fray. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of suicide away. While yes, there are songs & books like The Anarchist Cookbook and others that sometimes have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We still see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can save a life as much as it can take one away. Even then we can see that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get censored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved because it is an unreachable thing.
284	3261	2	3	The world today in the United States is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on. I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to whatever it may be that is considered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an R-rated movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be seventeen years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing. Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children for the most part don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only. These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you. There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent. If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion. In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is America, let's not be overly strict about things.
285	3262	2	3	How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen something that you think no other kid should see? I'm going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace. Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happens and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn? The books that children read varies. The younger kids won't know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read sometimes have words in it to display a serious part to the story, or a tragic moment in the characters life. Some stories sometimes even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it. Authors usually vary their vocabulary in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the 1800's why would they try and clean up the grammar that was spoken from that time. Try and change what the reader might think about that time. Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear something offensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in.
286	3263	2	3	Censorship of literature is a complex issue. As author Katherine Paterson wisely noted, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library. We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship. These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong.  Taking certain books off shelves would be against our constitution. The First Amendment gives all American citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they include a few controversial things we are violating their natural right. Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge?  So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? One person might think something is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is to far?  This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our whole lives would become one big judgement. Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inappropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward.  There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where others are coming from. If we can do that our world would be a much better place, fostering an environment of mutual respect and intellectual freedom for all.
287	3264	2	3	I believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned from their children, but not from the public. Everyone has their own belief in what he or she reads or writes or even watches, so the library is perfect the way it is. We can not throw out books we find offensive because of our beliefs because somebody else might want to come along and read about a certain religion or a certain topic. If we threw out all the books and made a library with only the books we wanted we'd be in a lot of debt because then we'd have to build libraries for everyone instead of one that allows us all to enjoy our favorite books all at the same place. A public library serves the entire community, not just one individual's preferences. So if we have a problem with a book or movie from the library we should just keep our children away from that item and inform them on why they should not be subjected to that item, thereby exercising personal responsibility without infringing on the rights of others.
288	3265	2	3	A very wise man in my life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' My father, while growing up had poor influences all around him. He went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a father, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As he grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. He had no example of how to behave, yet he stayed away from alcohol, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.  As I have been growing up with my father as a hard working individual and having my mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, my parents moved out of the old crime ridden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdemeanors. My father told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, foul language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what your kids are going to see, son.' He had a valid point. In our current days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talks about killing law enforcement officers.  What has the world come to when a child of age eight can walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and not have the book there at all.  Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel threatened or endangered. Well what if a parent feels threatened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resources should be controlled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD not have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inappropriate topic while in public but should know that that is not the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest assured that their child is safe from the filth of immoral things, creating a truly protected environment for young minds.
289	3266	2	3	When I was in seventh grade I had a mission to read every author's books I could get my hands on. Some of the material in her books proved to be a little too racy for most middle schoolers and some parents had apparently deemed it inappropriate and our school librarian had made the decision not to carry it in the school's library. I was devastated, there would be no way my mother would agree to buy me all twenty some odd books that she had written and I didn't have enough money from my meager allowance and various lemonade stands to purchase them myself. Back then, this censorship which banned my favorite books from ever showing their covers in our school's library, bothered me immensely. I couldn't understand why some people's parents would view some of the subject matter in her books as too mature for our age group. However, I am having a change of heart. Now I can understand why our school's library might not be so fond of carrying books with racy aspects to them. That is why I believe that in school libraries, some books should be censored or marked mature. In public libraries though, these books should not be censored.  Books need to be censored in school libraries because some children might be too immature to handle the subject matter within the book's pages. Most parents want their children to stay as innocent as possible for as long as possible and I can respect this idea. Having advanced books would also make the school look bad as not all parents would be on board with the idea and some would complain about their children reading something which they didn't intend them to find out about for many years to come.  Not all censorship has to do with sex. Another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type. The real-time war story which depicts the horrors of fighting for one's country and juxtaposes it with the thought that war is valiant and something to be applauded in the people back home. Some of these stories can get very graphic as to convey the point that war is not all fine and dandy and all it seems cracked up to be. These type of stories are important for our culture to prevent any misconceptions we might have or try to prevent them from a young age by shocking the reader. War should not be perceived as something fun and exciting and young people should know that so when they reach the age of signing up for the military they don't go into it misguided. In these instances, these violent stories are important for our youth to see and I think that they should not be censored in the library.  One might raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence. I am not advocating that books with unnecessary violence be put on the shelves. I believe that the books with violence which helps to convey an important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries.  Public libraries are a far different story. They have different sections for children's literature and adult literature. In school libraries the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers. While in the public library it is the exact opposite, (unless the case in a children's public library). Most public libraries carry mostly adult books and a small section of children's books. In this type of setting it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section, marked mature. The subject matter doesn't really matter but the point of public libraries is to educate our citizens and if what they want to read is violent or sexually explicit then so be it, as long as they are reading at all and using the government funded resources provided for them. If the library was privately owned then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to.  The purpose of libraries is to educate the citizens of this country and try to better them and help them make clear informed decisions based on their prior knowledge. If the books are censored then some messages might not get conveyed and misinformation might run adrift. We must prevent this at any way possible, ensuring that access to a wide range of ideas and perspectives remains available to foster a well-informed society.
290	3267	2	3	In my opinion, they should not censor books. They should be read the way that the author intended for them to be read. I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they can be played on the radio and in the theaters.  The books that are controversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. They were written with this language because that's the way people talked back then. These books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves. Altering them would be a disservice to the author's original vision and the historical context they represent.  In the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. It should not be changed, as its powerful themes about racism and morality are timeless and impactful precisely because of their authentic presentation.  It is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. When an artist writes a song, they know that it won't be able to be played on the radio if it has bad or graphic language. I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so it can be played on the radio for all to hear. This is a practical compromise for broader airplay.  The song 'Forget You' by CeeLo Green, they replaced the explicit word with 'Forget'. When he wrote this song, he knew that it wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and it is still a good song. The core message and catchiness remain intact.  Movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if it is too graphic. They might take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once it is sold in stores, allowing viewers to experience the director's full vision at home.  I understand and respect everyone's opinion on this matter, I am just voicing mine. If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made it so, and thus we should honor their original creations as they were presented.
291	3268	2	3	Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore they serve one primary purpose, right? To be read and engaged with, well that's what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be taken off the shelf. I think they shouldn't be taken off the shelves. Because if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and may offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things they're not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids from smoking and doing drugs if they hear or look at those cautionary things from experience. Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you may not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening by educating on the dangers. So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger and more informed people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean and aware. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things. This is why I think books that offend some people shouldn't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This simple action could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf, preserving access for all. Just as they are today in our local library, this system allows for personal choice without imposing limits on others.
292	3269	2	3	Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers, reflecting a diverse range of interests. Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one. True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive to some viewers? In my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. If a book or magazine or whatever it may be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. People should not take this censorship ability out of hand and use it to restrict access for everyone. I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it through a formal process. People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige. I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. In doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people, not from the entire community. All in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? I do, because it gives people the oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive, while still respecting the rights of others.
293	3270	2	3	I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them; it is a simple matter of personal choice. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive to my ears. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language, but I make my own choices. Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it, preventing any unintended offense. Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them, such as checking reviews or ratings. I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere, and a library's purpose is to serve that diverse community.
294	3271	2	3	Censorship of books. Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public by younger audiences. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen by children, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated 'R' or 'PG-13' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff. But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on 'American slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand its historical context. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read by certain ages or just never be found in a children's section. But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines well I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the 'Harry Potter' series and then I watch the movies I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right. For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period. Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is country, pop, classic rock, punk, metal, etc like I said I could go all day on music. The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example 'Spongebob Squarepants' seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad but people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids 'I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.' I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them and consider their intent and audience.
295	3272	2	3	Libraries have tons of books, cd's, movies, and magazines for people to read. They have all kinds for people who have intrest in certain things, and some materials might be offensive to some people, so let me tell you what I think! Most people like stuff that is interesting to them and some like other things, which is why variety is essential. There are certaint things for people for certaint ages to look at, there is a kids section, there is a teen section and there is an adult section, which helps organize content. There could be some stuff that people will think is offensive, but that doesnt mean they would have to take it off the shelf; they simply do not have to grab it. It is as simple as that. You can always choose to walk away from something you find disagreeable. And that's all there is to it; that's what I think about library products like that and what people should do to avoid getting stuff that is offensive to them: if you do not like it, just do not check it out!
296	3273	2	3	I for one like books, movies, music, etc., without censoring. Sheltering the young is not too bright because they'll get curious of things and sometimes they dont tell us; they just find out for themselves, often from peers or the internet. Most media and books have things uncensored for many different reasons, such as artistic expression or realistic portrayal of life, and I think its going good. Yes there are some youth that take somethings too seriously but thats because the parents are not there to explain and provide proper context. I'm not saying go and show a four year old a rated 'R' movie but lighten up on somethings. Music is everywhere it's kind of hard to shelter your kid from music anyways because it's, well everywhere, playing in stores, on the radio, and through friends' headphones. You should be there to watch what there listening to but they're going to hear it sooner or later, might as well let them hear it around you then some one else that will give them the wrong advice. Some parents complain so much about this subject because they don't want to have to be there all the time to explain everything, but then why have a kid if you can't take that responsibility. Books are not so different, if a book has certain things that parents dont want their children reading then take it away from them. But most books with that kind of stuff don't have any pictures so they would have to imagine it and if they don't know what is being talked about then they wont be able to think of anything bad anyways. I'm not going to be a careless parent but I don't think sheltering kids from the real world and media and books is a good idea, very unwise. Kids are going to learn about curse words, drinking, and stuff like drugs someday, it's up to the parents to be there and teach the kid from right and wrong if they have a question from something they heard or watched or read. People worry too much about censoring and making sure everything is clean but media and books are not all clean, never has been 'till some people got lazy and didn't want to be there for their child 100%. When I was young my parents didn't shelter me or keep me from reading what I wanted to read, and I turned out fine. I don't drink or do drugs, because my parents were there if I had a question about something I didn't understand in a book or media. It's not the media or literature it's the parents, and if they can't be there to explain then why did they become parents. And as for magazines, if a parent is really that worried about certain ones around their children then don't let them buy them it's your choice. Don't you want your kid to get out there and live their own life when they become an adult? Then don't shelter them from everything. Let them find out about stuff when they ask a question. If they read something in a book and don't understand it then either you could tell them whether it's right or wrong or let them find out the bad way, that's your choice. If they see something on television then explain don't just freak out and block them from knowing what's out there in the real world. It's your choice to make on all that, but if you shelter them too long they'll never have a good life. Sheltering may not seem so bad now but wait 'till they get older and start they're lives, they wont know what to do or how to talk to people right. I've seen it with my own eyes on how bad sheltering kids from media and books can take effect on certain things in a human being's life, like their social skills and understanding of the world. Censoring everything isn't good, the only way to learn anymore these days about real life is media and books. Not censoring all that will help people see what the world needs to work on. So don't censor everything and let the next generation know what the generation before did wrong, allowing them to build a better future with a full understanding of the past.
297	3274	2	3	In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof. People call these buildings libraries. Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge, providing a vital service to the community. If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet. I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody, and what one person finds troubling, another may find valuable. There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand. The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to. Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks, making total censorship an impractical goal. Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room, which helps to naturally guide patrons. As a young child, I liked going to libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way, as they are usually content in their own designated area. In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library, which suggests the current system works effectively. Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent's signiture. This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent, placing the decision-making power where it belongs. Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way. Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials. The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest. Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities, as they would be stripped bare of meaningful content.
298	3275	2	3	Dear Editor of the Newspaper, or to whom this article may concern. It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today. Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace. Technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor effectively without overreach. Two weeks ago i took my six year old niece Emily to our local public library to find her a book. Once the automatic doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section. I couldnt help but laugh, because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library. When i asked Emily what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and, said 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. 'I can't let my young niece watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre', I thought silently to myself. Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information, even in a place meant for learning. I agree with the statement of the author in some degree. I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant of important topics. But when we let our children ,the future of the world, vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected, like teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines. For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like Adolf Hitler's famous book intitled 'Mein Kampf', which means my struggle in german. My six year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children, and such material is not suitable for her. Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored, this includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and television. I believe books should be censored by content much like movies, with a clear rating system. This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effect, ensuring that parents can make informed choices for their children.
299	3276	2	3	That saying Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I disagree with that statement. I think it is the goverment's choice if these items should be taken out of libraries or not, based on established guidelines. So we will need ligitement reason's to take some books off the shelf, not just personal discomfort. Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kid's our history, like those about war or social struggles. People don't have that right to take away from children. In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea; taking away our kids right to learn US history. The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away, which is a disservice to their education. Then what will our future generation be like, lacking knowledge of their own past? Some kid's might not even know who George Washington is or how we got here to this very continent. Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity. I see what theese parents are trying to do. They are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they arn't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older and encounter it unexpectedly. Some kids that have that right taken away from will have no idea what to do when they get older and the foul language in the texts of theese books put voice into the books, making the stories more realistic. We don't want the up coming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world they must eventually navigate. When I was was in fifth grade I liked to read alot. I really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that. One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not apropriate for me. That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more, which is a shame. So adults that want to take theese books of the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn, creating a cycle of ignorance. Theese are just a couple of reason we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are more people out there that have reasons to, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because will fight for this right. So you adults who want to take that book off the shelf, you better have real good ligitement reason to take it off, as the default should always be towards access and education.
300	3277	2	3	Censorship is a tricky concept. It is a word that can ban music from stores, books from shelves, and movies from theaters. Katherine Paterson, an author, said that if all things reading or listening materials were removed, nothing would be left. I thoroughly agree with that statement. If someone finds one aspect of a work offensive, that does not qualify for the work to be banned or discarded. I believe offensive material should not be removed because of the following reasons: it suppresses the feelings of the author, nothing will be left on the shelves, and there is no defining line on what is or is not offensive. Now, I understand there is a vast amount of people who are against my position. I assure them that I understand those feelings. Some audiences feel that the removal of offensive material is good because it shields the ears of those who cannot handle the verbage or context. Others may feel that sensitive audiences might not be comfortable with the text. In addtion, many people believe that exposing people to violent, risky, and material with dangerous habits will evoke the same behavior in young children. Though these are all valid opinions, they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves. Contrary to the opinions of others, I believe one reason this material should be kept on the shelves because if it is not on the shelves, the the thoughts and feelings of the writer will be suppressed. For instance, the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was banned for a long time. Harper Lee's book, may have had some slurs we might find offensive today. However, that is the way people in that time spoke. Who are we to fault the people of the 1930s and 1940s for how that articulate words? By banning 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for the time frame that it was banned, generations were robbed of the powerful and beautiful meaning of the entire book. That meaning was that you cannot punish the innocent because they have done nothing wrong. The same for done for this book. This is one reason why I believe that should stay on the shelves. Next, works of literature and music should stay on the shelves because as Katherine Paterson said if everyone removes a book, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is very true. Many books have been on the banned book list. For instance there is 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' 'Catcher in the Rye,' 'Beloved,' and the like. What book will be removed from the shelves next? Once society is relieved of all literature, the next step will be music. Look at the singer/songwriter Prince. He made some very sexually themed music. When people bought his records in the 1980s, they had to be covered or placed in brown papered bags. They may be considered censorship, but that is one step away from being banned. His record company refused to produce his music under his name because of
301	3278	2	3	Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the argument of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others may not. The censorship that I am discussing is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone. The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored there will be less books for people to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored some people may never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it. Another person may enjoy that book and many others may like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to. The last reason is parents can limit what their children read. If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is inappropriate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler. Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves. The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Someone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true. First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public. Also people have the right to choose what they want. Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a book's chance to be loved by censoring it.
302	3279	2	3	Some people ask, 'Why should books be censored from libraries?' There are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books. I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on what the subject matter of those things are about. It's also the parent's job to monitor what their kids read, listen to, or watch. There's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job. Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. What one person thinks is bad, another may not. It goes the other way, too: what one person thinks is good, another may think is bad. On the subject of movies, there are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a scary movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least thirteen. I though it was ridiculous because it was only a scary movie, and it was harmless. With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't necessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it. In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on what the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. What one parent thinks is bad, another may not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magazines shouldn't be censored. Parents can just decide what they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to.
303	3280	2	3	Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In todays world it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time. Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or two. People may interpret it different than others. Therefore I personally dont think they should take articles out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornography then they should definitely take it out. My conclusion is that you cant please everybody. I think that you shouldn't take things out of the library that can help a student learn, as the primary purpose of a library is to provide educational and enriching materials for its community.
304	3281	2	3	At a local library you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style and of different stories. Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest. Some people may find certain books disturbing and inappropriate, that the book shouldn't be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people, what one person finds disturbing and gross another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye catching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inappropriate, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagrees upon the reading material as unacceptable to their community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it. Everyone should be given the same opportunity to read the book that another made find inappropriate. People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wander over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesn't want her child to be able to pick up a porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where children won't be able to view them. Now some books may have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that may have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the community and save lives. Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard. Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitement, sorrow and anger. We all have different hungers for different reading, music and fashion. In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who don't share the same views, who look upon life in a different way, whose voices aren't all the same. The book has a curse word in the text, that doesn't mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life. Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material. We should all be given the opportunity to read or not read what another person finds inappropriate. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unacceptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implied with the pursuit to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many inappropriate context is included. Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be merry in what they read.
305	3282	2	3	Dear Library Board Members: My name is Sarah and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries. And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation. There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate. Many people have different opinions then other people. Everyone had a different point of view and sees things differently. Especially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids. I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate. The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it. And if she finds it not appropriate then she has the right to take it off the shelf. If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not appropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library. Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area. I have actually had an experience with this. At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate. When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books. The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library. So she had a great idea. She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk. If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book. It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldn't even see them. And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all. Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material. Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they might be interested in. I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too. I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme. There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoys the stuff there. There should be action, adventure, humor, love, etc. Talk to people and see what they like. And just because one person complains, don't take it out right away because to another person they might love it. Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped.
306	3283	2	3	i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take the music, movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get away and relax the self at the library to read a good book or listen to calming music. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library for that very purpose. And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there. my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is that they will not make a profit from the late fees or the services they provide. when the people go to the library and they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen and they might not return. i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the books off the shelves. I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone. Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out. But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out for their own enjoyment. I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home. My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion and cause a lot of confusion. So by removing all of that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read to feel better. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books, music or magzines on the shelves in the first place. But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people who depend on the library. I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc for their personal hobbies. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there to find some peace. I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to and would not want to cause trouble. One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our music player something like that without being disturbed. Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer or to study together. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc if the library closes down because no one comes anymore.
307	3284	2	3	Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word? Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society, whether on television or in public conversations. Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries have offensive language that can be jarring. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, adding a layer of authenticity, but in other cases the reader might be offended and put the book down. In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf and choose another one. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it, so it represents their creative vision. Some material might be inappropriate for younger readers who are not yet mature enough. The maturaty level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship and what is suitable. For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The Big Lebowski' for its use of alcohol and drugs throughout the story. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining, appreciating its humor. Should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs, or should it remain for those who enjoy it? These words and actions we try to censor are not going away from our daily lives. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you might be, from the supermarket to the schoolyard. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one that better suits your tastes and sensibilities.
308	3285	2	3	I think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf, depending on how they are offensive and the severity of the content. If they are offensive by rachism or being prejudice i think they shouldnt be on the shelfs because they promote harmful ideas. Also if it is offensive to women or men then it should be taken off of the shelfs to maintain a respectful environment. People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it and feel comfortable in the library. I think that if it is offensive to different races then yes it should be taken off the shelfs. I think this because, children can read this and then, they would beleieve that it is right to be races against other races, which is a dangerous lesson. I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others and without learning bad values. Also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others through the materials they find. People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others in the community, leading to arguments. It could cause problems for the libraies also, doing this by people not wanting to come back due to the fact of they have offensive material available for checkout. Then with people not wanting to be there then the libraies wont have enough service and they will have to close down eventually. I also believe that if the masterial is offensive to women/men then it should be taken off the shelf immediately. The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive, because alot of people look at them like they are trash and not respectful. It makes a bad impression on some people who visit the library for the first time. Its rude for it to be there where anyone can see it. It puts not very good thoughts in some peoples heads about how to treat others. I believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf to prevent issues. It can cause many problems with others in the community who are upset by it. It could cause us to lose libraies if others choose not to go anymore because of the content available. Things should not be left around if they are offensivce in any way and should be removed to keep the library a welcoming place for everyone.
309	3286	2	3	There are people out there that think somethings should be taken off the shelves or not even made at all. But thats their decision and not everyone should listen to it or just try to do it because opinions vary. I think things that are offensive should and shouldn't be taken off, which seems contradictory. They should because it might offend someone and create a negative environment, and it shouldn't beacuse then people can read or see it or even listen to it if its music and then know more about it and then they might not do the same things, learning from the content. So people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too, which is a personal freedom. They might not want their kids to read it but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also, like from friends or online. I think they shouldn't be taken off because no matter what they do or what they say, stuff will still be out there in the world that people think are offensive and you just cant stop all of it from existing. I listen to a lot of music when I drive to school and most of it is rap music, which I enjoy. Yes, most of it is ofensive to girls and stuff but thats just music, it doesn't mean its true or anything, it's just entertainment. People have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it if they find it disagreeable. If they think it is offensive to them or to anyone else or just not like it, they have thr right to just avoid it and not look at it, which is simpler. People want to just change everything and make sure things are perfect and nothing bad is in the world, but that is not realistic. But no matter what you try to do, something bad will be out there waiting for you, so you have to be prepared. You just got to know how to avoid it and make your own choices. Avoiding things that you don't like would be a lot easier then just taking all the time you have to to try to get something banned off of a shelf, which is a long process. You should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what its all about and form their own opinions. When I read or listen to something thats offensive and I don't like it, I will just turn it off or not read it anymore, which is my right. Not try to get it banned because that takes to much time and effort for little gain. People should just not worry about what is being said or written and try to get it banned becuase another book will be out again and it will be the same, so it is a cycle. So as you can see I think the material that is written should just stay as it is and people can have their choice on if they want to read it or not, which is fair. If they do and they think its offensive then thats their fault for reading it when they know its gonna offend them, so they are responsible. And for the people who don't read it, they are doing it because they know it will offend them, so they are making a smart choice. So not reading something that you don't like will be better in the end because then nothing will be banned and maybe nothing else will be made in the process of it being banned, avoiding conflict. So nothing should be banned and just keep it and everything will still be the same as it always has been. We might not want our kids to read something bad but they will one day so why not just get it done and over with in the benginging and teach them instead of hiding things.
310	3287	2	3	Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see, providing a sense of security. In the kids section, they have kid's books that are age-appropriate and safe. In the adult section they have adult books with more complex themes. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that might be what their parents don't want them seeing, offering a separation. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended, which is a common practice. Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing for intellectual freedom. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading and find valuable. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight and frustrated with the library's choices. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out, though others might. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there, as a compromise. For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have 'Parental Advisory' stickers on them, indicating their content. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library for those who seek it. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out without bothering others. Books always have reviews on the covers, so people can tell if those are too explicit or not before borrowing. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section based on those reviews. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated R or above on those shelves to restrict access. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before, in my experience. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as 'Playboy' or 'Hustler' there, as they are too explicit. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience, as libraries are generally careful. That is my solution to this ongoing debate. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely, which is a balanced approach. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material if it were removed. You couldn't take away movie classics like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'The Godfather' because they are important. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists for their artistic merit. Yes, they are rated R for their content but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies that many enjoy. Don't take the material out and limit access. Just make a new section for it so that everyone can be happy and find what they need.
311	3288	2	3	There are thousands of libraries throughout the world, all of which are filled with numerous books, magazines, music, movies, and other materials for people of all ages to obtain. Some people think that materials in a library should be censored while others think everything should be allowed to be there. I do not think materials at a library should be removed, or censored, because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research. Materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease. Everyone has different opinions on what they think is appropriate or not. If one person were to decide a book was inappropriate and take it off the shelf, another person would have the right to take another book that they thought was inappropriate off the shelf as well. However, since everyone has different beliefs on what is appropriate and what is not, the books would rapidly decrease. The same would apply to the other items at the libraries such as magazines, movies, and other media, leading to a sparse and unhelpful collection. Another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library. A fifty year old man would not have the same interests as a thirteen year old girl, so if some materials were removed, there would not be as much of a variety to choose from. If there is a little variety to choose from due to materials being censored, the amount of people using the library would decrease, causing the library to eventually get shut down from the lack of people using it. Lastly, materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research. A child from high school could go to the library to look for a book to help research things for a report in one of their classes, or an elder woman could go to the library in search of a cookbook to research something new to make for her next home cooked meal. Both people would need a material from the library to help them with their research, but if some materials at the library were removed, they might not be able to find something to help them, thus hindering their learning and personal projects. Materials at a library should not be censored because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research. Some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed, but I strongly disagree. There are many different materials in the libraries around the world today for people of all ages to come in contact with, and that is the way it should stay for the benefit of all.
312	3289	2	3	In my opinion, I don't really think certain items should be removed from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion, I never remove anything from a library because I know there are a lot of people with many interests. At the same time, I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, because they could not be appropriate for children. If we removed certain items from the library, people would get mad. I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can also make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area by having clear signage and perhaps even a separate room. If we don't remove nothing from the library, we would have a lot of people coming. On the other hand, if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens, smaller amounts of people will come, which would hurt the library's purpose and community standing. In my personal opinion, no item should be removed from the library because many people have many interests in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library, then we would lose a certain amount of people. That's why we should not remove anything from the library to prevent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said, many people have many interests in many things and they deserve to enjoy them in the library, and a well-organized library can cater to everyone safely.
313	3290	2	3	Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they can even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offensive language and not so well of pictures. They might be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, and other materials need to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids cannot go or reach, ensuring a safe environment for all. A library is a family place, not a fun zone for adults. On a certain day, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. He is only six about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosaurs, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. He was very into reading. He read to our mom every night before he would go to bed. We were walking down the street when a bolt of lightning struck through the trees. 'Ekkkk!' said my brother as he ran around me. We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sort of ignore her and go on about our business picking our books for him. My brother and I walk upstairs to the children's section. He is looking around and he says 'hey Kayla, what is this?' and he picks up a naughty magazine. I rush over to snatch it out of his hands and he gets scared. He asks 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond. I tell him to pick a book and come on. He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off. It was completely dark. 'Everyone stay calm,' a man says. The back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area. We sit there for twenty minutes and the lights are back on. Everything is normal again and we go to check out. We get up to the front and I turn in the bad magazine that my brother had found. The lady asked why I was bringing it to her and I had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the children's section. She said 'oh my!' My brother laid his books up on the counter and we checked out. We walked out the front doors and we were on our way home, and this experience showed me why proper placement of materials is so important.
314	3291	2	3	Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefore, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not through the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in. Throughout history, mankind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happened throughout history. With those experiences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensive'. If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of, making the task impossible. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books, rendering the library useless. The second reason is that people have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music, making a universal standard impossible to achieve. The third reason is that people will experience all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restaurant, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book because it uses a certain word in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say that word and replace them with books that say a different word instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authenticity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it, that statement or passage loses its power on its readers. In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still experience 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and people will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.
315	3292	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored. An idea that is offensive to one person may not be offensive to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion may believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people have differing religious beliefs. One religious text may be offensive to someone of another religion, and because of that the text would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, may not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors might say forget it and not even write anymore, which would be a great loss. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored. If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me might find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book, and may even be central to the theme. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored. A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, may not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same. For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed if we wish to preserve
316	3293	2	3	Recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention. This is unfortunent in the extreme. People have a right to unmolested knowledge and censoring libraries is a direct violation of that right. Libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way, serving as a repository for all human thought and experience. History is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious. We aren't always proud of want we do or what happens but those events remain, irrespective of whether or not we choose to acknowledge it. To think turning a blind eye to the less than clean will make it go away is not only unrealistic but also totally ignorent of facts, as it prevents us from learning from past mistakes. I realise that there are some things chilldren should not see or hear and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things. I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general. We can't shelter our children forever and sooner or latter they will learn things we wish they didn't. This is inevitable. Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them, leaving them unprepared for reality. Do children need to be protected for some things? Yes, for a time, they do but it is the role of the induvidual parent to protect their child, not the institution of the library. Protect the children but don't do so at the expence of everyone else. Why should the views of some hinder all others? Those who would persume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch. Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected for natural, form history, or from their own desires have no more right, and preahaps even less than everyone else to interfere with induvidual decision making. People have a right to make their own choices on what them believe but no right to force those oppinions on others. This essay @MONTH1 make no difference but it has said what needed to be said and thus served it's purpose. With that task completed I can finnish with a good concious.
317	3294	2	3	I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, whch means rascitism or being offended, are part of that shared history. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you , just turn it off. You aren't being force to listen or read it, its your choice to continue or to stop. Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with, and learning to navigate it is a part of personal growth. There @MONTH1 be people out there that probably disargree's with me, its just my oponion. You @MONTH1 go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their oponions on the selection of materials the library offers. I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet @CAPS1 happen to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police. She could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it or simply ignoring the content. I feel that the mintue she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's oponion. Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were rasied or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or @MONTH1 do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them, and understanding different perspectives is crucial. In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials. They are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic. Its just apart of life.
318	3295	2	3	Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items @MONTH1 be offensive towards others? There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf. I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive and may actually benefit from it. For example, @PERSON1 might want to read a book about abortion, but @CAPS1 is against and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as @PERSON1, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject. Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book @MONTH1 be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read, severely limiting the diversity of available information. Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, ect., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about, ultimately diminishing the library's role as a comprehensive resource.
319	3296	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 ,           I dissagre with removing materials from the library. I personally do not think it is the libraries fault if someone is offened by books, movies , music or magazines etc. If they did not like the book or movie it is their fault for picking it in the first place, as personal responsibility is key. Children who are under the age of thirteen should not be able to watch movies that are not for them , they should not be seeing those bad movies or scary movies at such a young age. I  want the libraries to think this over ; because it is not fair to adults or older children who are capable of handling more mature content. Movies that are funny entertain children daily ; some children even quote movies and make other children laugh. I know for a fact us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day , well that is what I do at least. There are some movies out there that are just so funny , I could quote ever line of it. Music on the other hand is very important to teens these days. It is always enjoyable to me. I love music without it I'm not quite sure where I would be in this world. I love many  different kinds of music , most of it is very fun to listen to. I'm not a big fan of rock , you would not see me picking that up from the library.Us teens love music , we use music for pretty much everything. We dance to it , sing to it , workout to it , and most of all we just enjoy it, finding solace and expression in its rhythms. Books are always important , even though I do not like to read that often I still like to read books that interest me. For example you would not see me reading a scary book , because it would just remind me of the movie , and I would have nightmares. The books that interest me the most are fiction books. My two favorite books are A @CAPS1 To @CAPS2, and The @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Both of those books are by the author @PERSON1. I love all of his books but these ones are the best. Please re think your decission about getting rid of the bad music , books , and  movies. @CAPS2 it is not the libraries fault it is the people who are borrowing them. If they do not like it then they should have never taken it home in the first place. I say we just let it be, and let people be happy with their own choices.
320	3297	2	3	There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age, which can be concerning for parents. Childeren check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age. The libraries are supposed to make sure your @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language, as a basic protective measure. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different, with more explicit content readily available. My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things, as maturity levels vary greatly between individuals. It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not, giving families the primary role in guiding their children's consumption. My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree, these guidelines are necessary. There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them, fostering a sense of responsibility alongside protection.
321	3298	2	3	Many people base their actions on their own views. What may appear to be justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this: media censorship. It happens every day, in every place. Someone can take it upon themselves to, in their mind, 'make the piece better for public viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeding on the rights granted to us by the constitution: Freedom of the Press. First up, books in the library. Every time I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out with a heavy black marker. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and, for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others may enjoy it, whether they share your views or not. People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as American citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should not be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I may learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable. With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called Freedom of Speech, and it is a right guaranteed to us, as free citizens, under the Constitution. And clearly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might not, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, may not be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it. People should not take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should not ruin the experience by marking the words out. Not only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should not be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in public libraries, the public should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the principles of the constitution, and it should be protected, not limited.
322	3299	2	3	Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive. All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books. Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have valid reasons for them. So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader. These books that are considered offensive to some people may not be offensive to others. For example, Susie, who is from the South, comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the Civil War, and she reads that the South is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves. Susie gets a little offended by this. Then little Johnny, who is an African American, picks up the same book and reads all about the South and how they treated their slaves. Little Johnny thinks that the same book that Susie hated is a great book. As shown in the example, America's people are very diverse, but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens. A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race, it wants to appeal to all of them, the only way to have that happen is to accidentally offend some people in the process. The citizens of the United States need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here. If a book offends a person, that person simply should not read it. However, these books, which many may find offensive, could also be beneficial to its readers. Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it. Going back to the Civil War reference, Susie was reading her American History text book, and she read about the horrible deeds the South had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the war to the Union, and she got offended because her side lost. Then little Jimmy, who is in the same class as Susie, was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on. He found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the Union defeated the South. Johnny was as happy as he could be with this book, whereas Susie couldn't be any more displeased. If this book was pitched out of the library, how would students all over the nation learn of the Civil War? They wouldn't. Libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone. As Katherine Paterson said, if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them, then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one, and so on and so forth. So, libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books. This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to. We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't.
323	3300	2	3	Censorship in libraries, in my opinion is over-rated. Everywhere you hear of books, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it may not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read. Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelf because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broader view as so many people are lucky to have today. Everyone has a different opinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person sees a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The Holocaust, because they think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The Holocaust is a big part in history and it being categorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten. Lastly I believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offensive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the ones that could pick for them. With so many different opinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.
324	3301	2	3	Dear School Board, Principal, my name is Jane Doe and I think that everyone has a right to their own opinion. People may not want their kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them where their kids can't find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than movies, books, and music that children listen to, watch, or read. I think that the world is more harmful sometimes than anything. Adults might want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on TV. But, if their kids wanna learn about things that happen that's not the greatest, then people should let them. It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people don't like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who don't like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchased at the age of eighteen. That's why people should be ok with things that don't involve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that it was made that way it should be kept that way. I'm sure many people may not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way. Sincerely, Jane Doe.
325	3302	2	3	I believe as a citizen of this city and as an avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is necessary. Some of the material in the libraries today are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color? In today's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie 'Remember the Titans.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the African-American children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is necessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is African-American, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in my opinion. In today's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You may think that it is okay to let your child watch a movie rated PG-13, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet. Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked my mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries. Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You may think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary. I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It may be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite R-rated movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child.
326	3303	2	3	I'm writing this paper today to talk about censorship of books, movies, music, etc. I think that there should only be certain things on the shelf that children can see. If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is acceptable. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappropriate should not be visible to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the shelves and placed somewhere else, like a separate, restricted section. Also, the music on the radio is censored yes, but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get offended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on television, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people, especially children, believe that certain things are acceptable and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inappropriate is shown to people, making them believe it is all okay. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are playing video games such as Grand Theft Auto and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's acceptable and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask for an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less common in our society.
327	3304	2	3	How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as, 'What did you say to me fool'? Would you want to keep things like that in your libraries? I would, I think anything that was hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and opportunity to learn. Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people are required to read; they are things we are required to have. Sure it might hurt, depress, or even aggravate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past. For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries. Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either died from or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it how can it be prevented. Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide. I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it. Literature about difficult topics provides a necessary mirror to our world, allowing us to confront hard truths. In conclusion, I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public. I think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn. I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime.
328	3305	2	3	Why should books or other such ideas be censored, but let's get back to the subject. Should certain books be allowed to be in a library? Cause if you don't have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick; you have history, poems, dramas, love, scary. But some are not appropriate for certain places. Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not approve of. Like there's rap; it's a bunch of people rhymes. That people think up in their heads about life. Something that they want to express by telling rapping. There is rock and roll; a lot of people did not care for it when it was introduced in the late 1950s but as time went on people started listening to it. But a lot of people did not want their kids listening to that; back then they said it was devil music. But in this day and age a lot of people still listen to rock n roll. Cause they were brought up on that kind of music. Movies; there is a lot of different movies out there. There are PG-13 and rated R movies but a lot of parents do not let their kids watch certain movies because they scare their kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people can't stand it. But there are shows for kids too; they're like a movie but a little shorter. Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines cause they have a lot of time on their hands. But there are some people who can't get enough of magazines. Cause they want to buy everything in the book. It catches their eyes by the way it looks. But there is all kinds of different magazines: muscle, food, cleaning, toys. But that's what I think about this kind of stuff; it sucks people in but some can't get out, and by the time they get out they are broke from spending all their money.
329	3306	2	3	If we were to take away everything that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. It's not right to take away from others something because a select group of people take offense at it. Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There are many different reasons why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right. First, whether you find something offensive or not, is largely based on your culture. To most Middle Eastern cultures, declining food is offensive. To Hindus, eating or hurting cows in any way is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it may be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone. Second, one of the best thing's about the United States is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs would be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shelf because someone took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal. Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a book cover with a pentagram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's a reminder of why I believe what I do. I may be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group ISIS is greatly offended when they see the American flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed. I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many things offensive. It'd take away everything if we removed each and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind us of who we are. We should be strong enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what America was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people.
330	3307	2	3	During school one day all of our teachers told the class that most of the books in the library are going to be taken off the shelves. But our class doesn't want that to happen. All the teachers told us that some people's parents have been complaining about what their kids are reading. I think that most of the books that are in the library are good for the kids to look at because that's what they like and they like to learn about what they would like to have or do someday. I also think that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life. Later in life when I have kids I would like them to dream about what they want to do in their life. So if that means that they want to go to school and look at magazines all day and make sure that that's what he wants to do, that's fine with me. So if the teachers want the books off the shelves they can, but I don't think that the kids are going to try much if they can't be what they want to be later in their lifetime. I know that if they did that to my kids, I know I would buy them all the magazines they want so they can learn what they want to do in life. So if they take all the books off the shelves I know that all the kids' parents are probably going to get mad because that's what messes up the kids' dreams. Now when the kids want to read, the schools are taking all the good books off the shelves; none of the kids are going to know what they want to do in their later life. A good thing to do is to let the students vote and see what they want to do about taking the books off the shelves. I bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures. That means that they want to be something when they grow up. I hope that my kid wants to be something that he likes to do when he grows up. I will help any kid as much as I can with their dreams. There are two things that are going to happen. One is that the school is going to take the books off the shelves and the students are not going to try in school and they might not know what they want to be. Or they might just give up on it all. And I know that no one wants that to happen. The second thing is that the schools are going to keep the books on the shelves and the students are going to want to read them more. Also they will probably know what they want to do later in their lifetime. If I could pick what to do I would keep the books on the shelves and make the kids happy and inspired for their future.
331	3308	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries. I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In today's generation everyone has their own opinion on censorship, shaped by their unique experiences and backgrounds. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things. Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out, not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted, limiting their access to diverse ideas. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out and marginalized. For example, if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library; it serves a community of varied individuals. Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch, and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have different interests and perspectives as a result. Not everyone likes the same things, and that diversity should be reflected in a library's collection. In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to libraries and learn about different things that they want to learn about, from hobbies to complex social issues. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to history and science. If libraries censored what people can read, watch, and listen to, not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to, stifling personal growth. Libraries can not censor their materials! I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public. People are different and that is okay; a library should celebrate that. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opportunities to access information. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want, making choices for their own family. Not every parent chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests and can explore the world freely. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things, and a library should cater to all curiosities. The libraries who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have an equal chance to learn and form their own opinions. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines.
332	3309	2	3	I believe it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear or do not understand. If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it, which is a form of intellectual theft. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but that's life, you have to learn to let those things go and not impose your views on others. Everyone has a right to form their own views and opinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's opinions and engage with challenging material. Reading expands our vocabulary and our understanding of the world, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it or find value in it. You have to give them a chance to form an opinion for themselves. Libraries are everywhere in our communities. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections and guide them appropriately. All libraries are broken down in sections, such as children's, young adult, and adult fiction and non-fiction. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area, allowing them to read age-appropriate material. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develop an opinion on what types of books they enjoy most, fostering a lifelong love of reading. We live in a free country, which since founded has been all about freedom of thought and expression. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, so these people rely on public libraries as their primary source of information and entertainment. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read, missing out on the joy and benefits of literacy. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf due to someone else's complaint. There is also a religion conflict to consider. There are many different versions of the Bible but, many different religions with their own sacred texts. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not believe in the Bible do we take that off the shelves too? That would be a profound injustice. In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things, often from a place of genuine concern. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear, and fear is not a good basis for policy. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish and become more informed, empathetic citizens.
333	3310	2	3	Cooling the Classics: Plato and Aristotle From Book Bans _________ Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution and its foundational principles. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey; it must be a repository for all human thought. One point of a library, the destination of researchers and the curious alike, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety and intellectual freedom. Books are incapable of judgment; they simply present ideas. To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress and the collective understanding we have built over centuries. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the globe, precludes the idea of this censorship as it contradicts our core values. If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same scrutiny and potential defense? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen, a culture of inquiry. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings, a marketplace of ideas. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works, allowing readers to judge their merit. From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life and identity. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless and isolating. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid and felt invisible. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes or a story that reflected my own feelings. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted from general access. More insulting than finding books of LGBTQ+ issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately, as if they were something to be hidden. Here lies the fundamental problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear and cease to exist. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction, a willful blindness. But books cannot shout their values; they sit quietly until chosen. They cannot shove information down our throats; we must willingly accept it. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge by opening them and turning the pages. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance, making it an active choice. If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily and with far less internal conflict. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well, fostering a more compassionate community. In the past few years, with the effects of historical tragedies and conflicts reaching the newest generation, our nation has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of war and of persecution. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies because the records are incomplete. In trying to construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of, a cultural amnesia. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void where knowledge and memory once lived. As such, architects have created what may be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost and cannot be recovered. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows, representing the absence. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning; it leaves a permanent scar. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished from the world. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taken from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it or be transformed by it? This is the profound effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame and extinguish its voice. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten, and a part of our shared humanity is diminished. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new, for they all have a place. Let the reader decide its value and its worth. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind based on their own needs. Give the book a chance for it may have a power that is unrealized until the right reader finds it. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom for all.
334	3311	2	3	Have you ever wondered how libraries pick their books? Well, I know I have, especially when considering what is appropriate for young minds. There are some material out there that no one wants a little kid to get a hold of, material that is too mature or disturbing. I believe censorship should be allowed in libraries, because the censorship of books is vital for the kids of the world to live a life without books about violence and explicit content, another reason is that it not only affects the lives of the children, but the social lives of everyone, and the overrated music of our generation that often glorifies negative themes. My reasons on this subject can be viewed in two different ways, but I would like to view it in my way, from the perspective of protecting the innocent. Look around, are their little children nearby in your community. Well, if there is I would be looking at what they are reading or doing, concerned for their well-being. The children might be reading books that are too explicit for their age, filled with concepts they cannot yet process. Take for example, a child that is six years old, and can do whatever he or she wants because of inattentive parents. They have no limits or guidance. So, one day the child decides I am going to check out a book at the library, wandering the aisles alone. The child obtains a book that is about graphic violence and sex, which could frighten or confuse them. What does the parent do when that child brings that book home? Nothing, in this scenario. The parents do nothing because they do not care about their own child's mental development. The time is now to step up to the plate, librarians, and take responsibility. Take a stand and censor those books, creating a safer environment. This is what could happen to anyone's child if there are books out their that could be harmful to anyone that picks them up, especially a vulnerable young person. Children aren't the only ones that are harmed by this deadly disease called noncensored books; the entire community feels the effects. Think about the conversations that go on in schools and at the work place, the topics that dominate discussion. What are the conversations mostly about? I would take a wild guess that they are mostly about sex and violence, topics picked up from media. How do these conversations come up? Well, one reason is uncensored books at the library that normalize such content. Anyone can check out a book at the library, regardless of age or intention. It could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers, and not all content is suitable for all. When I was little, my parents use to tell to go to the library and learn something valuable. What if the library didn't have censored books, what would I be reading? It could have been something damaging. Social lives are very affected by what they learn and how they learn the material, shaping their interactions and values. Lastly, why is that every time I turn on the radio, there is always a song that is not right for anyone to listen to, with explicit lyrics. I listen to the radio station 102.5 sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence and other mature themes. Guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs
335	3312	2	3
336	3313	2	3	I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others. There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library, such as graphic depictions or hateful ideologies. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem by limiting access for everyone. The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read, effectively punishing them for the potential exposure to children. So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone who is mature enough to handle its content, striking a fair balance for all patrons.
337	3314	2	3	People all judge things differently. Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What may be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library, but only if there is a significant consensus. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive. What might be offensive to one person may interest another. The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more, or simply for entertainment. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it. I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and may have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. Thats not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group, which is a more practical solution than removal. I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library. All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is, and libraries should reflect that diversity of taste and opinion.
338	3315	2	3	Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on thier shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine , etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelve because of it's content. Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people may find offensive or just completely oblivious. Every mind is diffrent when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. When ever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed on a different section of the library, perhaps one designated for mature audiences. Many books that people find as explicit content to them, may not be to others. When i was in middle school, i heard alot about sex, and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how did it feel. What i did know was that I could get accesible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks, and researches it. If i would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probabaly never been warned about the out comes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a libraby and observe. Not everyone is reading a book about rainbows, and unicorns. Many people read books about the real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kind of content, reguardless of others concerns. Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents may not be near others. They can organize there topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music can be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library. Far from the reach where kids and children are able to access, requiring identification for checkout. In conclusion I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines, music or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelve no matter what. No book should be removed because someone may find it offensive. If a person finds something offensive they should take it up with the author or publishers not the library for they only let people borrow the content, acting as a neutral provider of information.
339	3316	2	3	Censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated. If one person does not like the content of a text, that person could might find themselves saying that they have to right to obstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn't they have a say too? Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two', perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in this situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and pherhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In this case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed have a right to say and think what they feel about the text. Should 'person one' still have the right to say that this text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazing, book, and text that there is avalible. Some might say that this is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material. Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explecit.' This is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explecit', the is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median. Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explecit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that this material is not for them. Again, the happy-median. For every given case of a goup of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in this case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should this context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material, even if their access to it is not restricted.
340	3317	2	3	Have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. Im not racist but some people are very racist. Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them. In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me. In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that. Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers. Although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past and serves as a historical record of societal struggles.
341	3318	2	3	New @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3     Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read? I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies. I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the @CAPS3. This @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 should only be entered by an adult, or with an adults permission, ensuring that mature content is kept separate from general circulation.     Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff. What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true. By having this seperated @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3, it gives parents the chance to get the racist, drug/gang filled, and murder books away from the children. This will be good for every race too! If an african american family does not want there child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the @CAPS1 of books where slavery and gangs are. Some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions. If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themself, so having a designated area helps manage this risk.      I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it well help alot. People under the age of @NUM1 are not permitted to be in this @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 without a parent, or parent signature. This system provides a practical solution that respects both access and protection. So come on down to the @CAPS2 council on @DATE1 and vote for the new @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3! Thank you for your time.
342	3319	2	3	Censorship in the libraries would be liked cutting the worlds air supply. It would be taking away from a readers imagintion, stopping readers from being able to express their mind and explore new ideas freely.      My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed. Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels, using established classification systems. By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed. Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone. Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries, creating a cycle of conflict.      Books were made to keeping people wondering, learning, and excited. By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds. More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher. Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress. People minds would not be wondering, learning or being kept excited, which would be a great loss for society.      I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library. I was in the library looking for a book. I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out. The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back. Then i was able to check a book out, and this existing system worked perfectly well.      So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries. That would be tking away from a librarains job, which is to guide and curate, not to restrict and remove. So dont take away readrs imagintion and their freedom to choose.
343	3320	2	3	There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living, as this is a fundamental part of free enterprise.     When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright, placing the onus on parental guidance.      If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it, similar to purchasing age-restricted goods.      A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.     I conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law through proper legal channels.
344	3321	2	3	Censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries dictators do @CAPS4 allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases @CAPS4 even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they do @CAPS4 want the citiznes of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country but the people actually in the country have no idea whats going on around them, trapped in an information vacuum.     Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense it is still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact? Arguements over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much prgress at all. Each side of the arguement whether its for or against censorship is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or @CAPS4. It's just to hard to determine who's opinion is really, more convincing.     In my opinion I dont think anything should be consored, if the writer of a @CAPS1 show throws in a vulger word most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The samething goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing to much violence on @CAPS1 and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suiting for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just dont let your kids watch that show; use parental controls.      In the @LOCATION1 today we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on @CAPS1 you can make a decision simply to @CAPS4 watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO; if you dont want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do someting entirely different. You DO @CAPS4 have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born an just say no, I dont want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or @CAPS4 things need to be consored, putting the power of choice back into the individual's hands.
345	3322	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1,           Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age, which is a more reasonable approach than outright removal.      Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section. The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self. Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section. Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too, organized by their intended audience.      It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults, making the search efficient and straightforward.      So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager. That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate; access for education is important.     Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age. It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection, satisfying both the need for organization and the right to access information.
346	3323	2	3	It seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in today's world. In magazines, in books, in the lyrics of music, the possibilities of where to sneak in offensive references are endless, and they certainly pop up everywhere these days. But should your resources of where you find these materials be limited due to other people's morals or values? I disagree with this act, and I would like to tell you why I do. All of us have different morals, values, and senses of what is right and what is wrong; everyone's are different. Maybe it's your religion or culture that keep you from these materials. But why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot get from their library? I know I don't just speak for myself when I say I would be very annoyed if I couldn't get the books or materials I wanted or needed just because the person next to me doesn't agree with what is being found through researching it. I do believe certain things should be separated from other parts of the libraries. For example, books that would be found offensive to children should be kept away from where children can pick out things in a library, perhaps in a designated adult section. That is completely understandable. But when things are being removed entirely because certain people don't agree with them or find them offensive, that is when things are going too far. This nation was built on the grounds of freedom for what you believe in. So why should we force others to believe something we think? Just because I find something offensive, doesn't mean the person next to me does, which is completely fine with me. That is his or her own personal opinion, and what I believe should not keep him or her from learning about the things they would like to. One way to fix this problem would be to separate things that could possibly be found offensive into another section of the library and to put out a sign or paper saying what exactly can be found in that section, allowing for individual choice. In conclusion, no, I do not think libraries should be censored. I know I could walk into my local library and find things I found offensive right now, but I would not want my own opinion to effect someone else's viewing of that material. People should think about one another once in a while and not be so stuck on what they personally believe. The world is an opinionated place, if it were not we would have nothing. A library can be filled with useful materials, so the focus should be on what you can find in a library to help you, not on what is in the library that you do not want to see. If you find something offensive, simply stay away from it, but don't try to take it away from the rest of the world.
347	3324	2	3	Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it. I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them. There are three reasons why they should have censorship. First they can teach kids bad things, second bad influence, and third they just dont need to be there. First was they can teach kids bad thing. That is because they would start looking at it more and might begin to imitate the behaviors they see. Then they would get in trouble at school or at home. There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all, especially when there are so many other good books available. Second, its a bad influence. They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right, creating a chain reaction of poor behavior. Makeing then do stuff and then have a bad future filled with more serious problems. Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it. Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor, a child would have no business with such material. But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it, as it does not help them learn or grow in a positive way. I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life and have a better chance at success.
348	3325	2	3	I think that a censorship in libraries isn't needed. The grounds that are basing the censorship are very opinionated and biased ones. Two readers of one book could view the material completely differently; one might find it profound while another finds it offensive. The reader has chosen to read that book, and thus more than likely know what the general plot is before they read the first page because of the summary on the back. People can make their own decisions, and can therefore choose whether or not to read the book to begin with. The books that would be found inappropriate or offensive would most likely be in teen novels or adult literature. If this is the case, they should be mature enough to handle stumbling across the material, and or making the decision to put the book back and to not continue reading. Saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct, but at that age the children should be with an adult when checking out books anyway. The material that people find unacceptable would almost certainly be in a novel that is intended for a mature audience, so if it is being read by a younger age group that would be the problem in and of it's self. The teens and or adults whom would be reading such material is surely old enough to handle reading a few foul words and scattered innuendos throughout the plot. The material that may be found inappropriate or offensive may be viewed differently given two different audiences. A teen in high school has probably heard worse in the halls during passing; an adult that is worrying about what their children read has certainly been exposed to enough throughout their lifetime to either look past the text or to put it away. The material being called offensive just because of one person's views in not right. The tough situations and our surroundings are what prepare us for our futures. A person seeing the bad in life would be more likely to do all in their power to make good of their futures and be more willing to help make sure it could be prevented. Should the foul things in life be ignored? Should the child that is being beaten at home have to suffer in silence because it seems too graphic to tell? The man who became homeless, only to turn his life around because he learned from his past, should that story not be told only because the troubles he had to face seem too disturbing? I believe that these are the stories that need told the most, in an attempt to teach those around us how to prevent, and how to move past the troubles in life. There will always be things that we wish not to see in life. But is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are. The libraries should not be put on a censorship, but open to the public that wish to dive in to these stories. Books are written for a purpose, and that purpose may just be to let people know that these things are happening, and if one thinks they are alone in these strifes that they are not.
349	3326	2	3	I believe that indeed certain books should not be on libraries shelves if they are purely pornographic or promote violence. And some people may feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them from the children's section. I personally know parents that would not allow their children to read a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it ridiculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they don't take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it. I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocaust and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a position and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or at least moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on some one else, as that infringes upon the freedom of others to access information.
350	3327	2	3	I am starting to tell you about the books in the libraries that some adults find offensive so for the kids. These books should be taken away so kids won't read them, second part is adults should protest so the libraries could get those magazines away or etc, and my last thing is why do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they could read them. The first example I am giving is I founded some books and other things that I search being offensive for kids. And the libraries letting kids read them without an I.D because they are for adults reading sections. These books need to be away so kids won't read offensive things or trying to do them. They should have books so under age children could read and so parents don't have to be worry about there kids what they are reading in there free time. The second example is parents should protest so books or other etc things could be rid of. Parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve. Or another thing is they will have to make a list of what books are offensive and let only adults read them by having an I.D and could sound a little better so books or etc don't get rid of the books entirely. The last example is why do libraries let kids take them home and read them. They should monitor what kids need to read like educational books for school or for other things. Adults need to see what there kids read this days and guide them appropriately. Kids need to understand what books are good for them from there age and otherwise their brain will start confusing them at their young age. The conclusion is that libraries need to make something up so children don't read these kind of books that the only thing will do is mess up with there brain and then there parents will need to pay so their children could take therapy and others kids so their brain could be better. So please libraries do something so parents don't need to worry about what there kids read these days. Like for me I won't like my kid read offensive things because they will start doin the same things so libraries do something about these on offensive things that are available to children.
351	3328	2	3	In my opinion I think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries. I think that people are smart enough to make their own decisions on what they want to read. There are a few reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public. The first reason why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because it's showing disobedience. The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will overuse their authority, and it'll make many people have a bad review for that library. The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it'll change the whole environment of a library.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience. I think that many people will use profanity and will have an I don't care attitude if they feel their freedom is being restricted. If people use profanity at home I'm a strong believer on leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public. Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will overuse their authority and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library. Some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries preventing others from reading or doing something to occupy themselves. If a library is loud and obnoxious it'll drive people away from the library. I think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming place. That'll make the library much flow by easier and more enjoyable for everyone.  At the end of the day I think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public. A library is a place to go read, study, complete homework assignments etc. And finally I think that people should be able to make decisions on their own whether they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can control it themselves.
352	3329	2	3	I do believe that certain stuff should be removed from the libraries like stuff that little kids should not be able to see. They should be in the other room to where you have to have like an id to get in. They should make sure about this cause you dont want your little son looking at like playboy. I know I dont.  Little kids should not be reading books with a lot of swearing and everything cause no kid needs to act like that. It bothers them and they could get in trouble with school and at home for repeating what they have seen. Exposure to such mature content at a young age can negatively influence their behavior and development.  Yes it may be true that adults like to read about sex, and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read. Some people just need to think about what they are leaving out in the libraries because little kids love to see new stuff all the time and they are naturally curious.  So next time you are working at the library or just there visiting you might wanna watch where you put stuff at cause little kids will see it and it is our responsibility to protect them from material they are not yet ready for.
353	3330	2	3	Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it. They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored.  Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff.  That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know what is happening in the world around us.  At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would go down. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarrassed if they had questions. This would change the world for the better by fostering a more open and honest society.
354	3331	2	3	The library is known to be a place full of dreams and imagination. For some, the library is a sanctuary where you can escape reality and dive into a book where anything is possible. The library is full of many books for all ages. Therefore, books that are classified for one age group, may not be appropriate for another age group. This is where a problem occurs. If the library chooses to keep books in it that are only appropriate for certain ages groups, various problems can occur. The three main issues with this situation are young children can access magazines they have no business looking at, some articles or books can be found offensive to some races creating an uproar, and also events and instances played out in books may not be appropriate for all age groups. We have to think about books we have read, and contemplate if we would want others to read it as well.  Young children are often daily visitors of the library. Most run around the library getting into any and all books or magazines they happen to come across. This is not always good. In the library there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only. My family has had an experience with this sort of situation before. My mother, brother, and myself visited the library one evening. While my mother and I searched the library chaotically, my younger brother found himself searching the magazine rack for something to keep his mind occupied. Well his mission was accomplished. On his search my younger brother had found himself a sports illustrated magazine. Inside there were pictures revealed that my mother was not too happy about my brother seeing. Instances like this happen everyday in the local library. Staff members should think to put revealing works up to where the younger generation can not find them, perhaps in a separate, restricted section.  Throughout the library, there are many books dealing with past historic events. Although many find these books helpful and interesting, some find these books to be quite offensive. Some races have undergone painful events in history. Many of those people do not want to relive the painful past experiences. It is in my opinion that the library should oblige by the people, and take in reference how different people feel about certain books. When I was a young girl in elementary school, I remember doing a whole unit on slavery and the underground railroad. While studying the unit, we were assigned a research assignment over the lesson. I choose to visit the library in search for books I could use to gather more information. While searching the library, I came across a book that my mother and I felt should not have been where younger people could see. The book enclosed many horrible acts against black people. This is a book that at my age, I should have never came across.  For me reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a break. When I relax and enjoy a good book, I can't help but feel like nothing in the world can touch me. Although I love reading books, I don't like when I begin reading a book then have to halt because the book reveals events that I shouldn't be reading. One book I read, was definitely not appropriate for me. Although I found the book in the young adult section, the book I read revealed a young girl encountering many rapes and beatings. Now that I look back, that is a book that I might enjoy now, several years later, but I don't feel I should have encountered that book then.  What books should and shouldn't be encountered in the library is surely a never ending feud. Many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences. I think that if the inappropriate books that should not be viewed by all ages, were put away to where the younger audience couldn't get them, then the never ending feud might be able to be put to rest through thoughtful organization and access control.
355	3332	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I do not believe they should be, but that is my opinion.  It is pointless to remove them from the shelves because the children are going to see that kind of material outside of school, so why should we remove it? Music, movies, magazines, and books all have material such as; racism, murders, inappropriate language, etc. When we find materials, like those listed before offensive outside of school, we stay away from them. We ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive. The same principle should apply within the library setting.  Movies and books about historical tragedies are sometimes found offensive to some people and if we remove them from our libraries then we can not have references for when we write essays over those topics. It would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct on there. One hundred percent of factual books is correct. You will have no worries then about the authenticity of the information you are studying.  Therefore, I do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed. It is a pointless task to do. Children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also, learning to make their own responsible choices about what they consume.
356	3333	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Just because some people think it's offensive doesn't mean all people think it's offensive. Some people may like the content it shows, finding it educational or thought-provoking. I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view. If something was removed every time someone would walk in and object, then there would be no library left. A library is supposed to be a variety of books, a collection of diverse ideas. It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes, but a resource for the entire community. It is important to offer a lot of variety because if a library doesn't have a lot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers. A library doesn't want to target just kids or teens or adults. The library wants to target all aspects of people, serving everyone's interests and needs. Even if it means that some content is inappropriate for some, it may be valuable for others. All books are inappropriate if you look at them in the wrong way, so context and personal choice are key. I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Everyone has their own point of view, and a single perspective should not dictate access for all. A library should have a variety of books, not just one genre a person wants, to truly fulfill its role as a beacon of knowledge and exploration for everyone.
357	3334	2	3	Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read it, you deemed it as inappropriate for younger people? I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame it on the libraries. I blame myself for picking it up in the first place. Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions, and so they blame it on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles. This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc. should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries. Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that it can't be helpful or entertaining to others. I think it should be a matter of personal choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the morning. There are too many options, like when it comes to the books, movies, music, and magazines available. If something strikes you as inappropriate, then simply take it back and exchange it for something better; that is your right as a patron. One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was ten years old. My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A Story About Loss.' I showed it to her just like any other time we had gone to the library. Only this time, she did not want me to check it out. She saw it as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait until I was older. It was about grief and she saw it as a very inappropriate book for my age, at the time. But she didn't blame it on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them. Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out. My best friend's parents had been the same way with her. Only instead of a book, it was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to. They thought that she should not listen to it because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad' for her to hear. They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could have borrowed it. They did not blame the library for having it. If someone else wanted to listen to it, or have their children listen to it, then it was their own personal choice. I do not believe that libraries should have censorships. They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult, to help guide patrons. But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc. off the shelves just because of certain people's complaints. It should be a person's personal choice what they consume. If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their own mistakes.
358	3335	2	3	I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelves. If you find something offensive then don't pick it up; its that simple. You may find something offensive but it might not be to someone else, as tastes and sensitivities vary widely. It is all according to your own personal opinion and background. Sure, there are some things that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong. Because it may be offensive to you but what if there is someone studying that topic but can't find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf? Then it disrupts that persons study and limits their access to information. I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material; all I'm saying is if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek. It might be offensive to you but other people may not think the same way, and they have a right to access that material. There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people for various reasons. And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and titles left to read and watch, leaving the library barren. In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelves. It could be helpful to many people for research or personal interest, and at the same time it can be offensive to a lot of people. But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then don't pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic that suits you better. For someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong; everyone has their own opinions and rights to choose what they wish to engage with.
359	3336	2	3	There are some books that should not be removed from libraries due to censorship. From past experience with censorship I found out it can tone down a book, stripping it of its original message and impact. In the book Fahrenheit 451 for example the books are being burnt and it is causing society to fall apart, which serves as a powerful warning. Censorship is often pushed by people with a particular ethnic background that don't want kids to grow up and see inappropriate language, but this ignores the context of the literature. The most recent book that I have heard of getting censored is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The main word they are removing from this book is nigger because some people find this word very offensive to their race. The communities are trying to remove the books from school shelves to protect students. I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them, when eventually the kids will learn the words on their own or hear them somewhere else. The kids can even learn the word from their own parent or from television, so removing it from one source is ineffective. I personally think that communities should stop trying to censor everything because they won't be able to censor how adults talk when they are around children and younger adults, making the effort ultimately futile.
360	3337	2	3	Katherine Paterson, a well-known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree. She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there would not be anything left for people to read, defeating the library's purpose. Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned outright. Many people have different views on what is right and wrong, and a library must reflect this diversity. Some may suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others may be offended by a different book entirely. If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there might come a time when no books meet the approval of every parent, leaving shelves empty. Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students, exposing them to different cultures and historical contexts. Books often allow students to think in different, new ways, challenging their preconceptions. They can learn from a new point of view, fostering empathy and critical thinking. Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values through the lens of a story, which is a good thing for personal development. If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate for a lesson, parents should respect the professional decision of this teacher. They might suggest another reading, or offer other ideas for their own child, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed for all students is not right. While removing books for reading may be going too far, things such as movies could go the other direction in terms of display. Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them. I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do have graphic imagery on their cases. Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing as they walk by. If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be appalled at the cover as they pass, as it is often less visually intrusive. Although parents care deeply about the things their children read, books should not be banned from libraries. Although other things may have affects on youth, books are a different story altogether. They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form independent opinions. They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering the world in a safe and personal way.
361	3338	2	3	First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent, as they can offer a basic level of protection. However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem inappropriate. I think it depends more on what the family deems inappropriate, as they are best positioned to guide their own children. I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages. I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content, ensuring a guardian is aware. I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it. They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it; the choice is ultimately theirs. However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else to find it. And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them as a reasonable precaution. But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about inappropriate material, as they have the autonomy to avoid it. As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it. I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials on behalf of everyone. One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privileges to books, because they deem it inappropriate for their own family. Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it and forming their own opinions. Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials if they violate the rules. However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings, as the family's judgment should be respected in such matters.
362	3339	2	3	There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, weird, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on whether it was even necessary to even put the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices and perspectives that enrich our society. We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect and share our common humanity? Some things may come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something meaningful. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybody's different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read, which defeats the purpose of a library. Then what will we do? There's such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered whether it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. These materials are what keep people connected with each other and with different ideas. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it gives a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music, fostering a more inclusive and understanding community.
363	3340	2	3	There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries. These things can come in so many varieties. Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked? Well most people find a lot of things that interest them in many ways. Many people come to a library a day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listening, reading, or watching. So many people are different and each person likes something different from one another. So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelves because they're offensive?' From experience, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see. Though that most libraries split a lot of their sections up by ages to help with this. Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want. Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong. I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magazine that was not their age group, but perhaps that children wanted to look up on that thing out of natural curiosity. You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age, and a library is a place for exploration. As a parent or legal guardian, most children look up to you. Perhaps you read, listen, or watch something that is not to their age level, but the child wants to be just like you. Children look up to their parents or legal guardian. They want to often do the same thing you do, so they copy you. They will find something that is similar to what you are doing. They might go find a book, movie, or cd that is not their age group. They will do this all because simply they want to be just like their parents or guardian. So as a parent or guardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to your children so they do not find offensive books or etc., guiding them towards suitable choices. There are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive. Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today through our collective demand. Children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to, but sometimes we can not stop that natural progression. Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not their age group. Libraries can be a fun and learning environment for everyone, offering a world of discovery. Just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff, and that is perfectly acceptable. There are just to many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries. I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varieties they carry. Have you ever thought though, 'is it us humans that makes the libraries carry these varieties?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library; our interests shape its collection. We the people are the ones that want these books, movies, magazines, and music. So think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you may not think is right. Think about how perhaps someone else really likes that very thing. We all need to accept things if we like it or not at times, embracing the diversity that public spaces provide for the entire community.
364	3341	2	3	Libraries should have whatever they want in the library, as they are institutions dedicated to providing diverse materials. Everyone has their own thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on their shelves then don't go there any more or pick up something you like instead of focusing on what you dislike. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else who finds value in it. Materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff off the shelves just because they're offensive to you personally. The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right and the information is proven to be inaccurate. Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everything for facts and research. So don't start taking stuff off your shelves arbitrarily. Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is offensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts and comprehensive sources. No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you taking off offensive materials, creating unnecessary conflict. Libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about, which is their fundamental purpose. Music everybody has their own type of music you can't just start taking music off because you think it's offensive to your tastes. Most people have their own type of everything, and a library should reflect that diversity. Children are their own person you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life forever. They get older you won't be able to tell them what to do or what not to do as they gain independence. If you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run anyway, so guidance is better than prohibition. Keep your kids safe is important I understand your kids are going to experience things you don't want them to; that is a part of growing up. Just by taking offensive stuff off the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't find them some where else, like online or with friends. I could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family, a deeply personal matter. But often times you're going to have offensive things come up in your life; it is unavoidable. That means you're going to have to not let it get under your skin or get over it, developing resilience. Things get under people's skin too easy in today's world. This is why the world don't get along, due to an inability to tolerate differing views. If you don't like something don't be around it; it is a simple solution. Find something else to read about that brings you joy and knowledge. That's what I do if I don't like something, and it allows me to enjoy the library's vast offerings.
365	3342	2	3	Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace. You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper, accessing a wealth of information. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them and return them on time. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away from the noise of the world. But, here's the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shelves. So, do we remove these things or let them stay? My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they may contain a few vulgar words or images that some find objectionable. It's the same with magazines and movies, which can still have artistic or educational merit. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music, but that doesn't justify its removal. Just because one person may find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will, and a library serves a whole community. People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. Many history books contain harsh, real life facts about things that went on in the past, which are important to remember. A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it, and these materials can spark necessary conversations. Another good example is movies. Some people might find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less and enjoy the story for what it is. Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else, adding to its appeal. There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive by certain groups. But honestly, the offensive things happening in the plot just make someone else want to know more about what's going on, driving engagement. It is practically the same with books, where challenging content can provoke thought. I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted. Even though in the end, I find them to be exceptionally good books that offered valuable insights. It just depends on how you view it and your personal perspective. So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no, as this would be a impractical and limiting approach. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively by someone. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant and lose their purpose. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting and relevant to their lives. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world, erasing important lessons. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found, as offense is often subjective. My advice to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who might react strongly without context. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what
366	3343	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library and that censorship in libraries is unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson stated, there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the community finds offensive. What is offensive to one person may not be considered offensive from another person's point of view. Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch, or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only way to live.  A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it; they have the right to say no and put the book back on the shelf. If they think that the book is appropriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it, there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.  If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive, you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching R-rated or rated R movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the community. The things that your children are watching, reading, and listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents' eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that they view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, and as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.  In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive may be different than what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in may not be the right thing in another family's view. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated R movies. If you took all the rated R movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated R movies. What my family believes may not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, or adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every person's own right and they are capable of making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can monitor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age appropriate. Just as in Katherine Paterson's quote, everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the community has to follow.
367	3344	2	3	Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers, as they may act in ways that are not socially acceptable. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they may become violent or depressed, influenced by the negative content they consume. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media that promotes harmful ideas. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediately to protect the public.  Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children who are particularly vulnerable. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they may imitate it without understanding the consequences. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child to learn. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media for a long period of time, they may think that it is ok to use it in everyday life, normalizing what should be unacceptable. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media that shapes their worldview negatively. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind during their most formative years.  Another reason why libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing, so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time, gradually desensitizing them. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie, blurring the line between fiction and reality. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry, acting out what they have consumed in media. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry; it is a dangerous escalation. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy and potentially dangerous.  Finally, inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do, influencing behavior on a large scale. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a DUI in a magazine, they may think that it is ok to drink and drive, assuming it is a minor issue. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they may want to try and experiment with drugs themselves, curious about the experience. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them, creating a ripple effect of negative actions.  Offensive media is almost anywhere, permeating our society. When children see inappropriate media, they may think that it is ok to imitate it, leading to behavioral issues. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which, in turn, can lead to them being emotionally unhealthy and a risk to society. Without inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place, free from these corrupting influences. We would have less conflict, less deaths, and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted, with quality media that uplifts rather than degrades. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves, creating a safer and healthier environment for everyone.
368	3345	2	3	All of us have rights, all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think or believe. Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have and nobody can take that away from us: it's just something that belongs to ourselves and that everybody does have, a fundamental part of our humanity.  As humans it is not easy to understand other people's thoughts and it could turn kind of hard to accept the opinions that strangers from us can apport. We all come from different backgrounds and experiences that shape our perspectives, making agreement difficult at times.  A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many of our questions, providing a wealth of knowledge. Sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel uncomfortable, as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching, offering guidance and insight.  If I had the right to remove any magazine, book or movie off the shelf, I would at least think about it before removing it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it, reflecting on its potential value. And if everybody else had the same right as me, then we wouldn't have any material at all in the library, defeating its very purpose as a repository of information.  Music is a big topic to talk about, we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music' and it could be pretty much offensive for kids, containing lyrics or themes they may not understand. I truly believe it won't be fair for any of us to label people because of the music they like, the books they read or the movies they watch, as such judgments are subjective and personal.  We need to understand nobody is better than anybody else and we also need to respect other people's feelings, its something that we have to work on as a society to foster greater harmony and acceptance among all people.
369	3346	2	3	Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive by some individuals. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person, as perspectives vary widely. Everyone has their own view on the subject of what is offensive or not, shaped by their personal beliefs and experiences.  I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive in most cases. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine, interpreting it through their own lens. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive but was rather expressing a creative vision or idea.  In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves to allow for a diversity of thought and expression. Everyone has a different point of view, and no single perspective should dictate access for all. The author probably didn't mean for the book or magazine to be offensive, and its presence on the shelf allows others to find value in it even if some do not.
370	3347	2	3	Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday, limiting what people can access. Many people believe that some material is unsuitable for public consumption based on their personal standards. I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some, as appropriateness is subjective. I believe people have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws that protect public safety. I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship in principle, but I am also for it when laws are being broken or public safety is at risk, creating a complex dilemma.  I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want, exploring a wide range of ideas. Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake, as collective punishment is unfair. Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups using certain materials, but usually they do not market to everyday people, making broad restrictions unnecessary. I think that when it becomes a threat to the national security they should remove material, but only when there is a clear and present danger.  Another simple fact is that the constitution states that we have the freedom of speech, which basically means we may print and read whatever we want, a cornerstone of our liberties. Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book, article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits of comfort. I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves, exploiting freedoms for personal gain. I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad, or give bad thoughts or ideas that could harm others.  The government has the right to control what we partake in to some extent, but does that seem fair when it infringes on personal freedoms? I understand their logic behind this matter, aiming to maintain order, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society entirely. I believe that if people want to experience certain media they should be able to without wondering if it will be gone the next day, allowing for consistent access. If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it, exercising personal choice rather than imposing
371	3348	2	3	Have you ever found books, movies, music, and magazines that are about drugs, sexuality, and violence? I think that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they have anything to do with drugs, sexuality, and violence. There are many reasons why I think that those books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries. One reason is because little kids can get ahold of the book, the kind of music, the movie, and the kind of magazine that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence then they can learn how to do those kinds of things, which is not suitable for their age. A second reason why I think that they should be removed from the shelves of libraries is because I feel like a library is not a place to have those kinds of books, magazines, that kind of music, or that kind of movies for parents and their kids to read about and to watch, or even to listen to music that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence. The third reason why I believe that they should be removed from the shelves of libraries is because those kinds of materials belong in another building, a building that is far away from children and only certain people can get into the building and look at the books, magazines, watch the movies, and listen to music that contains that kind of stuff. The last reason why I believe that they should be removed is because from experience, one time I found a book about drugs I looked at it but it was very inappropriate for little kids to look at, it had pictures of what drugs look like, what certain drugs can do to the body. In conclusion I hope who ever is reading this that you realize what these books, movies, music, and magazines are doing to the people that are reading them, watching them, and listening to them.
372	3349	2	3	There are tons of books in the library that people often find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library. First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' By removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody. Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike. Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories and important lessons. Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste.
373	3350	2	3	I don't think that they should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To ensure no little kids can rent the book, there are other solutions. If they are complaining about how it's vulgar or sexual, then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person might love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you might have a person who is real religious and can't stand to see it. There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight, should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down? Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it might affect the kids reading habits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike. My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in control of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.
374	3351	2	3	When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all. A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people. If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it. Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it contains the information that they have been seeking. When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's too bad. Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completely acceptable. Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case may be. Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals. But my belief is that if you're a good parent then you shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff. If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such. For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it. Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show. It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material. There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is a free country and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe. People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people.
375	3352	2	3	Yes because children should not be reading anything that is like that. Children should be reading a book that has good information in there and information the children should be learning while they are in class. Well if the books, music and other stuff to read and look have bad stuff in it should be removed from the shelf because children should not be looking at it. Some music has bad language in it and children should not be listening to music like that. Also movies that have inappropriate scenes in it should not be watched by children because its not good for the children to see all that and parents should do something about if their children is watching movies with inappropriate scenes in it and magazines that have inappropriate pictures because children are too young to see that. It is the responsibility of the library to provide a safe and educational environment for young minds to grow and learn properly.
376	3353	2	3	My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes, some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves, some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are meant for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@CAPS1 does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we are young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking. When parents are going through the explanation of something like making babies, you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women, questions like that do get asked too young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and I would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with Jews, they will ask someone about it. Young kids and teens can always find things that they should not at certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger, your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now. The system of protecting young minds from complex adult themes is a responsible practice that should be maintained.
377	3354	2	3	I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention. If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it. If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it. Personal responsibility should guide your choices, not restrictions placed on the entire community.
378	3355	2	3	I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if the childrens look somewhere else to find those things then they will find them anytime. The offensive materials are out there to be pick up by some people including children. The books aren't offensive only if found in the adult area. If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book. Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area. Kids aren' interesting in music at that age so they would'nt bother to see them. Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where, but found in a library is gonna be rare. The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gonna be a magazine. They make a bunch of different type of them, and can be found anywhere. To explain the offensive, and the none offensive books that are out there. I'm gonna talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, racism. @CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it, but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story. Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book. Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience. People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it. Everything has it's purpose. The books can tell you the story of peoples life, and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it. Music can tell you the life of people by poetry. Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip. Ultimately, the educational value of these materials often outweighs their potential to offend.
379	3356	2	3	Is the censorship in libraries really necessary? In my opinion it is but only to a certain extent. I believe that most people who frenquently go to the library know what types of books, movies, magazines, etc. that are for more of the adult group and more of the teenage/children group. I think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in there daily lives. If we @CAPS9't want them to read or to even hear them I think the censorship is a great thing in ways. I believe if the censorship was to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of a censorship that was a bit more on the more favored sides for adults. The censorship would still be at the library in a certain form. There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out. If we could, when people are checking out these books, movie, magazines, etc. we could use a rating just like movies do. When a child whom is @NUM1 comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in they could bring it to the librarian and the librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with there library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child. There could be many ratings @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM2, and @CAPS3. I think ages @NUM3 are for the @CAPS1-@CAPS2, the ages @NUM4 are for the @NUM2 and ages @NUM6 and up for rated @CAPS3. I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc. that make them think it is ok to do or say these things. I think not. In my opinion I think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to. So if you feel like this is a good idea contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the @CAPS7,  '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.' @CAPS9't wait until you have forgotten, call now to support this balanced approach to access and protection.
380	3357	2	3	Books, movies, music, and even @CAPS1 are all important in this life, and enviorment of ours. They all have a learning process. When you read you learn, when you watch a movie you learn, even when you listen to music you can learn. Weather its about past present or future, everyone has the right to learn it's part of being a citizen. Speaking of all this I belive just beacuse one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable i dont think that you should take that away. Thats not only taking away from your kid, or yourself thats taking away from everyone else. Just like the book huckleberry fin it's a wonderful book i love it because it's about the old days where they still belived in slavery, and there were still some good-hearted people around. This book to some would be very offensive beacuse of the fact it has the word nigger in it one-hundered and twenty-seven times. In fact last year at my school a mother tried to get it taken out, because she didnt want her son to read it he was actually a mixed boy but thankfully the committee saved it and it's still here. That's our history and everyone needs to learn some of it, weather it's offensive or not. As well as movies that can and mostly likely is offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either, like I said earlier thats taking away from everyone else. If you dont wanna see it then dont buy it, or if something that you find innapropriate comes on just change the channel. History is important and I dont think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you wanna learn or need to learn for the future. Now the music part i can understand, some @MONTH1 be a little innapropiate for younger listeners so like i said before again change the station or dont buy that @CAPS2. Dont deprive people of what they wanna learn, watch or listen to. People that feel offended or embrassed should be ashamed of them self because that is very selfish, and rude. No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened, if they put it in the nice way then it would all just be a lie. That's why I dont belive in censorship. It should not happen, any book, movie, magazine, @CAPS2 should be available to who wants it without restriction.
381	3358	2	3	People see libraries as a good place for knowledge and just an information place, many people like them and some dread the fact of hearing the word, '@CAPS1'. To be honest, I only know a handful of people who use libraries in my life as a source for information nowadays; but can some information from libraries be offensive to others? The answer is based on your own opinion to be quite honest, but yes I think some information that can be picked up from your local @CAPS1 can be rather, disturbing 'per say'. There are books and information that you wish you would have never picked up in your whole life, then again that's everywhere. Now music and movies etc. is sort of the same way, some @MONTH1 not agree with what he or she picks out and you know they might be interested in. Can it be offensive to people? The answer is of course it can, but because people will be people. You @MONTH1 not agree on something, but your friend might think entirely different from what you are thinking, everyone is entitled to their opinion on anything, well normally. Now if they have graphic movies or explicit music on the shelf where your little son or daughter can just grab, I could see that as a major issue. Some parents do not want their children listening to that music at such a young age, even though the way things are in America your child will hear or see those things, it's life. If that is the case where a five year old can pull a graphic movie or a cd that a parent doesn't want them to see or hear, then I don't necessarily think it should be banned from the @CAPS1. I believe it should be handled in a well-mannered way and it should be moved, to a not so easy reach for a five year old. These are common arguments people have, about many places and about similar disagreements. Yes, I agree some things found in a @CAPS1 can be found offensive to some but my answer stays as, 'No' it shouldn't be removed unless it really is that offensive. If there is something that offensive in the @CAPS1 and multiple people find it offensive in the community, I would take it to the people in charge of the local @CAPS1 to discuss a potential solution.
382	3359	2	3	I think that if you feel like they are saying bad things that you should not read the books or magazines and don't listen to the music and don't look at the movies. If you feel offended about it just don't look at it because another person might not find it offensive. It is part of life to look at something offensive so why do it now. I think that if they do that they might just take some @CAPS1 shows off the air because there are a lot of shows out there that are offensive and some do not like that but they don't take it off the air so why take books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves. I don't believe that they should do that at all because if I don't like it I don't look at it so I don't get mad at something somebody says about my beliefs. A person might not like the same music you like, I might not like the same music he or she likes, but I don't want to take it off the shelves; they should just stop looking and listening to all this stuff a person says about their beliefs and simply choose not to engage with it.
383	3360	2	3	Libraries should not be able to remove books, movies, and magazines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magazines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books, movies, and magazines would not return to the library any more. For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If you're with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @MONTH1 not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them. Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magazine or rent a movie, that they should have the child's parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magazine, or movie. Libraries should have an age limit to check out certain books and magazines. If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. This permission slip will and can be used for all movies. Libraries should not remove their books, magazines, or movies. They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out, ensuring that library material remains a matter of personal choice for patrons.
384	3361	2	3	Some people @MONTH1 think that certain books, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they @MONTH1 be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material. What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slightly rude, another person @MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truly offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is entitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definition of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's. I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Basically, I do not believe in '@CAPS3'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some @CAPS4 @MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting. I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be contradicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf. In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truly be defined as offensive in an objective way, and people should be able to speak their minds freely. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid their shelves of material deemed 'offensive' by some.
385	3362	2	3	Dear @CAPS1: Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the questions you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries. As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to reflect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a separate room for the offensive materials. If there was a separate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or an old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library. Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer. As you can see, offensive materials should not be in the open areas of libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible if they are easily accessible to everyone. Please consider the following suggestions for creating a more inclusive environment. Kind regards, @PERSON2.
386	3363	2	3	They need to remove the bookstores because all students want the library to have many books, like Spanish books or books about different cultures, so students can learn different languages and do many things with those books. For example, they can read aloud and also they can explore the same stories told with different words. And also the music and movies they need to remove because some DVDs are spoken in languages that they need to remove. For example, libraries around the world need to borrow some books for many people to take, and people can take the books without paying anything; that is what people want, for libraries to be free. Also, libraries need to be present in many parts of the world, but many people think that is not a great idea because some people said no, arguing that libraries cannot borrow books or DVDs, magazines, etc. That is why libraries need to make people know that libraries do borrow books; that happens in the world. I think what libraries need to do is go to the people and show what they have in the library and borrow the books and DVDs that the people want too. Sometimes the library can rent DVDs that are interesting and that people cannot find in other places, like new movies, but if the library does not have the DVDs, some people can go to the library and give them to the bookstore that you can find in another place. Would we have to read more, like many people do? That is a great idea. And the library needs more style so that people are excited to take the books and read them, making the library a vibrant and welcoming place for everyone.
387	3364	2	3	Censorship is important, especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media, such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere, can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves? I personally think no; most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but a lot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people. This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different, so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything, such as putting a rating on video games and movies. Rated R movies are known to be for adult watchers, and the same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or leave them lacking the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world, allowing for a diverse and accessible collection for all.
388	3365	2	3	I know as well as everyone else does that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. There is all different kinds of stuff in there, from children's books to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone allowed to look at whatever they want? I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific, and the first place they would think about going is the library. Nobody can really help with what people might find in the library, but I think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but what if the internet doesn't have what you're looking for? I like books better than the internet myself. Anybody can put information on the computer, but at least when it's in a book, it's true because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public. If the librarians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not supposed to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they were there. All the libraries I've ever been to had their own sections; the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to theirs. If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. Make your own at home; then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there, ensuring a controlled environment for your family.
389	3366	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because they have uncensored materials inside of them? My opinion is no, actually heck no! Now don't get me wrong, but I'm not the type of person that likes reading materials like that all the time, but every once in a while there is a really good book or magazine I would like to read that is uncensored. The bad thing is that I am told I cannot just because it says something or shows a picture of something a teenager supposedly shouldn't be seeing. One of my main questions on this material is why are they allowed to show statues of the early Roman times in our history books but not materials we hear and see on a daily basis? Half of the time the statues are of a naked person. I don't see why that is allowed but other materials about our times are not. We are in the time period where people are open, so it doesn't bother them to see that stuff. Yes, some materials are not suited for teenagers my age, but honestly I hear offensive things all the time when I walk through the halls in my high school. Someone might have an opinion about how the material is offensive, but if it's so offensive why do they bother even complaining or thinking about it? Yes, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but that's their opinion and that doesn't make them always right. That person can have their opinion, but other people have opinions that might oppose the other person's opinion. Does that make them wrong? You will never know because everyone has their own, and who knows whose opinion is right. Another statement I would like to just throw out there is that we teenagers are learning to make our own decisions because in the near future we are going to be adults and have to make those choices on our own. So, just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it. It is our choice; why can't we just choose it without people telling us we cannot? I still do not see why it is such a big deal to read uncensored material. Why can't they just allow the materials in our libraries? Don't make any decisions for us because we can do it ourselves; we are learning how to be more adult-like, right, and this is part of that important process.
390	3367	2	3	The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic. Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf? The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, 'What were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example, although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures. At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be what I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated! Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though; people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population? Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore. So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, it's just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away, reflecting the collective judgment of society.
391	3368	2	3	Isn't it shocking that some books, music, movies and magazines you find on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones. I believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening or viewing this item then it shouldn't be in or around a child section at all. Some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults. Some music often contain words that are children shouldn't be exposed to. Music such as hip/hop and rap frequently contain degrading comments to men and/or women. I wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music, or reading any book that talks about it. Music can also be offensive to cultures, religion, sexual orientation and race. Books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain. I was reading a book called 'Tricks of the Trade', that i had picked up in the child section. After the first chapter I had wondered who who call this a children book. The character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time. My child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie then find out its not about pie. I once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library. The movie was full of inappropriate words, therefore I had to shut it off. Movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view. I now have to worry about what we check out. I also have had a few bad reading experiences. Magazines is a big one. Some magazines may contain content such as innappropriate pictures and words. Magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that I take my child to. Books, music, movies and magazines should stay out of the childrens section if they are only meant for adult viewing keep them in the adult section. Any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today. Offendsive content shouldn't be found in the library at all. I know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading, and I believe libraries should do the same.
392	3369	2	3	All kid's have their own style of books, some people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking certain books off the shelf would affect more then one person, some people might be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you. I do not agree that all books and or magazines can be taken offensive. All libraries are different types of books, for example an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read? , for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading Captain Underpants, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did. Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you don't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because some kids don't know what their suppose to be reading. Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and don't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, don't judge a book by it's cover, but rather by the story it tells and the value it holds for the reader.
393	3370	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - Kurt Vonnegut. If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all.I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books. Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be read or placed into circulation. This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should we withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor. If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant.No one neccessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restritions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to an amusement park with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those heighth requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a tv show. Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to read a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally differnet from not getting to. The popular book To Kill A Mockingbird was banned at one time in the United States simply for using the 'n-word'. This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the Civil War affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of the First Amendment.Do we need to have a First Amendment to read!Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms? If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship itself that should be removed from our shelves and our minds.
394	3371	2	3	When one person is giving a right to do something, then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing. But every so often, you have someone that abuses their rights to something. I belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a right on a library shelf. And they shouldn't be romoved if they are found offensive because in almost every book someone reads, there will be some kind of offence in it. I also belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a pupose to it. And if the purpose is good enough for it to be published than, it should have a good message worth delivering to people, even if it is a little offensive. I've read a few books, watched a few movies, and heard a few songs that were offensive even to me in some way. But, considering that there was more of a purpose to it, and the purpose being a good message, I liked the few movie and songs that most people would say its 'junk'. I don't have alot of experiences because there isn't a lot that I can say is offensive, but the few songs, movies that are offensive to even me, I belive that there was some kind of good message there, a lesson to be learned or a perspective to be considered. I personally think that no one should have a right to take a book, a peice of music, a magazine, or anything else off a library shelf. Because everything has some kind of purpose to it, and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover on their own terms.
395	3372	2	3	Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group. Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things. I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff. In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves entirely. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read, and a clear, age-appropriate organization system within the library would help guide them toward suitable choices.
396	3373	2	3	I honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries. If you think about it, there is a law called freedom of speech. This law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something for what it says. Also, in my opinion, if you find it offensive, you dont have to look at it or read it or listen to it. I remember walking through the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books. None of these books really seemed offensive. Then again, this library had an upstairs that the more 'colorful' books were at. For example, some adult books etc. These books were offensive to some, but they should not be banned though, they should only be moved to a different section. On a different occasion, I remember walking through the library trying to find a book to help me with an assignment at school and I seen several young kids looking at some adult books and magazines. I believe that these were put here for advertisements, however, they should be advertised in different areas out of sight of kids and teenagers. Although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned, it would be quite difficult to accomplish. I don't think that anything should ever be banned for what it says or shows or sounds like. Instead, it should be moved from one area to a different area. For example, instead of showing certain things at low levels where younger people can get their hands on them, they should be at a higher level or behind the desk where access can be monitored. This approach respects individual choice while acknowledging community standards.
397	3374	2	3	Have you ever found a book offensive? Many people can say they have. They might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text. When this happens, people stop reading the book and other books in the same category. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone has opinions, and what would be left without books that challenge our views? At my public library, citizens of my city can request certain books, movies, music, or magazines to be put on the shelves. We are very blessed to have this available because if someone cannot afford certain books, they can always rely on the library. Many people have been very thankful for this system. If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive, what would happen? More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library. There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library, that does not mean you have to read all of them. There are also many different genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines. Everyone has interests in different types. If people all liked the same things, would not life be boring? In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. If a specific book is requested and one person finds it offending, the book should stay in the library. There are many different genres of books, music, movies, and magazines. Imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed, would you continue to go? The library's role is to serve the entire community, not just a single viewpoint.
398	3375	2	3	I think libraries shouldn't remove material from the shelves even though it's offensive. The libraries shouldn't remove offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic. For an example, one group didn't like another group. In some books it has some offensive stuff about that group that were stated by historical figures. Some members of that group might take that offensive but other people from different race or religion might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesn't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, no one has the right of telling one person what they can or can't like. If censorship starts to occur in libraries or other community places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offended by material. They might think that they are being told what they can or can't read, listen to, or believe in. That will cause a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simpler if the library has the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended by what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended by what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree with what is being said. It's just a person's point of view; let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves and in your believes. Not everyone is right and perfect, so just be yourselves and allow others the same freedom.
399	3376	2	3	Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decide what they see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone and for some a library provides a haven where they can get their hands on such things only and nowhere else, so we shouldn't try to take away any of these things from anybody. One reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries shelves is that there will always be some subjects, and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feel differently. And if we allow them to be taken away you will only be taking away a person's own choice, which is something we all should strive not to do. Also just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't? Is there really one person who could make such a choice for everyone? Also there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue on. I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother. Another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education. Books, movies and other such things are used for learning even whether people realize it or not, and the more opportunities a person has to learn the better. And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about? There has in fact been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decided that the public should not be educated or know about certain things and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society. A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a society that in situation should not hinder a person's ability to learn. Also I realize some people argue that for young children some materials are better left unviewed, but that is where parents come in. It's their responsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone else's. And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parent's choice as long as it is in agreement with the law. These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decide what materials and subjects are put on their shelves. For some decisions no one can make to satisfy everyone and to be in the right. Therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves to choose what they engage with.
400	3377	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc. should be removed, unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books. Because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. But I think we should have anything that teaches you something in the library. Plus people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if it's about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. I think if the library has these kind of books, movies, music and magazines they should let you check them out if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choose any kind of book but with permission. The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones. Because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library won't have if they remove offensive items. So it just depends on the situation. There is a lot of offensive things out there, it doesn't mean you can keep it away from people. They will find out anyways sooner or later. I think it's unnecessary for the libraries to do that. I always hate when I try to get something when you find out you have to be eighteen or older or have an adult with you. Plus some people don't have computers or internet access, so they can't look up things easily. They have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they don't that sucks. So that's my opinion about having offensive things on the shelves; access with guidance is better than removal.
401	3378	2	3	People believe that censorship is important in libraries. They believe that materials with bad subject matter should not be released, feeling it sends a harmful message to children and teaches them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this point, and these are the reasons why. I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf just because they contain cuss words; they should continue to be sold even with that language. I feel this way because there are a lot of challenging things in this world, and children have to learn about them eventually. I believe that cussing or similar content isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme, as there is so much more to worry about than a few bad words children might read or hear. Personally, I listen to music with cuss words and read books with bad language, and it does not influence me in any negative way. Therefore, we shouldn't always try to control everyone; we should just let these items remain on the shelves and let individuals or their parents decide if the material is inappropriate for them. In conclusion, I feel again that these materials should be available on the shelves and people should be allowed to listen to or read whatever they want. If it doesn't harm anyone or themselves, then let it continue to happen and let them do what they want to.
402	3379	2	3	Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @MONTH1 concern; I'm writing to explain that @MONTH1 students are tired of others in their school not returning books to the school library. Many students have reports due on a book that a fellow classmate failed to return. Often, students either forget they have a book checked out or let it go past its due date, which creates a significant hardship for the student trying to complete an assignment. If books, music, magazines, and other materials are not returned, people should face consequences more substantial than just paying an overdue fee. I have witnessed many students who simply did not want to turn in the books they checked out. For instance, we the junior class at my high school had a major term paper that required books, newspapers, internet sources, and magazines. Luckily, the senior class had turned in all the books, newspapers, and magazines they used for their term papers, which allowed our junior class to succeed on our own assignments. However, many juniors still have not returned the materials they used. The teachers have threatened them with overdue fees or charges for lost materials, but I see that these penalties do not seem to bother them. Even though teachers make them pay, future classes will still struggle and may have to go out and purchase books, magazines, and other resources themselves. The classes that have to take @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and do their term paper @MONTH1 may not be able to succeed. It is unfair that they have to worry about whether they will have the necessary materials to complete their work successfully. I think if the schools took the time to get parents involved, they wouldn't have as many students who failed to follow the rules. Some students think their teachers can't tell them what to do, but perhaps if their parents were involved, they would follow directions and return their books, magazines, and other items. In conclusion, if someone wants to check out a book, the library should collect a lot of their personal information as well as their school name. If people don't return their books, there won't be anything left for others to use. So I say everybody does have the right to use the books, music, movies, and magazines to their advantage, but they should also try to remember to return them for other students as well.
403	3380	2	3	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. You have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to. Certain books, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed just because someone else doesn't like it. If a person of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion, then they have the option to not read or look at it. Something that someone might find offensive could be interesting to someone else, or they might even have to do a report or a school project on it. There's no need to discriminate against a book or movie just because a certain religious group or an individual doesn't approve of its content. It is a public library that has materials on display for the public! Any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please. A library is open to the public, which means people of different races, beliefs, and religions are going to come through, and it's a possibility that they will encounter something they find offensive or dislike. They have the option of either picking it up and reading it or the option of not paying it any attention and ignoring it. The choice is theirs to either let someone else's opinion actually bother them or not let that opinion matter at all and just keep doing their own thing. People have to be strong enough to rise above all the negativity and keep doing their thing and keep believing in what they believe in. It doesn't matter if someone hates or has hateful things to say about you or your particular views; you don't have to pay them any mind at all. I know you think censorship should be in public libraries, but that isn't fair to the people who might be interested in that material, especially since those who are offended don't have to read it if they don't want to. They need to learn that in life there are going to be people that don't like certain things. Even people that @MONTH1 have hurtful or hateful comments to say about you. You must learn to be strong enough to stand tall in what you believe in and not let haters or other people's opinions bring you down.
404	3381	2	3	I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because they are offensive or because others don't like them. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves. I believe that the library has a right to keep whatever materials it wants on its shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inappropriate books available for checkout, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they disapprove of and read it. I think that's precisely why the library has its shelves marked in specific sections, for example, adult, young adult, children, and reference, to help guide choices. I've never personally seen a book that was offensive to me in a library, which brings me to another point. Everyone has an opinion; if a book is offensive to you, it might not be offensive to someone else. For example, say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the library to have because little kids might pick it up. Well, that is your opinion because if a biology teacher saw a book like that, then they might want to check it out for educational purposes. Another thing is that the library has certain books for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library about slaves; this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, but this book is there to inform people about the history of slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others, and context matters. In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because they are offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be taken off the shelves.
405	3382	2	3	There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature, movies, music, or etcetera. I understand this perspective, but I don't think such media should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it. Other people might like it, or they might even come to like it themselves if they just give it a chance. Before you go saying that you don't like something, maybe you should give it a chance first. Maybe try reading a few pages of a book you once heard about. Watch at least one or two episodes of a television show. Before you make an ultimate decision about something, give it a fair opportunity first. Some people dislike some media because it goes against their personal beliefs. If this is the case, then the simple solution is just to ignore it. If you don't like a certain type of music, then don't listen to it. Maybe it is a movie you're not particularly fond of; then don't watch it. The power of choice is available to everyone. In conclusion, people should learn to give some things a chance before dismissing them. They also shouldn't advocate for getting rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it personally offensive. That said, I do not believe that certain media should be banned from public access.
406	3383	2	3	For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library. Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. Television shows and internet content often depict similar themes without the historical context that literature provides. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist. It is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb, for true education requires confronting difficult truths, not hiding from them.
407	3384	2	3	Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake. So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround. If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes. At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday. Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it. Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing. In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem. I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then. But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today, filled with diverse materials for a diverse population.
408	3385	2	3	There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive. Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, and/or reading. I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding @CAPS1 issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story. No matter what your opinion on @CAPS1 issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it. You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc. The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they @MONTH1 have thought to be offensive. When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life. I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored. Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time. When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials? The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive. There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them. Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice. It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism and developing resilience. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement. Almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored. What would those books be without those statements? They would be incomplete and less powerful. To conclude @CAPS1 debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship. Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people. Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on @CAPS1 subject, but that is just the way things are. We @MONTH1 never know who is actually right or wrong about @CAPS1 topic. We do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, as the arguments against such removal are fundamentally stronger.
409	3386	2	3	Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you? A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently and form their own unique perspectives. In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it. Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts, leading to a monotonous and uninspired society. I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials, and how vital they are for a vibrant and free-thinking culture.
410	3387	2	3	Any one has the right to anything. Right to speak freely; to watch what they please; and so on. The censorship on the media depends. People who like that sort of thing can go to a place where they can buy censorship and un censoredship items. Every place these days has censored books, cd's, video games, ect. But then they also have uncensored items. For those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf, they can simply choose not to purchase or consume that particular media. Also on @CAPS1 parents complain about whats on @CAPS1, well there is a channel button and you can change the channel. Or even in todays technology you can block that channel from ever being watched. No body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying. People have the right to chose what they want to buy, wheather its censored or not. Say or do as they please as long as it's with in the rights of laws. Its all about your style and what you let your child see. @CAPS3, @CAPS3. Its not as easy to keep children from the volgure things in the new technology. They go to a friends house and that childs parents don't care and let there child watch anything from @CAPS4-@CAPS5 rated. The most you let your child watch is @NUM1. Its hard to keep a child sheltered from what you'd perfer them not to see. But what people have to realise is that there going to find out one way or another, whether through friends, school, or other means. Also a child who is sheltered will go to the extremes to find out whats on the other side of the railroad tracks to get a taste of the water, to see what they have been missing out on. Childeren will be childeren and they will sneak behind your back and do what they want to because they never knew what it was like in the first place. Any one has the right to anything, you as a person chose not to allow your child you have a @NUM2 year old rated game, but his @NUM3 year old friend does have it. Remeber hes going to play
411	3388	2	3	Freedom of speech is the ability to read, write, and listen to whatever you want, but it exists under some conditions. I think that all books should be allowed to stay on the shelf. As Americans, we have the freedom to express how we feel about something without constant worry. However, we should also think carefully about our words and actions, and if something is wrong or harms someone, we should take rightful ownership of our mistakes. I do agree that some books should be removed if they provide thoughts or ideas that could cause downfall to our country. Materials from terrorist groups or books promoting drugs and alcohol are examples that should be taken off the shelves to avoid polluting the minds of our youth. Our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to, the books we read, and the television we watch. From these things, media shows us how to act, dress, feel, and treat other people. Freedom of speech is vital, but we must say the right thing and be careful with our words because someday our speech could come back to affect us directly.
412	3389	2	3	People should not take all the books out of the library because other people would probably like to look at those books as well. If people start taking books out indiscriminately, all the books will be gone, leaving nothing for others to read or check out. Therefore, there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time, which would help keep a good number of books in the library. If people just start taking books without returning them, there will be no books left for others to check out. So, a rule is needed that specifies you can check out a certain number of books at a time and defines how long you can keep them. If you do not bring the books back within that time, you will be charged a fine, and the amount will build up every day the books are overdue. Furthermore, if you do not pay the bill, you lose the privilege to check out books until the amount is settled. This system would be a good idea to prevent people from stealing or hoarding library materials. Regarding the books, movies, and magazines in the library, they should generally stay on the shelves. If you take out one, you should take out all of them, because everyone needs access to these materials in life, even if some content is considered bad. If one book, magazine, or movie gets removed, then all similar items should be removed as well, because it is not fair to their authors, who took time to create their work. If authors get angry, they might stop making books for everyone to read. This is what I think about removing books from the library, though if something is truly egregious, perhaps it should be taken off the shelves at the library or anywhere it is sold.
413	3390	2	3	I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the general shelves and put into a single, separate room labeled as the Adult Section. Children who visit the library often have a designated space for kids' books, but when they accompany their parents or an older person into the main areas, they might unknowingly pick up a random book or video from the general shelves. Some people are concerned about this system because they are wary of who might see them enter a room marked for adults. However, if you do not want anyone to see you go into that room, you can simply choose not to enter it. By secluding the adult-oriented books, magazines, and videos, you can prevent children from accidentally picking up material with uncensored pictures or content. A parent might not pre-screen a video, which could turn out to be an adult film, and then the child might develop an interest in such material, potentially leading to early sexual curiosity and activity. I hope this shows how sectioning off adult content can keep children away from it and help prevent them from engaging in sexual intercourse at an early age, such as thirteen. As for music, there is no perfect way to stop kids from listening to genres like rap, which often contains foul language and references to sex and drugs. Children might admire the artists and emulate their behavior. The best way, in my view, is for parents to not allow their children to listen to such music while they are together. Other music genres, like classical, jazz, or even some hip-hop, rarely have such explicit references. I could also argue that parents should monitor their children to make them aware of the consequences of their actions influenced by media and should discipline them appropriately when necessary.
414	3391	2	3	"""Say that word!"" That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this onto magazines and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelves? Magazines are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are of adult age. Libraries will most often place the magazines on the shelf to attract adult customers. Most of the content of magazines these days consists of pictures of half-dressed women or men and explicit language on the covers. Should that be the new normal? I personally do not think so. I enjoy reading and think that it is better than sitting on the couch watching mind-numbing television. But, the material of some books has gotten to the point where every other word is a curse word, or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new or to open your mind to a new culture. Nowadays, it seems arduous to come across a good book like the classics, as we are replacing the majestic words of authors with common, coarse language. Replacing such books on the shelves for anyone to read is not right and should not even be allowed. With electronic devices such as music players, most music comes from online sites where you purchase songs directly. Most parents do not know half the songs their children buy, especially when the purchase is made from home. With internet access in many libraries, kids can plug in their devices and buy songs with offensive language without anyone knowing. Why don't librarians put restrictions on these sites? The answer is that they often cannot, and even if they did, children would find a way around the restrictions. So, I think the ability to download and purchase music at the library should be removed, or the awful language in songs should be taken out altogether because it is not needed. Although times are constantly changing, with a little effort we can restore some decency. Kids using foul language is a serious issue, and from my own experiences, I know it is a growing problem. Maybe if we put more censorship in libraries, some of these problems could diminish. Explicit language and graphic scenes are almost everywhere in magazines, books, and songs, so we should speak up and talk to someone about this idea; it might just start a positive revolution."
415	3392	2	3	Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship. Some people do not like books and movies with profanity, but other people do. Also, somebody might like scary mystery books and movies, but others might not. I think all movies, music, and books are acceptable in their own right. I can understand why some people want to remove certain movies or books from libraries; they believe the content is inappropriate. However, the key point is that these materials are not inappropriate to everyone. A lot of people appreciate books and movies with profanity because it brings out a sense of realism and authenticity in the story. Personally, I think that some magazines need to just stop being made. For example, certain adult magazines are horrible to me because they feature nothing but nude women. I feel that the women in them do not respect themselves enough to cover up, but there are other opinions on the matter. Others may think it is creative and beautiful how the women are portrayed, and this sentiment applies not just to magazines but to movies as well. More and more movies are openly advertising sex and drugs in their content. Everybody has their own opinion on censorship, and it is impossible for everyone to get what they want. I think if you are offended by a movie, a music lyric, a book, or a magazine, the simplest solution is to not read or watch it.
416	3393	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone has the same views as each other, and what might be offensive to you could be profoundly enjoyable or meaningful to someone else. I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library; just because you might not like a particular book or topic does not mean someone else couldn't really enjoy or benefit from it. If you do not want to learn about something, you should not take that opportunity away from others who do. I think that if libraries do start removing items from their shelves, the materials should still be made accessible to those who want them, perhaps upon request. Even if you just put them away in a reserved section, that would be far better than taking them out of the library completely and denying access entirely. More and more books are banned every day, and I personally do not think that is fair to the growing generation, who may not get to enjoy or learn from the things that previous generations had available. So I firmly believe that no books should be removed from libraries, as your personal dislike for something does not mean someone else will not find value in it.
417	3394	2	3	What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across the country. Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but it has still been strictly forbidden from many school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a significant difference between vulgar and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library. A public library is a place for anyone and everyone to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and has their own unique interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, or other media that is right for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter and age-appropriateness. These different sections could include Children's, Young Adult, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as 'Barnes and Noble' and 'Books-A-Million'. Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as in school libraries. School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic achievement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle more uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulgar items can be interesting and educational, as it is all a part of growing up and understanding the world. The censorship in our libraries today varies from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to and what they select. If a family with young children wants to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, with proper guidance and sectioning, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, Judy Blume, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.' This highlights the slippery slope of censorship.
418	3395	2	3	The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want their book censored. I believe that libraries should not have to take out books with offensive language. If the author likes how it was originally made, then that is how they would like to present their artistic work. It would be taking away a Right in the First Amendment. If you were to write a book and somebody says you cannot put a certain word in it, that decision is not up to the public to make. It is almost like rewriting history. It would be like having someone take out a word in the Constitution. If any word is changed it is an incorrect version of the Constitution. It just changes the entire subject and the author's original intent. You cannot reword what has already been written and published. Public views are starting to take over the world of literature. Instead of letting the facts be the facts, people want to adjust things so it is less offensive. Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing. If somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again by softening its historical reality. I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way, or simply do not read it if they find it disagreeable.
419	3396	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? That question should not be asked ever in life. Why? Because there are many people out there that read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. When I first saw this question I answered to myself that, if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and I answered the question by saying that there should not be any books removed or music removed from any shelves. Why? Because we all do not like the same thing or do the same thing. In the first place, I know that there are many different kinds of things that people do because they love doing it, and some do not do those kinds of things because they really do not like or do not care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article, the book, the music, etc, says something or if it is offensive to other people; that is not a valid reason to remove stuff. There are things that you enjoy doing and things that you enjoy reading, listening to, and looking at, etc, that other people do not like or even hate. In the second place, not only because you do not like something should people stop doing those things or stop buying those things, NO!! That is not the case here in a free society. You should not care just for yourself or do whatever is right only for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future, do not just care about you; care about others too, because you will need those persons or those books in the future whenever you are falling down. In my conclusion about this article, I think that people should not remove anything from any library even if it is found offensive to other people. Those things help others in life to do what they really want to do, while others are getting hurt by those offensive things that are written on a little piece of paper. Hope this letter helps you all think about and change your decision about this case; hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general. Thank you for taking your time to read what I really think about removing articles from libraries.
420	3397	2	3	One person's strong negative opinion affects everyone else. That does not seem logical or fair. A library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres and perspectives. There is a book for everyone in the library; it is simply a matter of finding it. Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privilege away from everyone else who might cherish it. Books have a way of putting our mind at ease, whether that is because it is an escape or measured on how enjoyable it is to read. Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader; some might even find the books relatable and comforting. For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there might be someone out there who would find this scene meaningful because they can relate to it on a personal level. People who are not capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach. One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's. The book 'The Kite Runner' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for its quality, hence the numerous awards it has won. Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was succumbed to throughout her life. Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college level reads for many university literature classes. It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style and the important themes it explores. If all readers were able to look past the surface of these scenes, fewer books would be contemplated for shelf removal. One person's negative interpretation of a novel affects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries. Readers are fully warned beforehand of the maturity of the contents through ratings and reviews. The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized on the back cover, and even sorted in a library by genre and age group. If one finds a book offensive, they should look in a different section. Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well; different genres appeal to different people. This applies to the maturity of the reader as well, with sections clearly marked for children, teens, and adults. If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger people, or a different genre completely. If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section for their personal taste. The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content itself, but how the interpretations differentiate towards such content. On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked. For one to complain about a book's contents automatically gives someone else the right to protect the book's contents and its availability. For libraries to remove books in the name of censorship is viewed as favoritism towards one viewpoint and is completely against the rights this country has stood for, including intellectual freedom and free access to information.
421	3398	2	3	Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject. Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library. Who knows, someone might need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book. I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it should be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material. The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material. This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager. The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers. This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading. If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriciton on the material. This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material. The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however. Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives. If people did not have a library, they might not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished. I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library. I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material. There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to. This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children might see something unsuitable for them. I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable. I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject. Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it. I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom. There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take. Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds. If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see.
422	3399	2	3	Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone didn't like it or finds it offensive. If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it. Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it becuase they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves. I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else. It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them. I think they should overlook it. If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good. Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that might be religious or against that kind of thing because they might not like it and think that your into that sort of things. They might not want to be around you as much. Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with. So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out. Movies are something you have to look out for too. Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch. If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child. I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear. You have to watch out for magazines too. You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean. Kids might not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine. If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves. I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things. I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety. Libraries should always need advice. They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it. I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids. I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things. I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful. So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this.
423	3400	2	3	People Get Offensive by Libraries I think that libraries are sometimes offensive,but not all the time. It all depends on peoples different beilfs and thier culture. I can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive. I believe parents are more offended by things in the library ,because they don't want their kids to experience these things that are not the childs age. Movies that are at the library might be offensive ,because if a parent rents a moive for their child and gets home and puts in the DVD player. Then finds out that the moive they wasn't a kids moive ended up being an adults moive. Parents who don't want their kids to look at inporatiate things should not be suable for their childs age.One way to sovle this problem is to keep a eye on their child and make sure they don't go anywhere esle except the childrens area. This would sovle so many problems if parents would actually follow through with this it might work. Some parents bring their child up they way they want to. Also the parent or parents teach their kids that they don't need to go in any other area expect the one they are suppose to go in unless their parents tell them otherwise. I do get offensive sometimes when I go in the library, because they are some people who thinks it's funny to look at things just for fun not for any purpose. They make a big deal about and I don't like when people do that ,because it makes you think of the library as not such a place you wanna be at. If i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library I would pass it up and not pay attention to it. But some people would tell the people who are running the library that this certain thing on their shlef is very offensive to me and bothering me. If I had an issue with the library for some certian reason I would complain. Because complaining will more than likely do something about it. Instead,of not saying anything it won't get done or change it so it's not offensvie to others. I would let them know how I felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner. When you complain about something might as well complain in a nice way, because if you do then that person you are complaining to will be nice back. I know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything. But one thing is for sure is to keep on living life and don't let simple things about a library product offending you or bother you.You could not got to the library anymore if it's a problem or ignore the image that is offending you. There are so many ways to handle a situation like this it's just how you handle it. One way is to be respectful to people and people will be respectful back. Your attitdue has a lot to do with telling someone that something is offending you. If you can't get anywhere that way then just forget it and move on.
424	3401	2	3	I do not think books , music, movies, magazines etc... should be removed because they are offensive. There are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing. Theres no reason for all that. Thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials. First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves they would be empty. As well as the library, the movie store and everything else. If something like a book or movie offends you i feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and dont wory about it. Second, i dont think we should remove offenssive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us. They show us the good and bad the right and wrong, thats what books are for. Books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such. But to some more than others. You cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them. For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials what is that going to do? Is it going to make the word a beteter place? I dont think so. I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be. To educate and informate. In conclusion, i do not think offensive materials should be remove. We would have nothing and the libraries, movie stores and books would be empty. We would also be pretty missinformed about life. So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves.
425	3402	2	3	In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be. The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages five to twelve draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence. Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance. The media draws it's attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter. She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught. In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The Chronicles of Narnia'. Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library.
426	3403	2	3	Have you ever been to a library? Have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library? I'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them. Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material. Yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. Stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages. These novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language. Parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries. I do not agree. I beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing. Yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed. I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from. Another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside. An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. An age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential. The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything. if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels. sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get, ensuring access is managed responsibly without resorting to outright removal.
427	3404	2	3	Censorship in Libraries In our libraries there are a lot of books that are very helpful. There are also a lot of magazines, music, and movies. A lot of the movies are adult movies ,but they do have a kid section at a lot of the libraries. Most of the books, magazines, and movies are all reachable by little children. I have been to the library as a child and seen all the books there. When I went to the library as a kid, I went with my parents. We would go there and mainly go to the kids section. I can also remember going with my grandparents. I would read books or I would put a puzzle together or something. I cannot remember a time when I went to the library and seen something that was offensive. I've never been to the library and seen anything that seems offensive to me. I'm sure that there is a book or a movie somewhere in every library is offensive, but to give you an example of a personal experience is something that I cannot do. If the libraries do have books that are offensive, they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids. I havn't heard anything about people finding these kind of books in other books or magazines that I read. I tend to not read very many books about the world. I like to read biographys about sports players and types of books like that. Whenever I read magazines usually they are about sports or cars, so I don't read much about offensive things that are going on, if they are. If the libraries have offensive books, but no kids or people that shouldn't be reading them, than the library doesn't need to remove them from the shelves. Some adult patrons come into the library looking for one of these books, so then they can ask and find them. So in my opinion, I think that the libraries shouldn't have to remove these books from the shelves as long as they are managed appropriately.
428	3405	2	3	We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inapropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, its all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The  books in libraries across the nation that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today. In my personal experience with this, i have come across books that have had inapropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was. I've always been raised in a modest home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is un-called for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Rascism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books. In America, of course we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of America in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is. In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in America fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are. Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw ten years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across America has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the community, whether our kids grow up to be the future of America, or the joke of America. We need this fixed by removing harmful materials to protect our youth.
429	3406	2	3	Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either. Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials. Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist. The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let citizens speek their beliefs. Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who might be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life, and learning to navigate it is a crucial part of growing up.
430	3407	2	3	Books are important in the life of human beings wheather they are for studies,entertainment, or any other use. On the other hand, are some books offensive to readers. If certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether. With this being said, Should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed. Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others. This is the case in anything for example movies, books, and daily life. Some people might think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others that is what makes the book. For example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words. Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed, it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beat, you have to describe just how brutal it was to please some readers. Another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive. If a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material. Also if a person rents a movie they know they aren't allowed to get an R-rated movie then they should get another movie. People should know to not get a book read about the offensive stuff without stopping then go complain. If a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not. Even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed. That is only the opinion of sombody. If the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed. If material were removed because someone said it was offensive then ther would never be any more books. For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad. For those reasons materials should not be removed. What if everybody started saying things were offensive ther would not be any more books. People should not have the complete say in the removal of books. Otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material. So do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, or should we instead rely on personal responsibility and choice?
431	3408	2	3	Every parent has their own opinion upon topics like this; but even if you were to censor out books, movies, music, etc., your child would still be allowed to find that book or movie on the internet uncensored. Yes, parents believe that having things censored will be better for their children, but children have much more technology and much more access to uncensored music through their devices and online platforms. As each day goes by the minds of children become more and more curious as to what the world has to offer. The more parents keep their children away from things in life the more chance they have of their child sneaking out or just not being the person you thought they would be. Every person is their own person; I personally would say to just leave the books, music, movies, etc. on the shelves of libraries; children will find out anyways, whether it is from friends, or the media, or their own explorations online. Its not to say that your child will become corrupt if listening to such music, but I believe that at a certain age parents should have talks with their children about stuff that is happening in the world, because children are not going to go be children for long and you will not be able to control them forever. Everybody was a child at one point in time and I am pretty sure that most parents very much disliked when their parents would keep them away from things they wanted to do or maybe that they wanted to see, but life always is not fair and these are just one person's opinions. Either way if you decide to take all the music and censor it out or if you do the same things to all the books and movies, etc. there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents. No matter what happens odds are is that children will find their way around these things, it never fails. There will always be some way your child can get around you, always going to be some way your kids will get past your rules; just think about it, if they disobey you once they will most likely do it again. It is in a child's nature to test boundaries. So like I said before every parent and every person has their own opinion upon topics like such, me personally I say just leave it and let the parents of these children handle it the way they would like to, because you can not please everybody.
432	3409	2	3	Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a certain view set aside for the reader or viewer at hand. If someone has a different view of the text then they should not even be reading or viewing them but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different views to someone else is unreasonable. People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work, and we miss out on valuable perspectives. To have movies banned from the public because they are offensive is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we hear. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone, allowing us to learn from a safe distance. Books are a way that people can express themselves without actually going out and hurting someone or something. Poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced. Books that have political or social views on something should not be discriminated against because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the people. In novels just because someone uses profanity does not mean that their message is any less clear. Their message might be that profanity is used too often or that the way that the next generation below them may turn for the worst but it is not used to harm. Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song it is not specifically said at one person; it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics sung to them might believe that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when its just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express one's inner self. In movies you see someone get shot, brutally murdered or attacked and its already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violence shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severely injure another person although that is how people perceive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something. To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something. Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banned just because they show individuality; just because they have the decency to show us the truth in all the lies told to us by a higher person. These people most likely believe that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one so when people show the way that things are they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth. The censorship of only things that are truly vile should be censored not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the communities are today.
433	3410	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc should be removed from the shelves of libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to know more information about something the library or the museum should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the Libraries and the museums started putting these materials away, many people wouldn't bother to go to either. The museum in my eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been through, and things we have accomplished while we have been there. In the museum could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about your past? No, I couldn't. Eventhough things might seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers. Many people now days rely on the usage of the magazines, books, and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has happened in their past to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that might seem offensive to someone else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in libraries, museums, art shows because everything has its own history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know the full story. I myself, would want to know, than not to ever have known the complete truth of our collective experience.
434	3411	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from public libraries. What if a young child were to stumble across an inappropriate magazine. They would have the images stuck in their heads and could lead to unlawful decisions or confused understandings. There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young aged children. I think that they should either be placed more appropriately or removed completely. Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others, but if read, the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts about others. Personally, I think that most fictional books are entertainment only. They do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part. If someone reads them as offensive, they might just be taking it the wrong way and missing the artistic intent. Most Libraries have areas sectioned off for adults only but they aren't monitored. So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material? They wouldn't have the slightest clue unless they were constantly watched. I think that in today's society, most children already know about sexual graphics and whatnot, so why limit them to what they already know about? There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic than books and magazines. Shouldn't they be banned too if we are to be consistent? The world is exposed to offensive material everyday. We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way. But young children don't know better, so there is no guarantee that they won't take ideas from inappropriate viewings and use them in harmful ways. So maybe things do need to be taken off shelves to provide a safer environment for their developing minds.
435	3412	2	3	Offensive library materials. When entering a library you know your are going to find something interesting to read, listen to, or even watch. Most people use libraries to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropriate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the library and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross books about stuff they shouldn't know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on their shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups with proper guidance. When you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passed by many books about racism. As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading about nascar to reading about racism and different races. I believe that books should be kept in order of age. When a teenager goes into the library to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on their topic. In most libraries there are topics such as sex, killing, and violent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it emotionally and mentally. If I am at the library I will always look for a book to interest me. My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since I was nine or ten. Now that I am older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at the our hometown library and saw a ten year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. When I saw this I was surprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections to help guide young readers. Kids visit the library all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too. Libraries would have trouble containing what kids read, so they should exposed all the different topics but with clear organization. When your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed when your just a little older and can process it better. Next time when you visit the library check and see what kids in your local town are talking and reading about. You will be surprised when a child approaches his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraries should exposed what they want if they want to ensure knowledge to everyone in a responsible and age-appropriate manner.
436	3413	2	3	I don't think nothing should be taking off the shelves at the libraries, if it's educational to your child in a certain way it should stay. Children can learn alot from the books at the libraries, from history to science to social skills. If you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library, they have all the answers. You can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book, which offers a depth of information that a quick online search might miss. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library, completing reports and projects with the resources available. It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for and take the time to search. For some of these adults, if you was having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not mean the same for your child. Sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age, grasping complex ideas more readily. Parents please don't take away the good things out the libraries that could really help your child at times, especially with their schoolwork and personal growth. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start, as libraries carefully consider their acquisitions. There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everthing is on the enternet. So many sciencest found their information in a book, because its easier and often more reliable. You learn so many good things from a libraries, expanding your knowledge and perspective. The books and things in a library help you with so much research, providing a solid foundation for any inquiry. Taking materials out of a library I would have to disagree with, as it limits access for everyone who seeks knowledge and understanding.
437	3414	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. There are multiple reasons to back up this statement, including an accurate quote from author Katherine Paterson. People build their character through their reactions of how people treat them, and similarly, through engaging with challenging ideas. For example, in life sombody might offend another person, but that does not mean the offender is going to dissapear after doing so. How does this relate to libraries you might ask? Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive, and libraries provide a safe space to encounter and understand them. It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch. Just because you might have the option of checking out something you do not think is appropriate or is offensive, does not mean you have to check it out; you can simply walk past it. Some people might enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive to others, as it might align with their interests or perspectives. You might be wanting to argue, 'But I don't want my children being exposed to such offensive materials.' That is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections, with age-appropriate materials in each. If you happen to come across an offensive book in the childrens section, then do not let your child check that out. It is as simple as that. Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time and infringe on others' rights. The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf. She is saying that if one person is allowed to remove a book, then anybody else would be able to have that ablitiy as well. Therefore, a book that does not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it. Eventually, there would be no books left, defeating the very purpose of a library. In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out. You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else might want to check them out and find value in them.
438	3415	2	3	No i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive. Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read, and what one person finds offensive, another may find enlightening. I think that if you dont like the book and think its offensive that you shouldnt get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it. Not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason, to serve the diverse interests of the community. The library screans all of the books that they get in and wouldnt buy something if no one asked for it or if it wasnt a good book to have, ensuring a baseline of quality and relevance. I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it. Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoing the books that they have an intrest in? If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldnt be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read, leaving the shelves barren. I also think that if you dont like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldnt be lookin in that section, go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read. Theres something for everyone in a library, from fiction to biographies to reference works. This is why i think its not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves, no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive', ultimately silencing diverse voices and ideas.
439	3416	2	3	I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage, but these are likely very few. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them, as these often contain important, if difficult, truths. School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups, with content suitable for their developmental stage. If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out, using their professional judgment. The music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song, and libraries typically have rating systems to guide patrons. Movies should be age appropiate too. Thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section. Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section, which is a more reasonable solution than removal. Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people who may wish to access it. Besides no ones making you check out that book; the power of choice remains with the individual.
440	3417	2	3	hey what book is that lets me see it because I don't think I want you to read it because it is to graphic for a young year old boy. This is what some parents might say to their child if they don't want them to read a certian kind of book or even a certin book. I feel that censorship is not needed in libraries, because either way the kids will be exposed to something the parents don't want them to see sooner or later, whether at school or with friends. I do not belive that any one has thr rite to remove anything from the shelves except the library itself. The can go ahead and complain that they dont't want it there. But if the library has it the library should be able to keep it there wheathere or not people don't want it there, as it serves the broader community. I think the only real people that can remove a book for the shelves is the managers or manager if they agree with the patron after a formal review process. Ohter than those certin people I don't think a reagular person can remove anything from the shelves, as that would lead to chaos. At the library i go to they have any kind of book, music, movie, and magazine you want. Wether it is a adult content book to a rated r movie they have anything and they get new things every week to keep the collection fresh. So if a person does not want a certin thing on the shelves they should not be able to by themselves take it from the shelves because what if another person wants to see the movie but they can't because a parent took it from the shelf because they did not want their kid being exposed to it. One time at my library i saw a verbal fight between a patron and the library manager the patron did not want the book in the section it was in because they felt it was to provacative for a childrens book. The manager refused to take it off the shelf becasue the library can have whatever books they want on their shelves, upholding the principle of access. Another time i saw a person break a dvd because they thaught children at the age their children were should not be allowed to see those kinds of movies. But breaking the movie is just putting other people that want to see it put because noe htey can't because it is broken, which is a destructive and selfish act. To summerize everything I do not think citizens should not be allowed to removeantything from the shelves only the managers of the library should be able to remove anyhting if they want, following established policies and procedures.
441	3418	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say, repeating words they do not understand. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine, removing the most objectionable content. The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product. Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did @CAPS7. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school. @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien. Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren. Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win. I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child. As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7. Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7. That would be on the parents plate to deal with. Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain. Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty. I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up. Thank You, @PERSON2.
442	3419	2	3	I myself think that all books should be of the shelves because I do find some books to be offensive in their contents. I also find it very annoying when people have books and you are trying to talk to them @CAPS2 all they do is ignore you @CAPS2 keep reading i find that disrespectful and rude. Myself though i do not like reading I find it to be boring @CAPS2 somtimes tireing unless it is actually a good book that captures my attention. I also could say that some movies should be taken off shelves because they are so stupid @CAPS2 have no point such as harry potter, twilight and most other books that have mythical creatures in them, which I find unbelievable. Music on the other hand should @CAPS5 be taken off because it is alot easier to relate to and understand I @MONTH1 be wrong but thats my personal opinoin of the whole ordeal some music in the lyrics can show who you are and what you stand for in life music shows character @CAPS2 is easire to follow then movies or a boreing old book.I listen to music all the time you hardly ever see me with a book in my hands I sometimes do watch movies but they are more action , comady though I really don'@CAPS10 like scary movies though I do watch some @CAPS2 I don'@CAPS10 like ones with weird looking creatures in it thats just not what I look for in a movie. I can list some books, movies @CAPS2 music I like, for instant twoo books I like are  blood is thicker @CAPS2 untill we @CAPS4 again by @PERSON3. Movies I like are all five of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movies, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4 The @PERSON4 and my all time favorite @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 And the new karoti kid. Music I listen to consist of @CAPS8-@CAPS9, @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON2, @PERSON5, @LOCATION3, @CAPS10-@CAPS11, @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @ORGANIZATION5, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 they are all great singer song writers and do a great job at what they do @CAPS2 make millions off of it I mean come on people love music more then anything. there are movie music albums sold in the world the there are book and movies combind which I really think proves a big point when I say music is better. Serveys have been taken music wins everytime. So therefore this concludes my opinion on this subject and I hope I voiced it good enough to prove my point to people in the world that say books @CAPS2 movies are better because their not, and I stand by what I believe.
443	3420	2	3	Sometimes i think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library. i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy. Or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up. My views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best. Music, magazines, books, and movies. All of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings. It seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material. Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe. Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. Movies and television. when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie. Most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. Thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. Television is basically the same for movies. You can learn a lot from a offensive @CAPS1 show, you can learn what and what not to do. Also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books; books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. People seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama. We attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @MONTH1 have had. Also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @MONTH1 be intersted in. last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines. Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. I go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip. I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. Also because of the false information. The false information that that give, is what we wanna buy. But for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up. I believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. They all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds, and that is why they remain popular.
444	3421	2	3	@PERSON1, an author, once said; 'All of use can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, she @CAPS2 prooving the fact that books should not be censored in any form of way, in which I take the affirmative side on. To begin with, censorship @CAPS2 simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive. An example of this would be the society in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2. In this book, @PERSON3, the main character and eventually the protagonist, @CAPS2 a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out. The government believes that books are dangerous because they cause people to become knowledgable so as a result, they order people to burn them, making society ignorant and a potential 'slave' to their government. Despite loosing his job and almost being killed by the goverment, @PERSON3 rises to understand that books have true meaning and that what the government @CAPS2 doing @CAPS2 wrong. This topic now poses a question: '@CAPS2 all censorship bad?' Of course not. Some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact. For example, any form of media whether it @CAPS2 books or magazines that portreys hatred toward a certain religion or group should be censored by the government because according to our constitution, people have the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also know as 'freedom of speech'). However, the majority of censorship does not take a good side. In the political world today, censorship @CAPS2 applied to people who speak out against their government or leader due to the fact that they had been dishonest or ruthless to the people. Even in our country today, the government applies this which in some cases violates the constitution because people have the freedom of speech, but to a certain extent only. Overall, the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes. Censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it @CAPS2 wrong. On the other had, censorship towards things that portey hatred @CAPS2 not bad either. In conclusion however, bad censorship causes people to become uneducated, at the end resulting in pure ignorance and a loss of valuable knowledge.
445	3422	2	3	I find it intresting that people think that its there problem to go to the book self and
446	3423	2	3	Should libraries censor reading materials for students at school? That is a yes and no question because reading is good for people of all ages; it's just a matter of whether the topic is suitable for certain age groups. Yes, I do think they should censor reading material, but to an extent. They need to have books for kids at certain age groups, like having sections for young kids, then teens, and then adults. If a child wants to read more graphic material, then they must have permission from their parent. The reason I say that is there are things that get published by authors that are meant to be read by certain people, and having a structured system helps guide young readers toward content that is appropriate for their level of maturity and understanding. This approach supports literacy while also providing necessary safeguards for developing minds.
447	3424	2	3	Regardless of if we are speaking of the religious demanding books such as the Harry Potter series to be ripped from our shelves or politicians wanting to burn the library, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so. Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future. Imagine the impact if the government had locked away every copy of the Bible because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of Shakespeare or Hemingway. It would be a world far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place. While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading 'Playboy', they definitely should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music may have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they might speak a message. To a creationist Darwin's views may seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they might be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own. We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another, for such restrictions ultimately impoverish our collective intellectual and cultural life.
448	3425	2	3	I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what your picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shelves of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyone's opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for. Censorship in libraries is just unneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they don't pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child, providing a simple and reasonable safeguard. Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some it might be pictures. For others it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just can not be avoided. So why take it out of libraries. If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book may contain material that could offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectedly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that might enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them. Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what your picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that might enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries. It's not accomplishing anything other than limiting access and choice for the community.
449	3426	2	3	I think that we should censor things our children read and look at in the libraries. They are young eyes and they are too young to be looking at that stuff. They would be taught the wrong thing at a very young age. They would grow up the wrong way, influenced by concepts they are not yet mature enough to process or understand fully. We need to take a stand on what our kids look at. For the future we need censorship to help guide and protect our children from material that could be harmful or confusing during their formative years. Please everyone take a stand for the well-being and proper development of the next generation, ensuring they are introduced to complex ideas only when they are ready.
450	3427	2	3	Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves? No we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it in your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be. I like car magazines. Magazines like Car and Driver, or Hot Rod. If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off. My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book, magazine or whatever it might be up. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you? I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like Hot Rod. Just non-hurtful things. All it took though was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. Car fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem? The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if your a very religious person, then yes I understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful. Finally, I just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean someone else won't. You wouldn't want it to happen to you, so it is only fair to extend that same courtesy to others in the community.
451	3428	2	3	First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. From the Nazi regime of Germany to the banning of dissent in the Soviet empire. It always is a terror that falls violently. Farenheit 451 was written by Ray Bradbury in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness, a distorted narrative designed for control. As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end. Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. When the malignant being is the government itself. This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it. I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the Iron Curtain. History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies. A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want. It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest. What will become of the uncertain future? We must choose freedom.
452	3429	2	3	Dear Library Board Members, I think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive. People at libraries fight over a book. They need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book. If the library dosen't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums for everyone. People in library fight over a sigle book. I think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. And that is why we have fights over a book. The next time you are in a library think frist before you act. Ask yourself 'Did they get ther before me?'. The library should have more that one copy of a book. Lets say 'Harry Potter' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. Now the lat move of 'Harry Potter' is coming out this December (2005) and people what the last book to read. The kids what it, but there is one book. So what do you do? Get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy. If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. You don't what to fight in a library (look at rule number 5). Now if it was me, I will let someone have it that whan it. So, libraries need more than one copy. In conclusion I think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if found offensive. There fighting for a book and you don't whant that. The libraries needs more than one copy of a book, so they will not fight over it. If the libraries don't have copies of a book it will create prolums. So, think before yo act. It can be found offensive at time. Sincesly, A Concerned Patron.
453	3430	2	3	What do you consider an offensive book? Everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive. So how can you justify that a book, magizine, movie, music, etc. should be removed from a shelf due to content. Of course there are the ones that most people would aggree that are offensive to young kids and even some adults but then again other people don't find the same things offensive. The items that do contain graphic content, cursing, etc. and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others, perhaps in a designated section for mature audiences. So honestly no one can say that a certain book(s), music, movie(s), magazine(s), etc. do not have a right to have a place on a shelf and should or shouldn't be removed. If parents dont want there children or teenagers looking or seeing certain material that is something that the parents need to take into their own hands not a library or anywhere else. Now if this is an item at the home of a parent and they dont want their kids to see it they have every write to remove it from the shelf. Then again if their child or teen finds this item and looks at it and the parents didn't want them to they shouldn't have bought it in the first place of they should have removed the item. So can you as a stranger justify wheather or not somthing is offensive and a parent shouldn't let their kid look at it, or that a library or store shouldn't have that item on the shelf? No you can't. If you don't want you children to see it or if you don't set standards and rules, that is a parental duty, not a public one.
454	3431	2	3	Every book has a meaning or message that all should know about. Taking a book away from a library shelf can decrease of knowledge from someone that might need that information. Just because a book may have certain views that can be offensive does not mean it should not be allowed on a shelf. A book should not be discriminated by what the contets may have source of a reader. Positive and negative books should all be allowed on shelve for any whom that have an intrested. As for music and movies that could be place in the same catogoery can be reasonable. Its really not that neccasary to be place in a library because its a place known for peace and quite and relaxation. If music or movies become a hazard then it should not be welcome in the library. Positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand. It is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book. Magazine is another non neccasary object that is place in the library. A magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it. Not all magazine have something that can be use to educate. Most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe. Magazines should be removed from the library. The library should be an experience of a learning envirnment and only materials that will be a good help instead entertainment for pleasure. Remove a book from a shelf is like decrease from knowledge that could have been known. As to remove books should not be allowed no matter how or what the content of the book may be. As for music, movies, and magazines should be a limited for usuage in the library, ensuring the primary focus remains on educational and literary materials.
455	3432	2	3	'Books Should be Taken off the Shelves' Books should be taken off the shelves? Nothing. At least thats what I think. For ant book you can find some bad thing about it. People can not keep bad things away from kids it doesnt work like that. Wether it is cusing, sex, gore, racsisem teens will find them and I think it would be better if they were foung in a book instead of real life. Most young adult books have cusing. There is no way around it. Teens hear cusing every day. At home, school, or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is there and part of our life. Most adults think thats if they don't shelter teens then they will find all this bad stuff in music. What adults don't understand is that teens doo what ever they want to be happy. The music of today's is very offensive, but the like it!!!!! THat is what is 'hot' in the music world right now. Ok say a kid was from a run down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't like. That pop music would make the kid happy. Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive??? Sex a lot of really good books have sex in there, but if a kid is at home reading about sex the he or she is not out doing it. Plus sex makes books better. I read books that contain rape, and other sexual acts but I've never done it only read about it. Race is anouther big deal. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is an amazing book and every kid should read it so they can learn. That is the whole point in reading is so you can learn. We need to learn about those kind of thing. Keep us sheltered is not going to protect us it only makes us want what ever we can't have even more. Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn dont take that away from us. If we don't like it we will not read it or leason to it. Don't chose for us let us learn on our own. It is our life. Let us make our own mistakes and discoveries.
456	3433	2	3	Libraries are not liked by many people, but most people do appreciate them. Libraries are almost in every town, serving as community hubs. People like to go there to read books, get on the computers, and do activities with their families. But there are some things that people would really want to do there but they cannot because of their age or so, or it just might be prohibited at all times. Do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone? Most people really do not think that you must always go to the library for things because if you are an irresponsible person with all the damage that you have done to the item that you have checked out or how late you turn it in, it could cost the same amount of money as buying that item. If you are a responsible person then you are fine. But some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let any one touch it or check it out. So if they are not going to let one person get an item from the library then it should be removed from there, because there will be at least one person who will want to get that item and it would be rude if the librarian tells you no you cannot have that. Libraries should just stick to the same old same old: a section for kids with kid books, a section for the middle schoolers and the teenagers, and a section for the high schoolers and the adults, and mostly everything will work out fine. The goal is to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town. Now that some facts and opinions have been stated, hopefully the libraries and librarians do think about what they are going to put and what they are not going to put on the shelves of a public library to make it fair for everyone. So do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone.
457	3434	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1'm writing your newspaper company this letter because I feel the same way Katherine Paterson feels, and we should not be able to have any of the following books @NUM2, and any sexual books. Because they can scar a kid's mind forever, so in my opinion any books with that stuff in the book should not be on the shelf for any public library. Also we should have more sensitivity in books with inappropriate speaking because it can give a person a change in thought, leading them in the wrong direction. Also let me give you an example, lets say a little boy asks where the action books are, the librarian would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading these books and the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book and my big brother said it a good book too. The librarian should not be able to deny the child based on age if the content is suitable. And in my opinion that is all I need to say. Sincerely your customer @PERSON2.
458	3435	2	3	This statement is not right. People should be allowed to read whatever they want or listen to or watch whatever movie they want. When someone reads something that's bad they might dislike it or not. So people should not take away books, movies, and music that are considered bad. One thing is certain: people should have a choice of what they read and other stuff. Books, for instance; some people like reading bad stuff because they enjoy it. If the person does not like it they should put it back and find something else to read. Now movies are a lot of fun to watch. But when you watch a new movie you should rent it first to see if you like the offensive scenes or not. And the age thing, yes you should watch a movie with an adult if you are too young. Now music is one thing that is offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Because if you don't like it do not pick it up from the shelves and tell people that's bad music when it could be some great music to others. Ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shelves is the magazines. Its bad for people to be reading those types of magazines. If they want them they should order them offline through the mail at their house. So people should not take off the shelves books, movies, and music but they can take away magazines. People like the books and stuff that have bad stuff in them. And there should be no taking items off the shelves. That's what I think of if someone took something off the shelves.
459	3436	2	3	I think that books, music, movies, and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries. People find entertainment in movies with sexual or violent activity in them. I believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involves offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset, as they enjoy that content. In our generation today, people look forward to see things that they can't see at home with their parents. Music these days have a lot of bad language in them, but that's what makes people interested in them. The same applies to movies. Books, music, and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement. This kind of stuff gets our attention, and makes us interested and engaged. If you have a child or someone in the family that you don't want them to watch, listen, or read about offensive stuff then don't let them see it. Most stores with offensive stuff have a back room where they keep all of it, so they don't have to worry about others seeing it, and libraries could consider similar options. People do take it offensive sometimes but that doesn't mean that libraries should have to take them off their shelves entirely. People can make their own decision of what they want to listen, watch, or read. Everybody can choose what they prefer. Everybody has their own opinion on things. I think that libraries will have more business with the offensive things then without. Younger people find more interest in the things that seem like a dream, or things that seem so unreal and exciting. I think that they should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines out on shelves, because we have our own freedom to do what we want. Lots of people find many pleasures in watching offensive things. If you don't want to see or listen to stuff you don't prefer then don't look for them at the libraries, it is a simple matter of personal choice.
460	3437	2	3	If you get offended because of a book, magazine, music, or movies than don't read, watch, or listen to it. America shouldn't be censored; freedom of choice is important. Censorship should be for young children. If you're grown and get offended by something having the '@CAPS1-word' on it then don't read it. If a movie drops the '@CAPS1-bomb' then don't watch it. I completely disagree with someone wanting to remove vulgar words from public access. I don't get offended by swearing because its usually used in a funny way, like telling jokes, or it makes a crappy song good and more entertaining. Censorship is helpful in some contexts, but vulgar things shouldn't be removed from society, and it never will be entirely gone. More often than not, kids learn cuss words from parents or friends, not primarily from media. If you don't want your kid to cuss or be surrounded by cussing then remove them from that situation or monitor their access. It's the parents responsibility to protect or 'censor' a childs environment, not the library's duty to remove material for everyone.
461	3438	2	3	The books in the libraries that I have read so far don't seem like they would be offensive to anyone, and I haven't really listened to the music in the libraries or watched the movies, and the magazines seem fine too. That doesn't mean that there isn't any of those that can be offensive to other people, but if there is then I think that they should take them out of the libraries. I think if someone found something like that they would probably just put it back and not go there again, rather than making a formal complaint. If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive, then I bet a lot of them would be out and that wouldn't be fair to other people because maybe they want to listen or read or watch them. They would be really mad if they found out they were taken out because other people thought they were offensive. Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someone's feelings or be offensive to other people, but then there's other ones that don't care at all. I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad, and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and getting their feelings hurt or anything. But if they're not that bad then I don't think they should be gone, and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them. If there's ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries, then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going. So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people that keep going in the libraries because a lot of people enjoy reading and that's what they do for fun, and they would be really upset if they couldn't go no more over something that stupid.
462	3439	2	3	I think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are okay to have available. Many people need to read them and see what they are about for themselves. I think people take little things, such as curse words, or if the book or magazine is talking about drugs, and take offense too easily. I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it somewhere. Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it actually is. I have read many books myself that have inappropriate words in them, and it didn't ruin the story. I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when I started reading it, it had a lot of curse words in it. I guess that's just how it is now a days; you honestly cannot find a book without at least one bad word in it. People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials, as it's a part of modern writing. I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines etc. should be removed from the shelves just because one person is offended. It could be interesting to someone else but not you, and that's the point of having a variety. Many people have different opinions about different kinds of things and I think it should just be left up to that person whether or not they read, listen or even look at certain kind of reading material.
463	3440	2	3	Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? As stated in our constitution, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury ever since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also, we have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not to. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question. In the Constitution, it states that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason, places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on their shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inappropriate, it still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for; parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken off the shelves, we would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines may be beneficial to some and offensive to others. However, for those who would find this beneficial, do we want to simply go against our Constitution and deprive them of that information? Another topic in the Constitution is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelf, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell their kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that may seem inappropriate to some aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelf. However, some may come across a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on a child who is not supposed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information; all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it. As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example, I was restricted from watching rated R movies or things with inappropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children, for the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privilege to view them. In conclusion, removing materials, such as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before, doing something like this would be going against our constitution. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white; children should just not pick up those types of materials, end of case.
464	3441	2	3	The library has many books; they would have anything that you could possibly imagine. The library is a great resource for any information you might need. They have so much information that if you were to go to the library, you would be there all day just looking through everything. Libraries carry many different kinds of books, from fiction to science to history. They would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats or any other specific topic. There are libraries all around us and are very convenient for everyone to use. If a library carried misleading books, music, movies, or even magazines, I would have to say that they could get in a lot of trouble, especially if a magazine or a movie or any other source of information would show anything that would offend someone in any way. Then someone should tell the librarian or the manager and say this should not be on the shelf. When people go to the library they are expecting clean reviews about the library and its contents. If a library were meant to carry offensive products it would not be called the library. The library is meant to be a quiet place where someone could go there and browse around maybe, or just go in and get what they need and come right on out. Most libraries are pretty particular about what they should or should not put out on their shelves. If someone put something way out of the ordinary, and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf, they should automatically be fired for not following the rules. In conclusion, libraries are very nifty and important to the town or city. The only thing would be is to keep an eye out for any offensive books, music, and etc. You never know when they will be randomly out on the shelf, and if you happen to find one you should immediately tell the librarian or the libraries manager. The library may get in trouble and then again they may not, but it is better to be safe and report it.
465	3442	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I would have to say no. The reason why I state this is because those are the books that help you through out your life. There are rude and horrible things out in the world, and life is not always easy, and some of those books would help you with your decision making. Now these are the reasons why I think so. First, how would the book help others in the long run? I think it would because some books talk about the real deal, like how a teenage girl becomes a mother at a young age, or how kids don't finish school and now they are on the street, in jail, or worse. Books and materials like these make a difference in someone's life other than your own, so that's one reason. Secondly, these books are like a guide to others. The reason why I say that is because if people read about violence and stuff, they would see what they don't want to go through. Like myself for example, I was reading this book called My Hood, and this book talked about a lot of stuff that I have seen with my own eyes like gang banging, sex, drugs, hood fights etc., that happens in the real world. Thirdly, many people that I know of don't really like to get advice or talk to other people about their problems, and they can get a book or something that has the same features as what they might be going through. Those books and things are not very bad; they actually help a great deal. And like I said before, they really are not bad; they are like a little guide to many people who need it. So in conclusion, do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazine, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Absolutely not, because those books talk about real life, and life is not always fair or easy to deal with.
466	3443	2	3	Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people may not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if the article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. If you saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like that? Yes, books and movies should be censored. Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie 'Superbad.' That movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on that movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little boy quoting lines from the 'The Hangover.' That movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little boy talking about things that are way over his head. Teenagers that listen to music from Lil Wayne or Drake are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. Their songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, 'Well if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers weren't exposed to that kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things. As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One might think that once they're older they can do what they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate, shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinent until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases. If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we continue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot, things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds.
467	3444	2	3	I do not believe that movies, books, music, etc. should be removed from shelves. I believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to, read or watch, everybody has their own level of maturity. Parents who are concerned about their child watching or reading something, always have the right to tell them no, and to keep whatever it is out of their grasp. People are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate level material for themselves. Whether it is books, movies or music, a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item. It is a good idea to keep more explicit things only for adults, but if it is supposed to be for a certain age level, it should be out for the choice to be up to that certain person. Different people have different levels of maturity, so it is hard for one person or company to say what age level should or should not be using that material. A lot of parents will disagree with this issue, because they think that children should be kept away from the violence and vulgar images or language that are in the media these days. But at the same time, they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to. People have the right to take away material that is too mature for their child, but no one should be able to say that someone else's child should not be able to view that material, because just because one person may find it offensive, does not mean that other people will. If someone should find something offensive they should have the common sense to not view that material any more, it's that simple. Everyone has that right so I do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them. Parents can censor what their children watch, and adults have the ability to make their own decisions about this topic. This proves that certain items, like books, movies, and music, should not be taken off the shelf.
468	3445	2	3	I personally don't believe they should use censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone might think that it is offensive because, that's just one persons opinion. What's one man's trash is another man's gold, what one person finds offensive could be sought out by millions. Plus in today's world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has their own opinion and their own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at least one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to express themselves. If censorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kids would have nothing to be involved in. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was censored there would be nothing left to be enjoyed. Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that you're not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset especially if they're an adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives.
469	3446	2	3	The quote that Katherine Paterson declares makes a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in another's point of view. Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyone's personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disgusting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation where this has been a conflict. During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that I loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire PTA found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things I loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody's possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rot and vanish forever. I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taken off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you don't like the novel, then I suggest you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?
470	3447	2	3	Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another may not see any true beauty. But when people hardly understand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know what it is like to be truly offended. When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyone's group. Everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I had a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I knew it, school was half way over. I was still a nobody. Then Alex came along and made me a somebody. Alex, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, Alex approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with Alex. Months went by before I realized Alex and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though Alex and I were close, I felt as though he was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything he needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no. Alex and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to linger for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly Alex spoke and said, 'Why are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. Alex sensed that I had no clue what he was talking about so he continued. 'I'm gay.' I was appalled. Not because he was gay, but because he had never told me. I asked, 'What happened?' He sat on the couch then and told me about how he was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. I felt awful for Alex. It wasn't his fault he was gay. I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be allowed on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some, always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them, not read or listen to things that can hurt someone's inner feelings.
471	3448	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I do indeed believe that certain books, magazines or any other form of reading material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive. I say this because, in every situation, either one side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits. If you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences, then do not put it on a public display. It is best that they are in a solitary area for audiences mature enough to handle the influence and/ or consequences that go along with that type of material. I say influence, because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media. These children act in ways that reflect what they have seen. If they watch a movie full of violence, they may feel it is their job to act in violent manners. Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility to make their own decisions, they let the outside world decide what is best.  As a child grows up, they are obligated to follow certain rules or take authoritative matters seriously. Authority teaches us, as children. We develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings. You may ask what it is I am speaking about. Well, I believe that this situation relates to the phrase 'think before you speak' because it seems that the people displaying this media don't think about the after effects of their actions. I suggest that certain material may not only be impacting children and teens, but adults are highly affected as well. I am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people. I am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised. The media gives us insight and ideas, which sometimes revolve around our every thought.  I do believe that certain media should be displayed in confidential locations. If not, then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit. My concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, @LOCATION1.
472	3449	2	3	Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young readers. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. People think that having young people exposed to this offensive material will affect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations. At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. It is that person's right to choose whether or not it is age appropriate for them or not. It is not someone else's right to take away choices that aren't theirs.  People who believe that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds. They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying. This in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader, which may cause the young reader to be more aggressive or more likely to make bad decisions about their well being or the well being of those around them. These people want their libraries to be about learning and be a healthy environment where young minds can grow naturally and unharmed by offensive material.  People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say it is no one else's right to make this decision for you by removing them. It is the reader's right to choose whether or not to read the material. The reader will most likely learn what the material is saying regardless of whether it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe environment than to have someone else later in their life show them or tell them. The environment may be a lot more dangerous than a library if learned through someone else.  I believe in both in a way. I believe it is not someone else's right to remove these books from libraries. But I also believe that it should not be available for young readers to get. These books may be offensive to some people but it is their choice to read it. They do not have to read these books; it does not affect them. I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have access to them. If a reader's parents want them to learn about it in a safe environment then they should sit their children down and explain it to them themselves. In the end we all have our rights and we use those to choose whether to read or listen to certain material. It is no one else's choice besides your own.
473	3450	2	3	While there are many books written out there that offend many types of people, there are some that just need to be wiped off the face of the earth. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That is one of my favorite quotes and I don't use it lightly. Take for example 'The @ORGANIZATION1', the very book that gives instructions to build bombs, teaches you how to use firearms, etc. This book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand like their religion and how they look. This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach. That is why I think this book needs to be taken off the shelves for good. There was also hate propaganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive and that's disgusting; I would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone.  One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than @PERSON1, the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to their undeserved graves. He sent men, women, and children to his many death camps and work camps. One of those many children was @PERSON2 who was in hiding from the Gestapo or '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. Because of this monster the world lost one of the greatest and most deep writers for the @DATE1's. This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. But if we did not have this book we would be sure to expect another @CAPS8 on our hands.  All in all, censorship in the libraries should be a rule but only for the books worth keeping, not these horrific books. We must be vigilant in protecting society from such dangerous and hateful ideologies.
474	3451	2	3	The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire. Not everyone is interested in the same book genre. The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of. If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it. They should not be removed from the shelves of the library.  I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library. What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing? If the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. If a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropriate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie. It just is not fair to everyone else.  The library is public property. With that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment. They are obligated to supply books, movies, etc. for whomever. If one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want. The library cannot possibly cater to every individual's personal sensibilities without failing its broader mission.  A few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library. There were too many complaints about inappropriate books being supplied or taken off of the shelves. That year, the library lost @PERCENT1 of their customers because every time the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased. This constant conflict ultimately served no one and diminished a valuable community resource.  If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy. If someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can search another shelf. Those who complain are only making more work for themselves and detracting from a shared public good.
475	3452	2	3	Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain people? In all honesty yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting. No matter what the content that the book or song contains it's their choice; there is a power called freedom in this world. One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are written in that book or sung in a song, then yes, read and listen to anything you want.  If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex, you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it. So yes, any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them. It is not that you have to be mature enough to read a book; it is that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say. Yes, some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later. Reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before. Both books and songs are a way to express yourself and everyone should express themselves in some way.  When it comes to movies, that's a different story. Those movies are rated for a reason. On a rated @CAPS2 film I could see @NUM1 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads. Also most have been in sex education class. Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too. So yes, let @NUM1 year olds on up watch rated @CAPS2 films. The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them. Say a parent took a @NUM3 year old to see a scary movie; more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from seeing blood, stabbing, and sexual content.  Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for. When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools and also good for expression of one's self. So learn, experience, and express. No matter what you're interested in, freedom was given to you so use it wisely and to its fullest potential.
476	3453	2	3	I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in highschool. Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about difficult subjects like drugs, rape, and partying, and they contained inappropriate language. Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want. People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong; if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think they're offensive, as that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think they're offensive. When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive.
477	3454	2	3	I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. They are certain books, music, movies, and magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some awful material in it, with content that is truly disturbing. The pictures in magazines, on cd cases or on movie/dvd cases would have stuff that people find really offensive. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all around the world. People might not get what certain materials want you to do, but they get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. The school would then have to consider the complaint and potentially take action. Certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are deemed too harmful or inappropriate for the school environment. This is a necessary step to maintain a safe and respectful space for all students.
478	3455	2	3	Libraries have the right to decide how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material may be considered offensive to certain people. However some materials may be as offensive to one person, it may not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many other rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves. There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. However, some materials may be found offensive to someone, it may not be found offensive to others. A library may not be able to please everyone. 'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if someone finds something offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves. A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disturbances. A person probably isn't looking for something offensive. Therefore coming across something that is offensive may be disturbing; however they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that person's choice to choose that library to attend. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If someone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library. Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across an offensive piece of material it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of its merchandise that may be considered offensive. There simply would be nothing left. People should be aware that they may come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will always be the people's choice of attending that library.
479	3456	2	3	I believe that some material should be removed if very offensive. I also believe that if it's helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone has different thoughts about what is offensive or appropriate and what's not. Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books, music, movies, magazines, and so on are appropriate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be appropriate for them. And the library should put warning stickers on the book, so that person knows about the graphic or vulgar language. Therefore, I believe that the libraries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelves. And so forth my decision is to not remove certain material, only if extremely offensive. The libraries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or vulgar language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our libraries. Even though a lot of people will disagree, this is what I believe should happen. Here's why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the librarian and told what happen. I guess I said a very inappropriate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now every time my mother takes my younger brothers to the library she makes sure the book they want are appropriate for their age group so the same incident won't happen again. Wouldn't you be the same way with your children? I know I would not just for my kids but for other children also. A warning system is a fair compromise for everyone.
480	3457	2	3	In today's world being a child isn't the easy thing, they have ideas and thoughts racing through our mind constantly, whether it is the stress of school or what they're doing this weekend. But the last thought a child would have is if the literature they're reading is offensive or not. I do not think that censorship should be enforced more than it already is. Although that parents, and the government would disagree, censorship is going to do nothing but make our future children more close minded and sheltered than they already are. Children shouldn't lose their innocence so soon but they shouldn't be so naive about the world either. So I'm against censorship, because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered. Censorship is already posted on music and movies, and it's not doing anything; children are still going to listen to music that isn't appropriate for their age, but they don't know the meaning behind the lyrics. And censoring movies and TV shows aren't going to help much either, because of the internet it has made it easier for teens and children to access things more easily. So unless we censor the internet to a certain degree, which nobody wants that to happen, then we have to let our children be more open to the public world, because they will find out about certain things sooner or later. Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually, but it doesn't have to. If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certain topics then censorship wouldn't be needed. Open communication is the true solution to this problem.
481	3458	2	3	Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I am writing to you @DATE1 because there is so much conflict on the issue of 'if materials in the library are offensive should they be removed from their shelves'. I know there are people that will agree or disagree but what I think they should do is leave them. Yes I said it they should stay right where they are. People all over this world get themselves worked up over all the little things in life but what we don't understand is there is always gonna be something in life we don't like and that's never going to change. Like this for example, people taking offense to materials in the library and wanting them to be removed. I mean come on people wake up and realize you are not always going to have things as you want them there's always going to be things you just have to deal with it. I believe that these types of materials should stay right where they're at because people can overlook them we just decided not to. We all make a big deal over something so small. People should just not look at it and move on don't sit there and fuss about it just turn around and walk away just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others don't. Everybody in this world needs to see that there are things we're not going to like but we have to get over them and move on. This will always happen and there's nothing we can do about it. All over the universe people @MONTH1 agree or disagree with what I have to say but it's your perspective and what you think about it is your choice. I will say though that they should stay but people need to get over themselves and see the truth in life and know that even though there are things we don't like don't sit there and argue about it just leave it and go your own way. So this is my essay to you. People need to see they're always not going to get what they want in life but they need to move on. Like this if you have a problem with the things around you such as taking offense to materials in the library and wanting them removed well sorry but no. Learn to walk away from it because what you like @MONTH1 not be what others like and what they like @MONTH1 not be what you like we just have to go on with life leave it be because others opinions @MONTH1 not match yours. Leave the materials alone because we as people need to see we're not always going to get our way in life and to take hold of learning how to blow it off instead of making a big deal about something so little we could have walked away from.
482	3459	2	3	I do not believe that books should be censored. I believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up. The books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why can't they read them if they're in their sight. I've gone in libraries plenty of times and in all my experiences I have never come across an offensive book. If the books are offensive I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see. All the times I go to the Libraries I have never come across a book that was offensive. I think that if they allow some commercials to be put on television then why can't some books be put on display. I believe that reading sharpens the mind and if a kid picks up an adult book, who are we to say no you can not read that. The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place. If your child picks up a book that you don't want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place. If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store. The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music. If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online. There is no reason why you should have any complaints to a library; the library is a place to help you. It is not mandatory to go to one; if you do not like what they have then do not go to the library. Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc. should not be censored. If you don't like the movies they have don't go to the library. If you think their magazines are inappropriate then order magazines online. If you don't like their books then order online or go to a book store. That is why I believe books should not be censored.
483	3460	2	3	As many would agree, censorship is a growing topic of concern throughout the world. I personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent. If one feels the content of music, a movie, or a book is questionable, he or she has the option of reading, listening, or watching. Among many debated materials, movies have ratings, just as music has 'bleeps'. Movies are rated '@CAPS1' for all audiences, '@CAPS2' standing for parental guidance, '@NUM1' for parental guidance for ages @NUM2 and older, and lastly '@CAPS3' meaning that anyone under the age of @NUM3 is either suggested or required to have an adult present during the viewing of the film. At home, the ratings are all based on the parent's preference. At the movie theatre, the restrictions become a sort of law. Anyone below the age of thirteen is not permitted to see a movie that is '@NUM1' or '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by an adult (anyone @NUM5 or older). Anyone who isn't @NUM3 or older @MONTH1 not enter a movie rated '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by someone @NUM7 or older. Depending on where you are, the restrictions @MONTH1 be more or less harsh. Ultimately, the rating system is intended to force parents to choose what is and isn't appropriate for their child. As for music on the radio, all 'curse words' are 'bleeped' out. If a person wants to buy their own music, artists are required to make two of the same album, one with censors and one without. Thus creating a decision usually for the parents, usually assuming they are the ones to buy the album or the music for their child. When it comes to books, there are no ratings, just genres letting the reader know who the author's intended audience is. Types of genres include 'adult', 'young adult' and 'children' sections in libraries and book stores. Just like music and television, the final choice in the purchase is all dependent on the parents. Even though many restrictions are put in place, there are still some faults to the system. Obviously if you are @NUM2 or younger, you most likely won't have identification. This leaves the person working at the movie theatre the option to let in who they believe to be of age. Looks @MONTH1 be deceiving. Buying music from the internet doesn't require any type of identification either. How can they prove your age? When purchasing a book, not many cashiers would stop a child and say, 'that's inappropriate for you'. Maybe kids of all ages should have identification. Although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system, it seems to all lead back to the parents. Censorship is a huge topic of discussion for the parents of today's young and growing society, but in reality, if they have an issue with the content, they themselves will either rid of the material or prohibit the use and or purchase of it. All in all, it's about the parents and their personal preference.
484	3461	2	3	No books should be taken off the shelf. Most people have different taste in books, magazines or movies. If people find one of those offensive, then why can't they ignore it? They can go find a different one. Not everyone should have the same taste as one person, that's what makes the person we are today. If everyone had the same taste in everything this would be a pretty boring world. I'm more into horror novels more than anything. My own opinion, I think they have a lot of excitement; with the killing and what not. I'm also not a big fan of reading, I read when I absolutely have nothing to do. It's very hard to move onto a different series of novels. Such as: romance, horror, adventures, even poetry! It takes a lot to understand poetry. Poetry has a lot of big descriptive words. @PERSON1 for instance, he's one of my favorite poets; he's actually pretty famous for what all he has done. Well, he didn't become famous until after his death. Overall, not everyone has the same taste in books, magazines, movies or even poetry. We're all different even when it comes to this.
485	3462	2	3	How often do you find a book or a magazine that you don't want children or someone to read? I mean I find them everyday for example, how people use their language like swearing or even the tv show they watch. I also hear when I'm with my friends or in a crowd of people. You hear them everyday even if you don't want to, but you do. I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period. It's a public place and no one wants to see anyone with those books in the library. What would happen if a child got ahold of one and they were looking at it and it gave them nightmares or if it deals with crimes, rape, or mishaps with something wrong. Sometimes what children read, they will say it or they will do it. So if a child sees it they @MONTH1 think it's alright to do it or they might think it's amazing or cool to do and they might do it. Also again, you hear it on a daily basis like swearing. Let's say your child hears or reads horrible language and they might say it to you or some of your friends, and you won't know where they heard it or who told them. The movies even have something to do with it too, because if all the movies are together kids to adults movies, they should separate the movies or even get rid of the movies because the children could look at the case and see something scary or drug related, something that you don't want your children to see or even hear. Even though you hear them daily, you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around. They need to take those books that describe anything about crime, drugs, or even movies. That's why I think they should get rid of those books and movies off the shelves and get them away from children.
486	3463	2	3	I think they should not remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started taking these things out, there is a good possibility that you will lose everything, the books and your people, because the criteria for what is deemed offensive can be endlessly broad and subjective. One example I say this is because some people are offended by movies that have violent scenes in them. Others like the action and drama that the violence in those shows provides. The library might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like, especially if they cannot afford to purchase it themselves. Another example is that magazines can contain material you do not want your kids around or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with an assignment at school, providing crucial information or a perspective not found elsewhere. Kids might need the material that is offensive; it could help them through life by exposing them to difficult topics in a safe environment. In conclusion, I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offensive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in their education, offering valuable lessons about history or human nature. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching for entertainment or intellectual stimulation. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will, and we must respect the diverse needs and tastes of the entire community.
487	3464	2	3	Do people have the right to limit freedom? Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self expression? Many people in today's world think so. Book censorship is a big deal in the world today. Whether books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue. Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech. I believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination. All through life people are urged to think outside of the box. We are told as kids that being unique and different is a good thing. We are all told this and yet when writers express themselves in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing. Many people want to censor books so their children cannot read 'offensive' material. They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can shield their child from the bad things in the world. This is not the case. People may be able to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without books, through their peers or their own experiences. Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was a very scandalous book. Because of the language this book used, many people thought it was trash. Many people wanted it to be censored. Today The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of American history. And to think, if people back then would have removed it from the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book. It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was built on the idea of freedom. Under the constitution we are guaranteed freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech. No one should be allowed to tell you that you cannot read a book you want to read. No one should be allowed to tell you that you cannot write a book as you want to write it. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts. Making writers do that, limits their freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come? Book censorship and censorship in general, is not a good thing; all it does is limit things. If we start censoring books, we are giving a message to our children, that different is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be until our other rights are limited? Where will it end? Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to ask ourselves this, do we have the right to limit freedom.
488	3465	2	3	In my own personal opinion this letter to the newspaper with my views on censorship in libraries is that I think music, books, magazines, and etc should be stayed on the shelves. If they can get published they should be able to be read or listened to, as the very act of publication implies a level of societal acceptance and value. The things in this paragraph will be about the content of music, books, magazines, and etc. The music industry too many people think some songs are inappropriate but really that ruins the whole point of the whole entire song, which is to convey an artist's genuine emotion or message. Maybe it could be age advised but that is all they should do; they should not cut down the content. The magazines should be read or looked at by anyone because they are published materials. They should be allowed anywhere if they got published, as restricting them contradicts the principle of free access to information. Movies should be put in the library with age advice because someone had to allow that movie to go out in theatres, on television, or on the internet, meaning it has already passed certain standards. From my experience I have seen people complain about these things. I really do not get why you should complain about these things when you can simply choose not to engage with them. Now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries and consider the importance of access for all.
489	3466	2	3	What is censorship? Censorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can also be called common courtesy. The real question is what are we limiting? Censorship is not something to support. Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate; it is taking away the value and fun out of education. Though many individuals disapprove, libraries should not censor their books, movies, or music because of that singular perspective. Some individuals find that 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the controversial word. There is also some argument to that, there are several people that I know that find that word offensive, but not in this case. They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of Mark Twain the word was an accepted word. That is just how it was back then, and removing it whitewashes history. Back then and now censorship is hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considered 'inappropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free. The 'inappropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said in real life. By using censorship you are sheltering the world from its own reality. Censorship is a tool we use to block ourselves from reality. Is that the right choice? Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves, or should we let them understand how it really works through literature and media?
490	3467	2	3	Censorship. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson. I do not believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, then what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they are found to be offensive, then there will not be any books left to read, as virtually any book could offend someone. I have seen many offensive books. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I am sure it is offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, then what would the author who wrote the book think? Our world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It cannot be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, does not mean it offends everyone. I believe censorship is unnecessary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it is inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I would not want little kids to read but that does not mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book for their research or enjoyment. If I did remove it then I am restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book. Censorship in general is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I do not believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you will not approve of. Just because you do not approve of it does not mean everybody does not approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it is offensive? Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We should not just ban them because they offend certain people. If you do not like a book because it offends you, then do not read it. It is just that simple. If people continue to remove books because they are offensive, then there will not be any books left to read, and we will have lost a fundamental pillar of a free and educated society.
491	3468	2	3	If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive website, magazine, or movie. Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere, defeating the purpose of the removal. Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive. The Da Vinci Code is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs. While many people found The Da Vinci Code offensive, others enjoyed the story and its intriguing plot. If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then others who really enjoyed the book would not have been able to read it, limiting access to a popular work. Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive the whole way through. Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing, offering valuable lessons or entertainment. It is the same idea with a book or magazine. There might be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through. Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or articles. There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely. One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too inappropriate for their age level. But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to, as they are the primary guides for their children. Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints from patrons who feel their access is being unfairly restricted. I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk,' thereby allowing for individual choice and responsibility.
492	3469	2	3	Censorship in school libraries is important, but at the same time it is not necessary. I believe that many books in the school library are not appropriate for younger children, but these same books should not be taken out of our libraries because I feel like high schoolers are mature enough to be reading this material. The material in these books is no different than what goes on in the high school years or what teenagers discuss amongst themselves. Most of these books give a perspective on real life stories and might be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone in their struggles. At the same time though many of these books do contain curse words, some sexual scenes, partying, drinking, and doing drugs. These books are too old for an elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading. For example the books by Ellen Hopkins, these books are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregnant, in jail, and homeless. I read these books, they are really good books, and they showed me how by just trying one drug, one time, could ruin your whole life. I learned a lot from these books, but I don't think that anyone younger than fourteen should be reading them due to the mature themes. There should be a limit on the censorship. Many things talked about in the books, are the same things talked about in the school hallways, so what is the real difference? That is why authors write about the things they do, so they can connect with teenagers on their level. Many books are an author's experience, so they are meant for high school age readers. Many authors will put an age level on their books, like fourteen and older. Libraries should pay attention to these ratings before putting the books in the libraries to help guide their selections. Someone might become offended by what they read in a book, but I don't think that book should be taken off the shelf because of one person's complaint. If it becomes a bigger issue, than yes it should be taken off, but at the same time, that one book might be someone else's way of escaping the hardships in their life, providing them comfort. Many adults would disagree with my statements because they feel like if a teenager is reading about someone drinking, doing drugs, or having sex, then they are more likely to do those things. I feel like this is not true because the book I am reading now, they are partying and drinking, but I'm not out doing that myself. What is the difference between someone reading it in a book and seeing it on television or in a movie? I see many worse things on the internet than I read in books. Parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends getting into trouble. These are just my opinions, some people may agree with me and others may disagree, but I am going to stick with my opinions on this matter.
493	3470	2	3	Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. There are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves, according to some people. Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, 'banned.' Banned Books Week is often a week where people read all of the books that have been banned from school libraries. I participate in this school wide challenge because I disagree with banning books, as I believe it limits intellectual freedom. Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons, depending on your point of view. First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view. How would you feel if you spent around two years writing this story or movie for kids that got banned in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves? I don't think that many people would enjoy that feeling of rejection. I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal, but they are the creators of the stories we love. When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world, including newspapers, books, and magazines. Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see, and that effort should be respected. I feel like when books or movies get banned or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing, which is a terrible feeling. The parents point of view makes things a lot worse and more complicated. Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he or she wants you to read with him. You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate scene in the story. You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story! What do you do in that situation? Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book. Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere, like at a public library or online. How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone from their school? I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong to cause its removal. Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it, which must be acknowledged. When you take the book, movie or magazine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library. This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story from that location. If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea to restrict access. It makes the banned object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab interest in. If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie, which some parents might prefer. There are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries and what materials are available. My view on this topic was negative and I support that fully. If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story that they created. Many different people come across this issue and there are many different views on the topic, making it a complex debate. Next Banned Books Week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting banned from libraries and schools. I hope that you will too, and consider the importance of access to diverse ideas.
494	3471	2	3	Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I believe it should be, with a few different view points. For one, why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series? This seems unfair to those who do enjoy the stories. Two, there is over a million of us people out there and we all are not a like in many ways, including our reading preferences. Also, reading is one of those things that we differ with each other on greatly. One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories, than you have people out there who want something more intense to be able to read, like thrilling mysteries or dark fantasies. With all of us being different all over the world, it is natural that our tastes in literature vary. Humans have different taste in food, music, movies, and books, which makes life interesting. All people have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings, to me books are like religions not all of us are the same in that, and at the same time we are all freely living with our religion without any punishment, so why would you take away books that people love to read freely? This seems like a contradiction in a free society. To me, in my eyes is just not right to restrict access in this way. It's like taking candy away from a innocent baby because it will rot it's teeth out, which is an overreaction. What I mean by that is, that sure some books to people might offend them yet their might be some people out there being offensive to that persons books and so on, but as long as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out, than why take the candy away? Meaning if the books have each individual shelf with labels on what it was all about, which they do, then people can make informed choices. People wouldn't feel so offensive finding them in the wrong spot if the organization is clear. Looking at the point of views do you understand where I come from with this? We are all the same in our humanity, yet in books we find each other inside of them, finding ourselves into books and connecting with characters. I know many book readers with different types of tastes, and we all coexist peacefully. No matter who they were and who their friends were, we all are different and that is okay. To many people other than myself, would agree with that statement about diversity. So tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries when it ultimately restricts this wonderful diversity of thought and story.
495	3472	2	3	Books are a form of history, each telling a story from the past or presenting a unique perspective. In history we don't block any offensive events that take place, so why should we remove any books that have offensive material in them? It would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools that books provide, as they are essential for education. Books are a very important learning tool in today's schools and there is something new in every book that a kid can learn from, whether it's a vocabulary word or a life lesson. So even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing, which is a loss for their development. And doing this on purpose would be against everything that schools stand for, which is the promotion of knowledge and critical thinking. There are many different genres of books, but not everybody loves every genre, and that is perfectly normal. If a person only likes to read young adult books because it relates to their culture, which most likely will have offensive language and events play out, that is their choice. If you were to take this away from a young adult in school, once more this person would be missing out on books because now they are not interested in any of the books in the library that remain. This could discourage them from reading altogether. If you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opportunity you shouldn't do it, as education is paramount. But the fact is there are many reasons why you shouldn't remove any literature from library shelves, primarily because it limits access to information and the freedom to explore different ideas and stories that shape our understanding of the world.
496	3473	2	3	libraries shouldn't remove items just because some people find them offensive. People prefer different types of books, so removing some reduces the overall selection and variety available. A lower selection of books means fewer people have a compelling reason to visit the library, as their specific interests may no longer be catered to. This diminishes the library's role as a comprehensive resource for the entire community, ultimately weakening its value and appeal. A diverse collection ensures that everyone can find something that resonates with them, which is fundamental to a library's purpose.
497	3474	2	3	Can books, music, movies, and other materials be perfect for everyone? Everyone has their own opinion and beliefs on what materials are good, and what are not acceptable for the human mind. All over the world, young kids, young adults, and adults are reading books and magazines, listening to music, and watching movies. Those are all hobbies most people enjoy doing. Everyone reads different kinds of books, whether it's mystery, romance, or bible-based books; people read. Removing books, magazines, and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful, empty library. When people come and search for a book to read, they search for what they think they will enjoy. If they enjoy one thing, another person might not. They might find a book offensive, but does that mean everyone else is offended by the book as well? Taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book. Everyone is different; everyone has their own story, just like these books do. Magazines are like books; they are meant to be enjoyed. I believe some magazines might not be appropriate for some people, but that doesn't mean they should be taken off the shelf. It means that person should simply not read it. Magazines are made for all people to enjoy; that's why there are so many different kinds. They want to fit each magazine personally to each individual. Music is a primary entertainment people enjoy. There is a reason why there are so many different genres. The music industry tries its best to sort the music to your taste. Just because one song has stuff in it you don't like doesn't mean you can delete that song for everyone. Music is used in many different ways. It relaxes you, pumps you up, and is used for parties, events, and so many other things. All songs are different so you can use them however you want. To ban music because someone doesn't like it changes music forever; there would be no music left to listen to. People should be able to watch what movies they want. That's why there are ratings on movies. What is acceptable for teenagers may not be acceptable for young kids, so they simply should not watch it. If people banned all the movies they thought were inappropriate, there would be no rented movie stores, theaters, or success in the movie production industry. Everyone should know what kind of movies they like, and they should just watch what they like, and leave the other movies for the people who enjoy them. No, books, magazines, movies, and music cannot be perfect for everyone. Materials bring all different kinds of subjects and stories for everyone. Each material brings enjoyment to different people. To ban all the materials you believe are inappropriate will leave the shelves empty, creating a library that serves no one.
498	3475	2	3	I, as a student, a child, and a citizen of the United States, believe that every book should be allowed in any library. Books express feelings, emotions, etc., and the same is true for movies and music. If we don't have them, how will we be able to learn anything in this world? Each book out there has an explanation, a title, and a reason to be read. Today, millions of people read more and more because of all the books available. I do believe, however, that the reason every book should be in a library is because all of them are different. It doesn't matter what the book is about; some might seem offensive, but everyone has something that they dislike. There are many people out there that get defensive over things, for example, certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing, and even sports. We all have our own opinions; if you do not like a certain book because it has content that you don't like, then it's simple: don't read it, as others might like it. Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere to ensure access for all.
499	3476	2	3	Dear newspaper, In my opinion, I don't think that censorship in libraries should be applied to materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more. Censoring materials in the library could result in many problems. I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons. In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I disagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials. Many libraries in the world have censoring on their materials. I believe that libraries have a lot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicit content. Libraries shouldn't censor their materials, but in my opinion, they also shouldn't let underage children check out any kind of material that is only meant to be viewed by adults. Also, if computer access is offered to children, an adult supervisor should be nearby to make sure that no explicit content is being viewed. Censoring in libraries could result in many problems, such as customers not getting all the information they need for a certain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school. If all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials, then many libraries will not get as many customers. Yes, most people visit libraries for the wrong reasons, but to other people, those wrong reasons might be the reason for them to gain more information. Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people. But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people. If something is found offensive to one person, I don't think it should be removed from the shelves. If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain. In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that much information could be lost. Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad; it can also mean that the material is just not appropriate to be viewed or read by that certain age group. If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off. Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either, but it can hide a lot of information from us, which is not good at all for a society that values knowledge.
500	3477	2	3	I think that all books, music, movies, magazines, and anything that's offensive should be taken off shelves because there are little kids that read books and they don't need to hear or read offensive things. But at the same time, for the people that do want to hear or read things like that, then there should be a separate area in the library for materials like that. There are all kinds of libraries that have offensive books, movies, and magazines. Other reasons they should take offensive materials off the shelves include that it could be racist or just offending certain things, and people don't wanna see or read about white people hating black people or black people hating white people or any type of racist things. It shouldn't be allowed because it can hurt someone's feelings. I have my own observations with reading some books from my school library and have come across some words that were offensive, like in some books they use the word nigger, and since I'm black it's offensive to me. I know that they are not saying it to me, but they still say it and it kinda touches me in a way. I'm not saying that it is offensive towards all people, but it is to me, so the way they could fix it is, like I said, instead of having offensive books out on shelves, they should have one area where materials like that could be found instead of having the material where children and other people will get offended. The last thing I wanna talk about is that for children and other people, they don't wanna see nasty things that are in books. If I had a kid, I wouldn't want my children to see nasty things that could be offensive too. There are books also that talk about drugs, and people don't wanna hear or read about that. But there are some people also that do wanna see or read about things like that, like older people; they have different points of view about things, so that's why again there should be one area in libraries for materials like that. In conclusion, I think that people should hear me out and take in what I have to say because the materials that are in books, music, or magazines can be offensive to anybody; any race could be offended by what they see or read, so again there should be a designated place in libraries for that kind of content.
501	3478	2	3	Censorship is a significant consideration in the management of public libraries, which offer a wide array of materials including books, movies, magazines, and public computers for anyone to access. Kids love to go to the library to get books and just hang out with friends, enjoying the communal space. Strict parents might believe that certain books, magazines, and music are offensive and should not be available at the library, but that isn't what everyone else thinks. I believe people have different views about things, which is a fundamental aspect of a diverse community. There are people that think their kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it, while others think their kids seeing those offensive things will make them learn from it and understand the world better. Another thing that people believe is bad in libraries is the talking, as not everyone that goes to the library wants to just sit and not talk to anyone. Most people do not go to libraries because of that strict, silent environment, which can feel unwelcoming.  Libraries are fun to go to, as you can just about get any book there you want to read for education or entertainment. There is no point for any parent to be worried about their child reading a book that isn't for their age group, because libraries are very good at having the sections labeled for age groups, such as children, young adult, and adult. They also would not be able to check out the book because the staff there are good at making sure it isn't a book that shouldn't be read by that person, often enforcing policies on age-restricted materials. Also, most younger kids that go there are always with an adult, providing supervision. So the parent can keep an eye on their kid if she doesn't believe it's right for them to read the offensive books, guiding their choices. Parents should not let their kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad, as parental responsibility is key.  Talking at libraries is always fun because you can talk about the book you're reading or just hangout, making the experience social. The staff and people there get so mad if kids are laughing or talking about something, which can create a tense atmosphere. I think they should make a floor people can go to, to hangout and talk, designating specific areas for social interaction to accommodate different preferences. In libraries there are a lot of good things to do rather than bad things, and people always feel welcome there due to the inclusive environment. Books that people say are offensive are usually the interesting ones, as they often tackle complex or challenging topics. So if you do not want to see or your kids to see the offensive books and movies, you should make sure not to go in the adult section, utilizing the library's organizational system to navigate content appropriately.
502	3479	2	3	A library is a fundamental place to go and find books, music, and other informational things, serving as a community hub. It's a big resource for the public; it has a huge variety of help for people, from research materials to leisure activities. The central question is, should everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if it's found offensive by some? If books, music, or anything else on the shelves were found offensive, a proposed solution is that they should be removed off the main shelves. They should have a separate, designated section for those certain kind of materials, which would require special access. To access that certain material, you would have to have a librarian's permission, ensuring a controlled process, so that way it can't come off as offensive to anyone browsing openly. You're probably asking why you couldn't just leave it on the shelf for everyone. You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someone's cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth who might encounter it unexpectedly. So therefore, that's why they would have to be removed from general circulation and placed in a restricted area.  I do believe they should be removed for those various reasons, balancing access with community standards. Libraries are a place to go to be used as resources or for fun, aiming to serve all patrons. Everyone who goes to a library should have everything to their needs, but this must be managed in a way that respects differing sensitivities and protects younger visitors from potentially harmful content, ensuring a positive experience for all.
503	3480	2	3	Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age? No, it is not, as the whole situation of whether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and CDs restricted to certain people due to their age should not be an issue. My reasoning on that is not because of how it might influence people in a bad way, which is a common concern. Then again, it might influence them in a fantastic way, opening their minds to new ideas. That's how people find out who they are, such as what they're interested in, what they like, and what they want to do with their lives. If it wasn't for establishments such as libraries, most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves, leading to a less diverse society. People would be too similar and have little to no differences from others, stifling personal growth.  People should be aware of some of the content in books, exercising personal judgment. Just not to the point where those areas become restricted to certain age groups, which limits exploration. Movies and CDs are more understandable due to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicians and actors might use, as these are more direct sensory experiences. Except in a book, it's not what other people are doing and saying; it's what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interpreting the text. It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what you're reading and how you're reading it, engaging your own imagination and critical thought. That's why the whole situation of whether or not libraries should have certain things such as movies, books, and CDs restricted to a certain age group is flawed; instead, the solution is having the areas labeled on what the category is to know before looking, promoting informed choice. So therefore, that is my views and beliefs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people, advocating for open access with clear guidance.
504	3481	2	3	Many books in libraries have profanity, a feature that just depends on how you read and analyze the profanity within the context of the story. To some people, the strong words help the reader get the point across their head, adding realism and emotional impact. To others, the words are just offensive and unnecessary, detracting from the reading experience. I disagree that most books are offensive to readers; I believe that they just help the writers get their points across more effectively, using language as a tool. Many children come across books with offensive language, but if they only read books that are within their age level, which are carefully selected, then they shouldn't have these problems with inappropriate content. In adult books, there is more offensive language, but to adults' eyes and ears, it's a different story because they hear, and possibly say, a lot of the words that they are seeing in these books anyhow, making it less shocking.  I believe that any offensive reading material should be found through cataloging and then sent to a certain area of the library, like an adult section, where if you are an adult then you can check these books out. This is a practical way to keep the children away from these books, words, and to keep them 'innocent' still, as many parents desire. Children don't need to be reading books with offensive language anyhow, but of course, this is ultimately up to their guardian to decide and monitor. It's not necessarily a bad thing to have strong language in books, as long as the reader that has the book is taking it in the way the writer is intending, which is most likely to help the theme and narrative purpose. Children should be kept away from these books, but they should not be completely removed from the shelves, as they have value for adult patrons. They should just be put in their own area for adults to read only, maintaining access while providing a simple barrier for younger readers.
505	3482	2	3	All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age, striving to be inclusive institutions. The books on the shelf are arranged, or should be arranged, in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first, following a standard organizational system. I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, and movies, should be considered for removal due to some of the graphics or intense content in each reading material, based on community standards. Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelves, creating distinct sections. If a child would be in the appropriate aisle for their age-styled books, less children would pick up the wrong book by accident, reducing potential issues. If children would understand to listen and follow directions on where to find their specific age-appropriate books, perhaps with signs or librarian guidance, less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur.  If children would take the wrong age-appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would think that their parent(s) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child(s), teaching a valuable lesson. If parents would be responsible for taking immediate action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf and why it matters. Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, that they would learn not to do it again, learning through gentle correction? I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material, but this should be a careful, considered process. The books on each bookshelf are, or should be, arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first, maintaining consistency. Ultimately, all libraries have books for all readers no matter the age, and the goal is to manage the collection thoughtfully to serve everyone effectively while addressing legitimate concerns about content.
506	3483	2	3	In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive. Some find them more offensive than others. I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people may be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent. These resources are in the library for a reason. If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some may not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things, so personal choice should guide individual reading habits. In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they might need these resources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive by someone else. This would hinder academic and personal research. Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better. We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication. For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary, which is a clear benefit. So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these resources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being taken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out.
507	3484	2	3	I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies and magazines. Some of the books people need to know about. Take the concentration camps for instance, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happening again. The knowledge contained within such materials serves as a crucial historical record. I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the past. So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger. They can be in danger by someone being like Hitler and killing millions of jews just because they look different. Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human. So keeping them in shelves could help our future by teaching important lessons from history. Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn. My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever. These materials can serve as cautionary tales. In conclusion, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horrible historical events form happening again and preserve our collective memory.
508	3485	2	3	I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. Our world is far from perfect. One reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedom of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are. The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. Kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content. Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in our imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up and learning. Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of our nation's libraries. When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. They are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for this great country. People came here for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down. People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against our nation to censor things in libraries. My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. Take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone may want that offending book for research or personal interest. These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not belive libraries should be censored. Our world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus this act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them. If libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in our world because there are many things in this world that are 'offensive' to atleast someone.
509	3486	2	3	I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. The library offers a vast selection for a reason, catering to diverse tastes and needs. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else I observed. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. The decision to engage with certain materials rests solely with the individual patron. Everyone has their own choice on what they listen to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in and what supports a free and open access to information.
510	3487	2	3	Everything is offensive to someone. There is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all. If there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it. Here is a good scenario; there is a childrens book. It is one of the greatest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and there is a racist comment in it. So good bye to that book. Some people would probably think 'So what its only a childrens book. I'm sure we will survive.' But lets move on to a bigger idea. What happens when someone says the bible is offensive. Then thats gone, but now its supports are saying the other people's entire religion is offensive. Thats a couple more books. Now we have violence. Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes. Obscene images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship. Censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. To strip the rights of a person is not acceptable. The American government has given people freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. This basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want. A book is a form of speech. Although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored. Censorship is just basically saying; 'you can not say this.' That moves on to; 'you can not say.' then; 'you have no say.' In developing countries, such as congo, if you go to the goverment and say what they are doing wrong and that you are agianst them, take a guess at what happens. They shoot you. A better word for that would be they censor you. If you write a book saying how obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens. They censor you. Now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of obama dont want you to. Do you see much difference? Supervision is a powerful thing. Guess what it can do better then censorship. With a supervision, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it. A person is a human being. That includes children. They have a right to learn without the influence of others, but censorship denies them of that right. Censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away freedoms and opportunities for children. It causes violence among people. It scars culture, and ignores religion. Although censorship has the ability to do more damage then any single person, it is not 'bad'. Censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong. But good intentions do not keep wrong consequences at bay, and the harms of censorship far outweigh its intended benefits.
511	3488	2	3	With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion. I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people. So, with this way I would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books. This system could use clear labels or signs for different topics and themes. So with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. If there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. Even though, I, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things. If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. This would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself. I would not like any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, I believe you will start taking out more than one. With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. So please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. Thank you for your time to read this, I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more. Also, maybe publish some too, into the newspaper, so that more people can consider this practical idea.
512	3489	2	3	Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs? Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions? Where's that one place where you can experience all of those? In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library you have the right to have an open mind and explore diverse perspectives. I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries, as every item could potentially offend someone. If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements. Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way, by freely choosing the materials that resonate with them.
513	3490	2	3	The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason. The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library who may wish to access that very material. Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being. There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair, such as designated sections. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do for a community space that serves everyone.
514	3491	2	3	I personally dont think there should be any censorship in books coming into a @CAPS1. I think its wrong to do so, because any book should be read know matter what is said in it. Anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone for others who may want to. Now ive not really seen anything that i'd fine offensive, but ive read somethings with words i was sort of was suprised to see. But nothing that i found offensive personally. Books are there for their own purpose, and thats another reason why authors put them out there for the public to think what they want of it. The freedom to choose what we read is a fundamental part of a library's purpose, and censorship undermines that very principle for everyone.
515	3492	2	3	In this life time we will all have our own oppinions about topics and problems in the world. There is a question that ponders in my mind. Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right? If i was a parent, I think I would be able to understand why I mite want to have a book removed from a shelf, but the thing is though, it is unconstitutional to do that. That is why in my oppinion censorship in libraries should not be aloud. When I was twelve, one time at the library I was reading the back of a book, and my mom approached me and told me that book was a little too graphic for me to be reading. It was about the @CAPS1. Now that I am older, I realize why my mom wouldn't want me to be reading a book like that at that age. That is one reason I can understand why some one would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can not do that because, that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again. I also think that everyone has there right of an oppinion on why somthing should be, or not should be done. One thing that I have obserbed, is that when kids read bad things, and look at bad things, it can really have a big impact on there life as what they do in the future, and there present. That reason it's self is a very good explanation on why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries posted on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age, or if the child wants to read a certain type of book, the child must have a legal gurdian with them at that time. With that being said, I have come up with, what I believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries. I think that any book that mite have somthing that is a little bit appropriate should be put into a section that is rated just like movies. If somthing has a little bit of inappropriate language such as cursing, these books should be put in a section for people over the age of thirteen just like a movie. Basically, the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie. If the book is rated @CAPS2, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it. This idea could be a really good solution, that way no books would be removed, but also these books will be kept out of harms way of children. Honestly, if I was a parent I would not want my children to indulge in reading of books that talk about sex, violence, and vulger, but also it is my belief that we all have our own oppinion, and have the right to be able to read and see what we want. On thing I think we all need to think about is things that have been done in the past that have had huge benifits on our country. Our four fathers, more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1. This document has amendments. These amendments state that we have the right to speak, have oppinions, and read what we want because, we should have the right to live a free life. To remove books from the shelves is unconstitutional, and I don't know about you, but I know that all the people that have gone against the constituotion have not found a great place in this world. My basic belief is that, why remove a book from a shelf, when we can impervise so everyone is happy? If the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution. There is an answer for this, books should not be burned they are master pieces. Cencorship can not continue in libraries or there won't be any books left for future generations to learn from and enjoy.
516	3493	2	3	I think books that have nudity, curse words, or gang related violence should be put in either a special adult shelf or taken off for good. They show kids stuff they shouldnt see or do when they get older, exposing them to concepts they are not mature enough to handle. They just arent appropriate for a young and impressionable audience. No childeren should know about drugs, sex, or epspecially gang violence at such a tender age. Its stuff they should never even find out about until they are much older and can understand the context and consequences. So i think we should take them books off the shelf in the children's section, if people want to read them they can go buy themselves a copy from an adult store or a separate section designated for mature content only.
517	3494	2	3	NO, I think books and ect. should be tooking down off selves if they are offensive! It's a free country and they have they will to freedom of speech, which protects the right to publish diverse materials. No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opioin on what is acceptable. As long as it's apporiate for the enviroment and its surronds, like a library or a school, there should'nt be any problems with having a wide variety of books available. If we took down the books people said offened them we would'nt have any books left on the shelves at all. Everyone has their own opioin about things and diffrent views, so what is offensive to one person might be educational to another. It's most likely that someones goin to get offened by something in a book at some point. In some cases it makes a person better at wat their doing to be offened and to learn from that experience. Some offensive things are part of history and shows how things progressed from back then to now, providing valuable lessons. What's a child without it's history? It would be ignorant. Out of all the people who should be mad or think they should be offened is the people the stories are about, but their not complaining about the books and etc. then no one should. You know jus as well as I know that most of the movies are about how we got whipped and sold back in slavery, and books about how only a couple of us made it through those struggles. Magazines about how we sex and kill each other, and papper telling how are black communties are failing are also common. So in my opioin, no books should be tooken of the shelfs if there found offenisve. It was going on before we got here and when we leave it's still going to be going on, so we cannot hide from it. It's apart of life and there's no better way to find out about things if you don't see it yourself in books and other media. People always saying kids should read more to gain knowledge. What's to read if you take all the books down thats offensive? There would be very little left to learn from.
518	3495	2	3	I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves, to those who they are offending, but this is a complex issue that requires a balanced approach. I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me personally. I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps, to accommodate everyone's sensibilities without resorting to removal. First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it by expressing their concerns to librarians or store managers. Finding a way to reach a happy medium is key to resolving this conflict. If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf just because they disliked it, there wouldn't be any left in my opinion, which would be a great loss. If people find it offending they should simply stay away from those certain types books or movies and choose something else that suits their tastes. Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies and enjoy them for their artistic or entertainment value. Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to just because someone else has a different opinion. If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers and revenue, which hurts everyone. Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me, we need a practical solution. I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way that respects all parties. Instead of organizing solely by author or genre, they should be organized by age restrictions and content warnings. Just like rated R movies, or rated M video games, which have clear labels. Books and music can be organized in this fassion also, with sections for general audiences and sections for mature content. It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around, while others can easily find what they are looking for. In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or magazine off of a shelf is not very smart or practical. One, its not fair for people who are not offended and wish to access that material. Two, buisnesses will lose customers and limit their offerings. Three, there is a better way to solve this problem through organization and labeling, which satisfies most people.
519	3496	2	3	Dear, Newspaper editor I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library, I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library for anyone to see. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude and out of place in a public, shared space. It also came to my attention that magazines arn't the only form of crude murchandise on the selves of our local libraries that could cause discomfort. They are also littered with movies with violent covers, books with explicit themes, graphic posters, along with, what i find to be explicit music lyrics in the audio section. I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the complete removal of the murchandise, as others have a right to access it, but I would like to display a comprimise that could come into play to benefit everyone. What I believe to be crude, another person may for some be acceptable, which is why we need a solution that works for all, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased by the content? I believe that I have come up with a very simple comprimise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the murchandise avaiable for those who want it. Now most, to all should know that there are children sections in most, if not all libraries, which are separated for a reason. So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own special section, perhaps with a sign, that way customers whom seek the material now know were to go to recieve it without it being in the main area. This way, I believe would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library for families and sensitive individuals. The benefits of this comprimise seem endless, to me and many others I have spoken with. This way the children are left with a safe enviroment to pick out their books without accidental exposure, and the adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library without being confronted by such material. Though I am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material, I think it would help them as well. This way all of the material they want can be found in one concentrated place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it, making their visit more efficient. I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family friendly enviroment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library expierence without encountering unexpected offensive content. This compromise allows for both access and comfort, maintaining the library as a welcoming space for all members of our community. Thank you for your time, A Concerned Patron
520	3497	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' This statement makes me think, well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it because of its content. Maybe there parents should look at the books first to see what is inside or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf themselves if they were so concerned. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf to protect children from harmful ideas. If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books that depict graphic violence. If a book is based on a true story and it is offensive it should be heard anywise because it is part of history, even if it is unpleasant. Everyone needs to hear it because it is true and we must learn from the past. If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language and inappropriate themes. For movies children should only whach G or PG rated movies and nothing else that is more mature. For magazines children should not read adult magazines they should be taken off the shelfs in the kids' area. The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language, which I am thankful for now. But I could read any book I wanted to from the library. It was in a book and it was not like I could onder stand what that bad ward ment or the context at such a young age. I think the author is saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights to choose what they read. And then she states that their wont be any books left for us if we start removing them. I think that means every book could be considered bad by someone if shes saying that, i think shes pointing out the flaw in removal. Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., on the shelfs without causing problems. Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children and what they are checking out. And no, parents should not just ignore what their children are reading; they should be involved. To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs to ensure a safe environment for all young readers.
521	3498	2	3	In a library, censorship should be controlled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf through a democratic process. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rating once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them personally. Of course there are some books that adults may not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundary of what rating of book their child can check out, perhaps through a parental control system. Organizing the books this way anybody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf, fostering mutual respect. In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books, so to prevent a power struggle this way a committee should be set up to decide what books to purchase, representing diverse community interests. you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it in a community that values diverse access. The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the library also, the books are just books whether you read them or not is your choice, and their presence upholds intellectual freedom. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library, reflecting educational goals. In short my view of book censorship is that, the library will choose the books that go into the library based on community input. To make things easier the books should have a rating system that would be the national standard for all public libraries, ensuring consistency and clarity. Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them, and that personal responsibility is the cornerstone of a free society.
522	3499	2	3	Do you think books, magazines, or movies that are offensive should be removed from the shelves of stores and libraries? In my opinion, I think that the boss or manager of the stores should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to adults and kids, as they have a duty to maintain a comfortable environment. Today I will inform you of several reasons why bosses or managers should remove books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids. One reason why the bosses and managers should remove books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries is that sometimes kids go to the stores and when the parents are about to pay for what they are going to buy, kids always get a magazine or a book and start reading it and probably the magazine or the book have something nasty or inappropriate for kids and they should not be looking at it, and the parents do not pay attention to what their kids are looking at, leaving the children exposed. Another reason why the bosses and managers should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of the stores and libraries is that for some people when they look at the magazines or books front cover and they see a picture from their culture or traditions and the people who did the magazine or the book wrote something about their culture or tradition that the person thinks that was not right or might not be true, and the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition, causing unnecessary distress. My last reason why bosses or managers should remove the books, magazines or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries is that when I go to libraries and I see these little kids looking at the books or magazines and the magazines look nasty or inappropriate I get questionable and in my mind I said 'why don't the bosses or managers remove the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or inappropriate and that might be something bad to show them. If the libraries should be good for kids/teenagers and adults for study in the libraries they should not have offensive books or magazines that could disrupt the learning environment. In conclusion, I think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should remove the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries because they might be offensive to some people and more for their kids, ensuring a safe and respectful space for all patrons. I have already explained my reasons why the bosses and managers should remove the books or magazines from the shelves of stores and libraries.
523	3500	2	3	I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place, representing a gift of knowledge and perspective. Also, I don't think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in their lifetime, providing valuable historical and emotional insight. Look at it and try to live life as you would in another persons shoes, developing empathy and a broader worldview. Try to see where they come from and their life style, understanding different circumstances and choices. I'm not a big reader or anything but once I get that one book that just catches my eye and sounds good to read I look at it and if it is good I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book, getting completely absorbed in the narrative. So I keep reading and reading and like in the middle of the story my teacher makes me stop reading, which is frustrating when you are engaged. I would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me, one that truly sparks my interest and imagination. I like all kinds of books from sports to sad emotional books, enjoying a wide range of genres and themes. I like reading out loud to myself it helps me understand a little bit better, making the words and story more concrete and personal. The freedom to access all books is essential for this personal journey of discovery and learning.
524	3501	2	3	There should not be any style of censorship in the library. I am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes. I understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but I do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves, as this undermines their fundamental purpose. In the US we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles, and religions; this is one reason I think censorship is against American policy and our core values of liberty. One of the things that sparked our countries secession from Britain, was censorship. The King would not allow the colonies news papers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies; this is why when the US was formed the Founding Fathers built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution, protecting it as a fundamental right. I do, however, agree with some censorship in specific contexts. The movie and song rating system is a form of censorship I believe to be needed, providing guidance to consumers. Without this form of censorship, small children would be allowed to see and hear things they are not ready for, which could be harmful. This is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the material rated, making an informed personal choice. I think that there should be a rating system (or explanatory system) present in libraries as a practical compromise. Instead of pulling controversial books off the shelves completely, we should rather put a warning on them to alert potential readers. I feel strongly that I have a right as an American to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I would like to see, exercising my intellectual freedom. If we start restricting what we as citizens are allowed to see, we start losing our freedom; we become like those who live in communist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen, a path we must avoid. The statement made by Katherine Paterson supports my ideals greatly; especially 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. This sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offensive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy, leaving shelves barren. Censorship in the library is a direct violation of our constitution and the principles it was founded upon. I am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, don't read it, taking personal responsibility for your own consumption. By doing this we can get rid of censorship, and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as citizens in a free and open society. We also allow our right to be informed to be exercised without undue restriction or fear.
525	3502	2	3	Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have their own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about, reflecting a diversity of creative voices. If the author chooses to write something that you do not necessarily agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material; the power of choice rests with the individual. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, a fundamental aspect of personal freedom. They can do and say what they want, though sometimes those opinions may have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want, accepting the associated responsibilities. As an author you provide a book to the public, if it gets that far through the publication process. When a book is published then it is sent to a library so that you can choose to read it if you would like, making it accessible. A book should not be taken off the shelf if someone finds it offensive, as that is a subjective judgment. Someone else may not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material, finding value where others do not. When a movie is made and it is 'R-rated' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie, exercising simple consumer choice. They do not stop playing it because someone may have different feelings about the movie, recognizing that one person's dislike should not dictate universal access. If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it; the solution is personal avoidance. Someone else may enjoy something that you do not, and that is a normal part of a pluralistic society. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on what's offensive and what's not, as perspectives vary widely. You can not always make everyone happy, so attempting to do so through removal is futile. If the book becomes a problem and a majority amount of people think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf through a democratic community process. If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it, a right that should be protected. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that, balancing different preferences. If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take it off the shelf when they just do not have to read it? Personal responsibility, not preemptive removal, is the most equitable solution.
526	3503	2	3	Censorship is a controversial topic. Some believe that it is necessary, while others would disagree. My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary. Everyone is entitled to what they believe, and others have to have the maturity to accept that. Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material then don't read or listen to it. It is as simple as that. Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left. If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section, which shows the impracticality of such a system. Because censorship is controversial there are many different thoughts on the subject. It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship, my view being just one of many. Censorship is truly just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material. The only person who can let you be offended is yourself, therefore censorship is not necessary in the library; people just need to be mature about it and make their own responsible choices.
527	3504	2	3	I think they should remove it if the public thinks its offensive. I think it should be that way about every thing. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. I'm not saying that it will be taken care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offended all the time. Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was something that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I avoid whatever it is. I rarely change my ways though. Sometimes that is a bad thing, but who hasn't made a mistake or two? This is really hard for me to write about because I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offended. I do know some people that get offended easy though. I try to stay away from them because you have to watch what you say all the time. To me that's no fun; I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essay. I bet there would be a lot less drama too but I don't know. If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offend you, just don't read it again. It might not offend the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from whatever it is that is bothering you. After a while you will forget about it. I guess if it really, really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. If there is only a handful of people saying they are offended then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay, and that seems like the fairest way to handle things.
528	3505	2	3	I do not think that anything is really offensive so I wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get offended so I don't know what some things would be offensive, but I guess that black people would be offended by a racist book? I don't think that porn or anything involving nudity should be used in school library's because some parents are very strict about that kind of stuff and that is very inappropriate for school. I think some parents take it over the top with what's inappropriate and what's not. Library's that are just public library's are totally different and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what they're about. If the people don't like it they don't need to look at it or get it. So, I think that library's should have all different kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it then they can leave, and don't have to worry about it. That is what I have to say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or persuaded you a little bit to see that a public space should cater to a wide variety of tastes and interests.
529	3506	2	3	I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves. I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want. The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse for not paying attention. The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies, and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days children learn about things sooner and sooner. The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it. That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it, which is a reasonable compromise for everyone involved.
530	3507	2	3	How can writing be offensive? Many people find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive. Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and someone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' People can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out. I believe we have a choice to either accept or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgement. We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read. Everyone sees things differently. What about children, can we trust their better judgement? I fear that children don't have as great of judgement as more mature adults. The responsibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age. Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them. If libraries did do censorship it would deny us our rights and freedom to speak our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it. We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the British. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. Just think if they would have censored those ideas. Would we still be under British rule today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censor our reading but that we should use our better judgement to navigate the vast world of ideas.
531	3508	2	3	In today's society it is easy to find small things that offend people, whether it is politics or religion. The truth is no one is able to keep everyone happy. A major debate of today would be that of the media and censorship. Should people have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person? The answer is no. Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and knowing everyone can find something that is offensive. When America was finally free from British rule a main goal was to have our freedom of speech. This was a huge achievement for the founding fathers. Allowing people to remove material from our shelves would be breaking the one rule we worked so hard to gain. People today rely on being able to speak their minds to be a part of their government. Another law that Americans appreciate is, freedom of the press. Being allowed to write how they feel is what this nation is practically based on. Without this, wouldn't we be back into the old ways that our ancestors fought to change? This is a question you must think about when making this important decision. Finally, a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something. It is easy to find someone that is offended by the smallest of things. What happens when someone decides to find the Bible offensive to their religion? Do we take it off the shelf and tell the church sorry? If we decided to allow this, would there even be books, movies, music, or even magazines left for us? It is easy to assume just to take a book off the shelf because it's offensive to you, but what happens when we allow this to everyone? That is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this, it is going to take much more thinking than a couple of days. We must remember though the rights we are given as citizens; the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and we must always think about how this is going to affect our later generations.
532	3509	2	3	From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains. I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents may not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves. Inappropriate items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavior. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so. Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of Ellen Hopkins books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it? From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely important. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the Ellen Hopkins books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, Glass, and Fallout is a trilogy of books that show the life of a family. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as the daughter starts to walk with the monster, also known as addiction. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things the character does to herself, and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do those 'offensive' things. From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material forever.
533	3510	2	3	I believe that there should not be censorship because we live in America, a country that believes in freedom and I do too; censorship is not the way. My thoughts about people that find a book offensive should just not read the book if they heard it was a bad book or they didn't like the way the cover looks; that's their problem, don't ruin it for everyone else that likes the book. Say if two people found a book offensive and five people liked the book, does that mean that it should be removed? What if you were one of those five people and your favorite book was gone and you asked why and the librarian said 'well two people flagged the book for being offensive so it was removed'? I am not a book person but one time in school we read a book as a class called Fahrenheit 451; I thought it was a good book for its time. I heard that some people wanted to ban the book and some people did. Two words for those people: not cool. I think if you walk into a library you should expect to see a lot of different ideas because that's freedom and the world isn't perfect. So what I am saying is they should come up with a new system for libraries; if a majority of people flag a book offensive and they don't want their kids seeing it, then they should separate those books, movies, magazines, etc., from everything else, not remove them. A message to those people: If you are one of those people that finds a specific book offensive you should know where they are and stay out of that side of the library. That's my thoughts and views on censorship in libraries.
534	3511	2	3	Many of us have been at the library once in our life time, but have you ever had a day when you took your little kids to the library and they grab a book or a magazine and saw something that you were not very happy with? Well many of us have. Should the library have books, magazines, or even movies that are offensive to your kids, little brother/sisters, or friends? The public library should be for anyone and everyone to come and do what they have to do, not to see a naked picture or something that can be offensive to you or your the little kids. Well we can do something about that. Having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship. The books, magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves. A lot of the parents do not want their kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive. They also do not want them to be checking out movies that can give them bad influences. In the library there should be good and fun books, magazines, and movies. The people that work at the library should remove all the bad items. Allowing to have all the naked pictures and movies at the library will allow some teens to get bad ideas from it. This is why the libraries should remove all this books, movies, magazines, and even music! Many of the older people sometimes think that it is not fair for them. Well they should know that it can harm their kids and it can also teach their young kids bad stuff. Some of the older people sometimes think different and others they sometimes think the same. Many of the parents do not want their kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books. That's why removing these items are good for many of the kids and young teens that are just learning how to have a boy/girlfriend and need proper guidance.
535	3512	2	3	Libraries are public for a reason, and that is to interest people with different types of entertainment. I know some people have their opinions about things but that is why there are varieties because every single person is different. In my opinion no I do not think certain materials should be banned because they sometimes have a more mature content than others think is appropriate. Disagree with me that is alright but, have you ever stopped to think about issues like this? I'm going to list a few reasons with explanations on my opinion because I think they sometimes point out a few good concepts on why I do not believe they should be banned. First, in the present society everybody has different views and opinions on things that should be discussed. The public has a right to entertain themself any way they would like to choose and with any material or subject matter they would like. Taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like, or drive the car they want. If you were to walk into a library and see a subject that does not fit your standards or interest than you should simply walk away and find a more suitable subject matter for yourself. Some people look at things in a totally different way than you, and just because you do not like different styles of entertainment does not mean somebody else doesn't. Second, you would be taking jobs away from many people who love what they do. People have an issue with some content of books, or movies, but that is sometimes based on what an author is feeling, or even what their life maybe like. Others they write about real life events, things that happen to normal people everyday, that should be looked up upon to have people write their stories down for the whole world to see. Criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art. Pretty much what people feel like is, its not ok to have a mature subject discussed about in a book but in a painting it is, very hypocritical. Lastly, if the material being published today was wanted off the shelves of a library, than why would it even be printed and sold to people all over the world? It is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me is not bothered by it what so ever. In my opinion I do not think any form of entertainment should be banned or taken away from society in any way, because then you would be taking peoples joy and their right to choose.
536	3513	2	3	In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I believe there should be some censorship to some extent. Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things. I mean, they do use the Dewey Decimal System in every library I've been in. But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well. I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother. I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before. Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand. Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, but I still looked through them all. I mean, it was something very new to me; almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music. There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands. But this perked my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic images. The worst were books with cuss words that I found. Innocence in the library was gone. I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people; not including children. Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to realize that. I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time. In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship. I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it to protect the curiosity of children from content they are not yet ready to understand.
537	3514	2	3	The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true, I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon. I remember when I was younger and I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library, I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people. I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish. Another time something like this occured was when I was in a bookstore and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magazine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half, talk about having issues, anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well. There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things, one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it. But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door, it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote, 'Actions speak louder than words'. This reminds us that destroying or removing materials is a far more damaging action than simply choosing not to engage with them.
538	3515	2	3	My views on censorship may not be what others believe. With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call inappropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelves is easier. Although many people might think that a certain book is appropriate, others may disagree. That's why creating a rating system would be best. With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed. I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur. I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they may be more inappropriate than the normal. What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'inappropriate usage'? There is no way of making everyone completely satisfied, but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved. My views on censorship may not be what others believe, but taking away perfectly written books is not right. Disagreement isn't the easiest thing, but just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to give up. The rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions, fostering both access and informed choice.
539	3516	2	3	Books are gateways to other worlds. Today there are books on almost any topic anybody could dream of. People use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves. Now the content of some books are not always appropriate. Schools try to provide books that appeal to all audiences, but that ability is being impaired by books being banned from shelves. Students then can't read a book simply because someone else didn't approve of the content. That is unfair and should be stopped. Students should have the right to make choose what they want to read, yet some people want to take that right away from students. Students are also able to make choices on what's appropriate for them to read. If lawmakers give in to the complaints of a few people it could hinder a students rights and make students believe that they are not trusted. The content of what goes into a book is up to the author. The books someone decides to read is up to that particular reader. Sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them. Now some people think that because a book is inappropriate in their views then it shouldn't be available to read at all. This is unfair not only to any potential reader of that book, but also the author who worked hard to write that book. Students are smarter than many people give them credit for. They know what they should and shouldn't be reading, but if the choice of what they read is left up to other people they feel betrayed and untrusted. Students have as many rights as people who don't go to school. If books are being taken off shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate. Now the students freedom to choose what they want to read is gone, and all that remains is books chosen worthy by other people. Rights are something guaranteed to students as they enter school, but now rights are slowly being taken away from students. The right to choose what book they read is one that should not be taken. As author Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If one person says they think a book should be taken away, then another person wants another book taken away, until the point where no books are left then how will students ever get to read? Books are essential to a students growth into adulthood. If people gain the right to take books off shelves then music, movies, magazines will all get taken off shelves too. Books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world. Students have the right to choose what books they read, as well as the ability to know what they should read. Books should remain where they belong, in schools on the shelves, accessible to all.
540	3517	2	3	Do you think there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in libraries? Well here's my perspective. I think that libraries shouldn't have certain books due to racism, violence, and etc. One, because there are young children that read books throughout the library, and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect. can be offensive to others. How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that? That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age. A child's mind is impressionable, and exposure to such harsh themes can be confusing and frightening. It is the responsibility of the library to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all patrons, especially the youngest ones. So that's my perspective on it; some level of filtering is necessary to maintain that environment for learning and growth.
541	3518	2	3	There are many materials in libraries that are offensive to certain people. I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library, perhaps a designated area for mature content. Almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another. It might be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuality. I know little kids wouldn't understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever, and a separate section would help parents guide their children's choices. If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest person I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and says something funny to go with it. Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someone's sexuality. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governor turns around and says something, someone else will take it way too serious. Many people who are different because they don't like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers become young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life. So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they think are offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the world. I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a separate area of the library isn't a bad idea. Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them.
542	3519	2	3	Some books are offensive to some people. But everyone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldn't censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find a book offensive from the beginning, they can find another book to read or talk to the teacher about an alternative assignment. I have had my experience with books that are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book I have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain audiences. I had people come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. That's all you have to do and not make anything big about it; a simple conversation can resolve the issue. I also read the book, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', which is censored in some states because it's hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an African-American man who was accused of rape when he never committed such a thing. That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. It's a great story about what black people went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive. He got harassed and his children got harassed but he still fought with all he had to save his defendant. I am a fourteen year old boy who when he read this book, knowing who had a heart and who didn't, made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is definitely one of the best books I have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway. I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say it's gonna offend this kind of people and that's it. How do they come up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it; whoever doesn't read it doesn't have to or they can talk with their teacher. It's not so hard to decide to censor something when it's only your opinion. That's why I would look into the opinion of others before making such a decision. All in all censorship shouldn't be allowed. It ruins the opportunity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read at least in high school when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want and form their own opinions.
543	3520	2	3	Censorship being as touchy a subject as it is, in my belief should be very rarely upheld. Yes, I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a children's library or a children's section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take one's freedom of speech and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than un-American. Censorship exceptions should definitely be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library for younger grades. Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship; ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward un-censorship, right? Wrong. Although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents' choice and full responsibility regarding their children's censorship needs. I myself, when I am a parent, am going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it may be. The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering. Yes, the reason we censor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves; after all that is what a work of art is. Whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show, it shows a distinct look into the creator's mind and beliefs. To censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator, thus violating the freedom of speech and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear. I call this a touchy subject because when there is children's welfare involved it is always a touchy subject. To prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inappropriate, I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as a children's library or children's television networks. But as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to. To solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material?' Well yes and no. I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored versions. This would open up opportunities for children to read more advanced literature in an appropriate form, will not take away from the personal expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it in its original state.
544	3521	2	3	If materials are offensive they should not be displayed publicly where anyone can see them. Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age. I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed from general circulation. Materials at libraries are not for everyone. A lot of it is especially not for young children. For example: a young child could be wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting to him/her. The movie could be rated R but the parents still check it out for them. Once they watch the movie, it might have some heavy language, sex-related humor or content. Then the child is learning and seeing all of this happening in a motion picture. Also if they have nervous parents, the library could get some complaint calls. Today, a lot of younger children about ten and up have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inappropriate conduct in it, often accidentally. People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in the book. If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them and they might feel disrespected. If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them. They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material about its content beforehand. With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch. Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say and describe. Library materials must be checked for such content regularly. If they are found offensive, and proved offensive through a fair process, they should be moved to a restricted access area or removed entirely to maintain a comfortable environment for all patrons.
545	3522	2	3	People have different opinions; what one person may find extremely offensive another may not care about or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries, as it infringes on fundamental rights. One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we really have that freedom then censorship violates it completely. Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion. They have a right to speak for what they believe in, whether it be through magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. The author or artist may use those mediums to spread his/her ideas and beliefs, which is their right. Another reason is people's diverse opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender, country, culture, race, or religion? Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone may believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these things. A man may find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him may find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other, which is natural. Personal experiences also have a place in this discussion. Maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book. Maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song. These personal stories help inspire people and connect with others. No person can tell them it's wrong just because they think it's offensive or wrong for themselves. All these things factor in. No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom to access information and art. I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too after considering these points about liberty and individual choice.
546	3523	2	3	Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly other unhelpful information? @DATE1 when searching through the library you never know what @CAPS3 will find on the shelves. Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. But there's always that one @CAPS2 that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching! I strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves. When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye. Most of these books resulting to violence, with exciting covers and dramatic plots. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay and a normal way to solve problems. Also magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @CAPS3. @DATE1 our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book. Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound; the real-life consequences are often hidden. What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. When I was younger, I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all. As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries @DATE1 to ensure a safer and more educational environment for everyone.
547	3524	2	3	Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appauling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests. Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot about different perspectives and historical contexts. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education and our understanding of the world. Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them. The solution to library censorship is not removal, but the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them. Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom, and a library should be a place that reflects this principle for all.
548	3525	2	3	People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons. One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books in the future. Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person. Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem. There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for such drastic action when more reasonable alternatives exist.
549	3526	2	3	Do you think that certain books, music, magazines are sometimes found very offensive? If I had kids I wouldnt want my kids to be around any of these bad things. I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and childern become better people in the world. There are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see. When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff kids think that it is cool to do drugs so they start to do them and then they cant stop! You want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does. We need to encourage our children to be great people but we cant with drugs and volience that goes on around them, but we can try to banned the bad books, movies, and music. We need more good things to influence our children, like stories of success and positive role models. We dont want our chilren to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular. If your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them. I listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life and I know the difference between entertainment and reality. These are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children. If you want your children to be successful then you will keep your kids away from the volience and drugs. I know what kind of things happen when you dont keep them away. You dont want these things to happen to your kid so keep them away from it for their own well-being and future.
550	3527	2	3	There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect and that life can be complicated. People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things. With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies, and that is no way to manage a library for everyone.
551	3528	2	3	Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. Others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they might be. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it. Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them. If parents don't want their children seeing those things, they shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision. In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children, perhaps even in a separate, designated room. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it. Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I think it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch. Thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there. If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults might find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children I wouldn't want them seeinig things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. Having music, magazines movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it, as this is the most balanced and fair solution for everyone involved.
552	3529	2	3	There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Some people may like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials might be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries. Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it; they can simply choose a different material. Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the Holocaust. There are thousands of books on the Holocaust and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences. The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the the time to create the work, then they should recieve credit for making it. In the United States, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances, such as if it actively promotes violence or illegal acts. The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are, as access to a wide range of ideas is crucial for an educated public.
553	3530	2	3	Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed. Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child might take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting. I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of thirteen should not be watching movies that are rated R-17. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material may be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your five year old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library. Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library to protect young minds from content they are not yet ready to process.
554	3531	2	3	One might walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, 'Why is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries. In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and can be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine. When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated R, PG-13 or that is unrated, so why would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated 'M' or 'A' for mature. In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out Seventeen magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother may not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that might open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting. If libraries censored books better, then children and teens would not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'm not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully to ensure they reach only the intended audience.
555	3532	2	3	This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive, should be removed from shelves in libraries. I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries. I think that if they are very offensive, then they should be taken out; but if they are just mildly offensive, then i think they should stay. Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults. But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive. If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good. So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued and avoid potential conflicts with the community. Libraries are meant to provide information anyways. They have no need for things that are offensive, because rarely something that is offensive, provides information. Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people, not materials that could upset or corrupt young minds. In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age, should be taken out of libraries. Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think thats all that they should have, creating a safe and purely educational environment for every visitor.
556	3533	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to the public be removed? No, I strongly disagree. Should books that might be offensive to others be banned? No, because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more. All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them. For example, say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject so you decide to check it out. In the line behind you is a woman who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason. No, this would not be right just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone else loves and enjoys. Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves, like sexual content. Things such as sex might offend people because you might believe it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids but that's not the case. Most books on sex teach you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay safe. People need to understand that a significant percentage of teens worldwide are sexually active and books that can help you to protect yourself and others are valuable. In conclusion, there are many people that might or might not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has their opinion. You can't take things away just because of one person; that would not be fair to an individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on their personal problem. For these reasons I disagree with taking away items that might be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you.
557	3534	2	3	No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive. I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child to read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely. That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that topic and possibly gain something valuable out of it. There are some non-fiction books out there that can be marked as 'offensive', and they are just that—non-fiction. It is something that really happened and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained. I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it. I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins. I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand. To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another. If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left for our children to read and to learn from? They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence has hurt someone emotionally and physically, and that they should never do it in fear of the consequence that they might have to face later on. Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge. We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education. But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from?
558	3535	2	3	Censorship in libraries is an important thing in schools and in the public. It is important because some movies, books, and magazines have a bigger influence on kids than most people think. Like some of the really gory movies where there are always people in the movie getting cut up or shot. Do you really think that some kids don't think about that stuff? Sometimes the kids can get it in their head that they can do what they see or read. Like in the movie set in the southern United States where they are beating up and killing people just because they are colored. And some kids might think that that is okay. And they can go down to their library and just get it off the shelf and check it out and go home and watch it. Now if you are using it as a thing to teach kids that it was the way things used to be and that it is wrong then that is okay. You can teach your kids all you want just make sure that it is the right thing. And some magazines that are in the schools or in the public library are just not the kind of thing that kids should be looking at. Like the gun magazines or the hunting magazines they just show that it is okay to carry a gun wherever they go. And the hunting magazines just show that you can go out and shoot stuff. And some kids might be confused that you need a license to do all of that. You have to at least put an age limit on some stuff. It goes the same way with some of the books; they always start out good and then they just turn into a big mess of gore and violence. Like the story about the sphere; it started out with a group of people going under water to explore a ship. And they find a big sphere and they go in it and get these powers and they imagine it and it comes true. Well when a kid reads that they might think that they can do that and they start imagining that they can either hurt or really do some damage to someone. And then when they find out that it won't work they might do it to themselves. So it just goes to show that you should censor some of the stuff that you have in your libraries and if you can't take them out then at least put an age limit on them.
559	3536	2	3	Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries? No, I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them. If the person complains about a book, music, movies or anything then they should not go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be allowed in the library. When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awesome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal. When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians. He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave. I read the book and I thought there was nothing offensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free. It was a historical account, not an endorsement. My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People that do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book. That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.
560	3537	2	3	Censorship in Libraries Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' There are many books, magazines, and movies out there that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children might be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf. All people of a free society have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also. Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries may be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality. Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. There is content out there that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults might find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. There are many different types of books and music out there and censoring these would greatly limit the variety. In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what their child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent might not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. After all, you cannot shelter children from everything. Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the United States, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as individuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
561	3538	2	3	Censorship is it needed in todays societey? Where things that were considerd bad a few decades ago are considered acceptable today to be veiwed read listened to and so on. Is it a needed process or should libraries have free will to stock there shelves with what ever they seem fit to be there. Is it still a good process to use or is it a outdated uneeded resource that is now no longer needed. Everybody in todays soicitey says to read, but libraries often do not have the type of litature that your are in to, so why would you want to read somthing that you do not like because the library dos not have the book that you wanted to to see i. I believe that censorshop in libraries should be their to remove any book the find offenseive or immoral from there libary. I do not belive they should remove books becasue of bad language, or somthing about god. I think that books or magazines or movies with explicit content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit. Libraries should only feature books tht they want to have not ones that are popular but considerd 'bad' by the library. They should only have books they want to have. I do believe that their should be censorship in libarys. I just do not belive that it should be a harsh system. I think that they should set standards on what they want to have and following those standards on books they buy. I do think however that some libraries will set their standards to low or high that they wille ether have many books that are considerd 'bad', or no books at all. It is a very fine line when it comes to materials that the library has to be considerd good or bad. I think libraies should have a set of standards nation wide to set what type of material is good for libraries. I believe that censorship is still a needed, and helpful process. I just think that it is to much of a opionated process, with not enough facts or opions of the poeple. I think that is should remain in use for society i just belived it should be more under control then it is today, ensuring a balanced collection for all.
562	3539	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries. The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a Catholic school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population. Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to may not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person might enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others. In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, Fahrenheit 451, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain. As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people may never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves, preserving the freedom to choose.
563	3540	2	3	Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system. In the US people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class. In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us. Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writter, and it undermines our right to access information and form our own opinions.
564	3541	2	3	Do you think that books that have vulgar things in them should be on libaries shelfs? We all know that there are books out there are parents hope we never get a hold of. In this time try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it. It is nearly immposible to do that. Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled off the shelf. Have you seen the banned book list lately? I have and some of those books on there are ridciolus. Here are a few examples: The Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I could go on and on, the list is a mile long. Some of these books have historical meanings behind them. There is also morals behind them. I think that books should not be pulled from the self because they have a few bad words in them. It's not liuke we have never heard them words. In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn they have banned it from schyools because of the use of the word 'nigger'. This is not a nice word in our day and time. Back when we had slaves that is what they were called. It is points and views from an anti-slavery author. In Charlotte's Web it is banned because of animals talking. Come on really they have animals in movies that talk all the time. I belive that if kids don't no that animals cant really talk we might have problems. Do you find the show South Park offensive? Well it has been banned because it is racit against many groups. I would like to no how some of these people come up with this at. Whoever picks up this offensive matrial has a choice wheater or not they read it. It should be on the shelf even if it is offensive. I belive that it is totally up to you, if you read it. Just like if you go to a mvie store they have the movies rated. You dont want to watch rated R movies then dont rent it. They could use the same method with books. Do you still think offensive books should be pulled from shelfs? If you say yes, I would like to no why. It is your choice to read it. There are already all these other banned books out there why ban any more. Just because books have vulgar lanuage, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled from shelfs, as the decision to engage with the content ultimately rests with the individual reader.
565	3542	2	3	I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are ment to inlighten, inform, and entertain the reads. If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read, don't make the people who don't have a problem with what their reading or watching suffur. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do! There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the libaray won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet I was raised reading those book, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies, I was allowed to watch rated R movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's of for a child or adult, like G to rated R. The libaray has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated R without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater. Parent who are worried about their childrens well being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves, because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries bann 'The Da Vinci Code', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't ment to be offensive, but a fictional story of a mystery. I remember living in a town, with a lot of christin people, so the libraries only had christin books. When I went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population. I told them 'I have as much rights too have those books on the shelve, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of way they should have gotten them. The reason I think censorship is wrong, is because no one should be able to tell people what
566	3543	2	3	In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certain people, perhaps in a designated area for mature content. If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his or her age group I would not get mad, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others then some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would simply tell my son or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read together. Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certain age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelves to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group and its content was unsettling. So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again, ensuring a more secure environment for young readers.
567	3544	2	3	There are some movies, books, music, etc that may be found offensive toward some people. I feel that if you are at the appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it. If you read a book and you find it offensive, then you shouldn't have read the book; the responsibility lies with the individual's choice. Books, music, and movies are made to entertain you, however, if you are not entertained then what you're reading or watching is not for you! I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched. It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves. I was offended because as I watched the movie, and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother. I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way, also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either. After I watched the movie, I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me. I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader, however, there may be a way that they can restate things that they say. I know that people have their own opinion, and that people think differently. If it is obvious that the author's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that. If you find a book on the shelf, and you find it offensive, it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf. Another person may read the book, and they might like it. Everyone has their own way of thinking, and how they absorb information. It may be offensive to the reader, but someone else may receive the book and admire it. In conclusion, I feel that if you are offended by a certain book, type of music, or movie you should learn from the experience, and explain why it offended you. If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well. It will have a negative effect on your child. Books, music, movie, etc are made to entertain, not to offend, and that fundamental purpose should guide our individual responses to media.
568	3545	2	3	I believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many. But I think that I have a pretty good outlook, and a pretty good view on this. In this essay I'm going to give you my reasoning, and explain, and give some reasons why I think censorship is a good thing, and should maybe be enforced heavier. Censorship. Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be taken off the shelf? I believe that it is a complex issue, and everyone should have their right to read what they want to, and what they don't. I believe, that if someone wants to read something vulgar, then let them. If they are an adult, it's their choice. I think as far as the child part of it, that no, children should not be allowed to read things that may be vulgar, sexual, etc. In keeping children away from these vulgar things, they should have, or keep separate sections for kids, and adults. I don't think that children should be able to have the access, and maybe they won't know about it, or want it. If their parents think it's okay, and want to let them read it, or watch it, or listen to it, that before they become an adult they will have to get it for them. I don't believe that children should be candy coated, and blind to the world, I just believe that there is a certain extent to what they need to be limited to. I obviously think that censorship is a good thing. I think if there was more of it, I think there would be less crime. Kids are learning this, they're watching as young as god knows what, thinking it's okay from the start, and are growing up with that picture, and message, of them thinking it's okay. No I am not saying that all kids learn everything from t.v., etc., and yes some may argue that kids don't copy what's on t.v. at all. But I think that t.v., books, and music affect a lot of how children view the world. As much as I love rap music, and movies such as A.T.L, rappers such as various artists, even sometimes when I watch, or listen to those things, it kind of makes me feel like being jaded, and kind of makes me feel like I want to have a bad attitude towards the world, it makes me feel like I wanna live that hard life like that. I think that music, books, what we watch on t.v., and what we read in the magazines, have a big affect. Such as if we watch the news and there's something depressing, it kind of makes you in a bad mood, or sad or depressed. The media, music, t.v., books, magazines, etc., affect our mood, our actions, and even sometimes the way we talk, and dress. I am not saying that dressing that more urban feel is a bad thing, I am just saying when you start doing crime, and drugs because of it, it's a problem. I believe that children should only be censored and not adults, because at the point when u reach adult-hood, your pretty much set in your way's, and have a pretty good look out on what you should be doing, and how you want thing's done. Children are still maturing, and are like a sponge. Censorship, is a very sensitive, and argumentable/debatable issue, but this is just my view, what's yours?
569	3546	2	3	To whom it may concern; As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that may be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves. As American citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities. This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that may be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as citizens, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want. Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in bookstores and libraries, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as PG or G are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they may only see PG rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it! Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove any books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in the country alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away our personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way. Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions.
570	3547	2	3	To whom it may concern, I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves of a library if they are found offensive. Some books may seem offensive to some people but to others their perspective is a lot different. I believe that if books or other things are found offensive they should have a special place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them without them being in plain sight. Books are very valuable to most people in the united states. Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is it really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write? Just because one person reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call it offensive. I have a feeling that a lot more people would feel the same way about preserving access. Along with movies, and etc. I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, adult sections, and even a teenage section. I feel like parents now in days don't want their children to learn about stuff early in life. But I still feel like if they did not want there kids reading it then don't let them; it is a matter of parental guidance. If there ever was a need to really look at something and give it another chance this would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offensive? Sure it might take a little bit more work but hey, someone has to do it. As you can see these are really good reasons why they should not remove stuff that other people find offensive from libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographies. People really do enjoy a lot of these books and even movies, or magazines. It would be really great if this could happen, it would make a lot of people happy and satisfied with their library's collection.
571	3548	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make a lot of people happier. The wants and needs of people vary from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another may hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want. Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has positive influences. That's life though and not everyone has the same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well. Opinions will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond and we must learn to coexist with diverse materials.
572	3549	2	3	Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure. These books have many different styles and portrayals and many of these may be taken as offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf. One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them racially offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legal and slaves were treated as property not people. A movie that many people have seen recently is Slumdog Millionaire. This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'. Many Indians who are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart. But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real. But if you go to some people and ask them about these books or movies some will say they are really good others might be offended so they might as well stay on the shelves. The book 'The Killer Angels' is a book about the civil war could this be seen as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelves. So books in libraries shouldn't be censored because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every book other than some childrens books have something offensive. Thus if we took books off the shelves for being offensive there would be nothing to read except for 'The Cat in the Hat'!
573	3550	2	3	Would you ever read a book about the Holocaust times if you are Jewish? Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured? Probably not. If you are a colored man/woman, are you going to engage in a book that talks about slavery? Not likely. How about if you are a mother, are you going to want to read a novel or magazine about abortion? Are you going to let your child read that book? Of course not! So you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves, right? Its on the shelves for basically one reason, to drown us in the knowledge it holds. Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there is always going to be one person who is against it all. When we read, we find books that are to our own enjoyment, we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads. Most of us however, don't quite understand why others refuse to read such a book or even hold in their hands a book that is different from all their beliefs. Beliefs are important to people no matter their age, gender, sexuality, or their race. Its just a way of life. Some stories are there for our entertainment, some catch our emotions, and some are there for our knowledge. When authors write, they usually think of events that have happened or what they predict could happen in the future. Authors try to get you to understand the world around you, not by trying to offend you in any way. Books tend to affect people in many ways, positive and yes, sometimes negative. Its something they can't really control though, so you can't really blame anyone for you being offended. I don't agree that libraries shouldn't have these books on their shelves, I think they are good for us. No, I don't mean we should go around eating books. We should take time to read some of those so called offensive books. You are probably thinking, there is no way I'm going to pick up that type of book and sit down and read it. However, let me tell you that if we read these books, the more people will understand about how terrible times were back then and how some things are still bad. Take abortion into perspective. Books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is or how it can not only effect the women who go through with it. It appeals to the emotions of others in a way that makes them think twice about lifes decisions. Books should be kept on the shelves for our own well-being. When it comes down to the choice, you will know just what to do. You know how useful books are in helping us see the difference between right and wrong. You understand why books are placed on shelves for in the first place, no its not for the money. I know that you are going to understand what I'm trying to tell you. Now head on over to your library and pick up a book about something you would like to know more about. Who knows, maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings and gain a new perspective on the world.
574	3551	2	3	In my opinion, I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people, it oversteps its bounds. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not censor everything are because of the fact that not everyone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is compromised if the choices we have are limited. When someone gets offended by the media that is out there, that does not necessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censored because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic. Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to have censorship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. When children are growing up and are taught the values that they know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means is if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then there would not be any books left. I believe in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well. Individuality is when one person has different traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the music we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to think that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them different because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases. Also from experience I have learned that a book that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understanding, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that may not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, may be seen as a good thing to another and deserve their place on the library shelf.
575	3552	2	3	Take it or leave it? How do you take it when people come out with magazines, movies, or music that is extremely offensive to you? How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things? The truth is we can not stop them, there is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that you can get it anywhere. It is all over the internet and you can't control that. If I find something very offensive in a store or online I should have the right to voice my opinion, and that opinion should be taken seriously. They shouldn't have inappropriate things in public stores or places children can go. That is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids. Some people should just know better and take it or leave it. Almost every day that I go online, I see something on the side of the website advertising some kind of pornography site. Its unbelievable how that is allowed on public websites for everyone to see. If they're going to continue to do this, there needs to be some law saying they can not on public sites. I see things of half naked ladies on the side of the website and I know thats not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages. I understand a lot of things in this world is about money and people make money by selling things to others. Selling movies, magazines, and music saying or doing things that are rebellious is easy money for older teens and older people. They can still make good money if they were to make funny stuff instead of pornography things, everyone loves to watch, read, or listening to something funny. So basically we aren't going to stop this completely and you all should know that. The best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day. It should die down eventually. We can only hope for the best and work towards a more considerate public space.
576	3553	2	3	Libraries have always housed interesting materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, and there always will be. They remain one of the best places to find those diverse materials. I do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves simply because some people find them objectionable. After all, libraries want people to be interested in reading their books. If some individuals find different books offensive, then they shouldn't go near those specific books. If they have a complaint, then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out. Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material off their shelves because some people don't like them; it is your personal choice to read a book, and nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Now, if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could internally decide whether they want to act or not, but they still don't need to be told what to do by outsiders. It is their business and they ultimately decide what materials stay and which ones go. If I was one of those who took offense to a book in the library, then I would just keep it to myself. I wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just because of one book. It is important to think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and to consider what their interests are. That is less trouble you will have to go through later on in life, fostering a more tolerant community for everyone.
577	3554	2	3	They should not be removed from the shelves. If someone finds a particular item offensive, they don't have to look at it or check it out from the library. A simple solution is that if someone finds it offensive then they can politely ask a librarian for that material to be put on the highest shelf there. They always have a choice on whether they can access it or not. Many materials found in a library, even if they are offensive to some, can be incredibly helpful for someone else's research or education. The material could contain or show some much needed information that is not readily available elsewhere. The people who find it offensive have the full right to not look at it and to avoid it. Just because there is some kind of material they find offensive does not mean that everyone else does too. The people do not need to look at something that they find personally offensive. If there is something offensive about a particular item, just ask a librarian if they can place that book or movie up higher on the shelves where it is less conspicuous. If they find something offensive about the material then they can just not look at it; simply don't check it out if you find it offensive. If they need it out of sight, you can always put it on the highest shelf as a compromise. There are a lot of materials in libraries that some may find offensive. Even though they are found offensive to someone, someone else could use that very material for an important paper or a school project. Getting rid of a material can cause someone to lose vital information about whatever they are researching. Books are often the easiest way to get reliable information, but not when you are getting rid of them arbitrarily. The reason why material from libraries should not be taken away is that children can still find that stuff on the internet, which is far less controlled. If you get rid of those materials, you should probably get rid of your internet too for consistency. No matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff, there is always a way for them to see it elsewhere. So the offensive material should not be taken off shelves in the library because they are needed for legitimate purposes and children will find out about the offensive stuff whenever they want to through other means.
578	3555	2	3	If you saw a book on the shelf of your library that took offense to you in some way or another, how would you react? Would you simply pass the book by and go on searching for another, or would you be so taken by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately? Every school, public library, movie theatre, magazine stand, and any form of media in this world will do or say one thing or another that someone is not going to like. It could be in a magazine in the do and don'ts section and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list, or it could be something about a specific race. Everyone, one time in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other peoples words and publishings in the world, but I do not think that is ever going to stop completely. All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposes. These things out there in the world are not for one specific group of people; they are for everyone. Every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person. Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is hot right now doesn't mean that they should take it out of their magazines for all of their viewers. To me, that is just ridiculous. So, say you stumbled across a book about the Ku Klux Klan in the library and you are a person from negro descent. Would you get offended? Or, say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago, would that anger you? If I were a person of negro descent it wouldn't make me mad at all, because it is just history, history that happened a long time ago that does not pertain directly to me. We could not toss those books out anyways because without those history books at school we couldn't learn about our collective past. History is important to everyone and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out, how would we prevent history from repeating itself? When I was a young child my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to deal with abuse. I tried to have my mother watch a movie with me called 'Mommie Dearest'. The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies and she finally gets out of it and betters her and her childrens lives. My mom said that she couldn't watch it with me because, 'it hit too close to home.' Everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media. The media does not look at you as a whole, just as a population of people. When one person doesn't like something it doesn't mean it should be taken out or erased from history; it should just be rewritten or refilmed if it contains factual inaccuracies, but not simply removed. You cannot control what everyone else says or does in books or movies; you have to just be in control of how you look upon it and your own reactions. That is what I choose to do and I would say it is working out great for my own peace of mind.
579	3556	2	3	No, libraries should not remove materials because people like different books, movies, music, and magazines. A diverse collection is essential. If people start removing items they dislike, then patrons won't come back to that particular library. They will go some where else to get the movie or whatever it is they are seeking. This would harm the library's role in the community. Some people want certain items to be removed but some don't want them to be removed, creating a conflict where the majority should not be dictated to by a vocal minority. The key is personal responsibility, especially for parents. If you don't want your kids to read them, listen to them, or watch them, then don't let them get them; it is a parent's duty to guide their children's choices, not the library's role to limit the available options for everyone. In the end, a library must serve its entire community with a wide array of materials to choose from.
580	3557	2	3	What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship that it stifles access. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest, which requires a broad selection. Certain materials are too strong to be put in public libraries, particularly those with explicitly adult content. There are specialty stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase privately. Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials as a matter of public protection. Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content but are not entirely unacceptable. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries at all. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure and intellectual engagement. Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away for everyone. If that was how things worked, there would be almost nothing left in the library for people to enjoy, as tastes vary so widely. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their individual opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their community library. I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries, from various genres and perspectives. Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials. It all depends on the persons own interests and choices at any given time. Sometimes I will be disappointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment or important insight. In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries to filter out the most extreme content, but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them and expand their horizons. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions or a small group's sensitivities.
581	3558	2	3	Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? Well this is what I'm going to talk about in my essay. I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it doesn't mean that another person won't find it valuable or enjoyable. Also, some books that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequences that could happen or it could reinforce your understanding about those kind of serious topics. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them have that opportunity.  Sometimes I will go to the library to find a book that I saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so I would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must have something in it that could be offensive to others. But I know that a lot of people like those so-called nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinions about things, so just because the person that is allowed to take the books off the shelf or put them on doesn't like the book or thinks its not appropriate doesn't mean that someone else will not like it either. That person's personal taste should not dictate the choices available to the entire community.  Well, here is what I think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taken off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it. The principle of individual choice is paramount, and removing materials limits that freedom for everyone.
582	3559	2	3	Well today I am going to talk to you about censorship in books, music, movies, and magazines in your libraries, because some of them can be pretty graphic on some of the things they talk about or do in a story. But yes some of them can be more graphic than others, but that doesn't mean you have to take them off the shelf. Not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff. But some people like to read about murders and gangs selling drugs and that's fine. It's like this everyone has their own taste on what they like. It can be a novel, a sports biography, a true crime story, just a true story that has happened to someone, and etc. That's just the part of the world. How would it be if everyone liked the same things? Pretty boring right, yeah definitely. So therefore I don't think books should be taken off the shelves. It could be the next best story for somebody. You never know.  Now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to. All they talk about is sex, drugs, alcohol, and etc. But that doesn't give you the right to take them off the shelf; that's what some people like to listen to. But there is some music out there that doesn't just talk about that. There is the oldies, country, jazz, hip hop, and etc. But for the most part all music is good; it's just some of them are better than others. Let's take country for instance; it talks about some sex, and some alcohol but that's not the whole song; they mainly talk about country boys and the things they do or have happened to them over time, and they are pretty much right. So all music is good, but without music I don't think the world would be a very nice place. People listen to music all the time: when working out, at work, driving, or just sitting at home. So there are some good music and bad music; you make the call.  But with movies there are some movies made just for that reason; it's all called entertainment for adults. Which yes is kinda pointless, but it's there and probably won't ever leave. There are movies made for sex, drugs, and alcohol. That's just the part of life; everything is not perfect. So in that matter you got to tell your children about this stuff and stop them from watching it at a young age. Because I think it is taking a big role in teen pregnancy, because if they see it and think it looks fun they might try it, and sexual content is so easy to get. It's all over the web and etc. It's like drugs; they are so easy to get. There are meth labs all over for meth and there is weed all around. You just got to tell your kids what they can watch and can't. Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network are all great shows for kids. So parents be the boss about that stuff.  Now we get to magazines. There are millions of magazines all around the world; they are one thing that will never leave this world. They carry news, entertainment, comics, or tips on how to do something. That's what is going to be in this world till the world ends. But yes take with caution; there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at until they are adults. But that doesn't make them bad; people enjoy looking at them kinds of magazines; that's just what people like. It's not like you're going to stop your son from looking at a Playboy or your daughter from looking at teen gossip magazines forever; it's all a part of life. But you can stop it from happening at a young age. You just got to get it clear to your child to not look at this stuff until you're older. But you can't stop everything. All I am trying to say is yes there is some bad things out there and there is a lot of good things too, but that doesn't give you the right to remove them from the library shelves.
583	3560	2	3	Do I think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries? No, books should not be taken out of libraries. If students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world. Teens do talk about their lives so pretty much students at Central High and North High students are going to hear about mature topics regardless. If the parents are sending their child to school and they don't want them to hear about it then don't send them to school! In school they will hear verbal arguments and see physical fights. If the parents don't want them to hear about it from other kids then they should tell them, they should explain it to them themselves. One way or another they will find out. It can come from the parents, their friends, teachers, anybody. Teens do not care if your child is watching when they are fighting; they are not worried about that at that time.  The saying 'one person ruins it all for everybody,' well that's because some teens need to grow up and act their age. If you can't act your age then you shouldn't be in the grade you are in. Kids and teens need to grow up; if they can't read a book without being immature about it then don't read it. If their parents let them watch movies that they think they are old enough to watch then don't take advantage of that privilege.  Taking books out of the libraries will not change anything. Kids will still fight and rough house. Yeah some books are a little outrageous, but not all books are like that. To be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in. High schoolers should be able to control themselves when reading about sex, drugs, or drinking. If they are not responsible enough to read that then they shouldn't get that book anyway. Songs made today can get a little out of hand. If your child listens to that kind of music with all the bad words, talking about sex, drugs, alcohol, then parents all you got to do is take those songs away from them personally. Teens that are mature shouldn't get punished just because immature kids can't watch a movie, listen to a song, read a book or a magazine without causing a problem. It's not fair to those responsible people. People that act their age should be able to read, watch the movie, or anything just because they can handle the situation better. So don't punish everybody just because of some immature kids that ruin it for everybody by demanding censorship.
584	3561	2	3	I'm writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way. What one person might not like, the next person might love and find deeply meaningful. The only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is if there are many consistent complaints about the same specific material. Then maybe the library should consider reviewing and potentially removing the item. That's why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch before they check it out. It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, since there are many other things to choose from in a library's vast collection. How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because another person didn't like it? They would be upset and disappointed about the situation, feeling their access to culture was unfairly limited.  In conclusion, I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offensive. I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts on the importance of maintaining a diverse and accessible collection for all patrons.
585	3562	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First, I know that people have different views upon things such as magazines, books, and music. And I also know that there are somethings that may be offensive to you, but they aren't offensive to other people. Such as music; there are all kinds of music out there. And I know that some people find rap music offensive and some don't. Because a lot of people that don't find it offensive relates to the stories and experiences within the lyrics.  Second, I feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem for the wider community. Because I know that maybe there is a type of magazine, book, or even a type of music that they listen to that is offensive to someone else; they might not find it offensive but I bet someone else finds it offensive. So for them to judge these things wouldn't be right when their own preferences might offend others.  Third, I'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive or widely condemned, the library wouldn't have it in the first place based on their own selection policies. But maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better and more tolerant place. And yes I understand that people have different views but we shouldn't let that get to us and dictate what others can access.  So you can see, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Because there are billions of people on this earth and I doubt they would all give you the same answer on what is acceptable. So many people have different opinions, and beliefs upon things, and a public library should reflect that diversity rather than suppress it.
586	3563	2	3	According to Katherine Paterson, who wrote an article about censorship in the library, we must consider a fundamental question: should we have the right to take a book, magazine, movie, etc., off the shelf freely, whether we are offended by it or not? I believe we should not have that right to pull things off shelves freely. If we had that right, it would cause problems from many standpoints if you think about it carefully.  One significant problem it could cause involves people's personal thoughts towards a book, movie, CD, and so forth. If one person looks at a piece of media and decides, 'I don't like this and this about it,' and then just pulls it off the shelf, that is one less thing for somebody who does like it. Just because that person dislikes what the material offers to the public does not mean somebody else will feel the same. Nobody in this entire world is exactly the same; everybody has their own unique likes and dislikes. If everyone had the freedom to remove things they disliked, then there would eventually be nothing left for anybody to read, listen to, watch, or enjoy.  You also have to think about how that would affect the business of stores, libraries, and other establishments. If everybody is pulling everything off the shelves, what would there be left to sell or read? If a business is not making any money from its inventory, then it will likely have to be closed down. Especially in today's economy, no business wants to run low on money or face financial ruin due to such arbitrary actions.  In Katherine's article, at the end, she said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That statement is basically reiterating what I said earlier about people's differing likes and dislikes concerning everything. If you don't want your kids or anybody else's kids looking at something you believe is offensive, you should take it up with one of the workers so they can consider moving it to a different section, like a section reserved for older kids and people. This is a more responsible approach.  It mainly falls on parents to decide what content they want their kids looking at. You are the ones to raise them the way you see fit. If you think they are too young for something, then that is when you tell them no or guide them accordingly. We should not have the right to take anything off of a shelf ourselves. Books, movies, music, and etc. are for entertainment and enrichment. If something does not entertain you, that does not mean it will not entertain or enrich somebody else. This principle is essential for a diverse and functioning society.
587	3564	2	3	There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compassion. But, other books can have mean or hateful effects on the person who is reading them. Censorship, which involves taking books, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing in many circumstances.  In many cases, censorship is a great thing because it protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young and impressionable age. In libraries, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things a book might be saying, thereby safeguarding their innocence.  Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could easily get stuck in a young person's head. This might cause an effect on that child, and they might start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing, which could be a negative influence.  Movies should also be censored appropriately. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barely had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of frightening material when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many nightmares from the movies or books that she consumed, which shows the potential harm.  Now since I am older, my parents are starting to let me watch and read more mature things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personally been offended by some books. Although censored books might have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs and values.  Thousands of books are censored each year for these very reasons. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people have strong and differing opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the innocent minds of young children from content that is not suitable for their development and understanding. This protective role is a vital function of responsible institutions.
588	3565	2	3	Different people have different types of genres of books, music, movies, etc., that they like as well as those they don't like. Meaning that it is up to you what you like, and you are never forced to read or listen to anything you do not want to. Books, music, and other entertaining things are here as an option, so if you do not like something, then you do not have to deal with it; you can simply choose something else.  I feel that it is completely unnecessary that books should be removed from the shelves just because someone has gotten offended by its content. You were never told that it is a must to read that specific book, and it was not the company's nor the author's fault that you rented the book and felt insulted. Most likely, there was no one directing the story towards you personally, so why get all worked up over something that has happened to you and take it out on the media? You chose it of your own free will. Why make the company lose investment over something that could be easily taken care of by simply taking the item back to where you got it from?  I have read many books, listened to many songs, and seen lots of movies that were not in my best interest or to my taste, but I did not make them stop selling them because I am pretty sure someone out there likes it. Why stop someone else's enjoyment because of my personal disinterest or dislike? It is really not that necessary. And that is a problem in the world today; people take little situations and turn them into a big catastrophe for no good reason. If you do not like something, then do not get it. People need to put their feet in the company's shoes and realize that if it was their product, they would understand the frustration.  Books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are made for everyone in the world to provide entertainment for those who are interested. Taking them off the shelves would be more than unnecessary just because one person does not like the content. People have different opinions about life, and that is what makes every individual different from one another. So why ruin other people's fun just to get what you want? It is a selfish act that disregards the diversity of public taste.  As I stated before, it is not necessary to remove an item from the shelves because someone has taken offense to something within it. It is not the company's fault for providing a variety of choices, so just simply do not buy it or take it back if you are dissatisfied. Things would be so much better if everyone followed this simple principle. Get the items that best fit you and leave the others that do not on the shelves for those who will appreciate them. This is the fairest approach for everyone involved.
589	3566	2	3	Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the library? Well, in my point of view, I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are amazing, exciting, and fun to read or watch, and they should not be removed from the shelves in the local library. For a fact, people in general have many types of tastes in books; there is drama, romance, action, and many other genres that also apply to movies, magazines, and etc. The public should not be punished for one person's interest in certain themes or how they interpret a book. There should be an age limit which prevents kids from reading certain books, and those of age should be allowed to read whatever they please.  I, myself, like to read scary books; they give me chills and all types of questions run through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same train of thought I have when reading a scary book and find the same thrill. Without books that fit our personality and interests, there would be fewer people in libraries reading, and more people trying to keep themselves occupied, and half of them might even get bored and start committing crimes just to keep themselves occupied. People in the community have the right to read, hear, or watch whichever type of material they like and find engaging.  If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because a book is about 'violence' or they simply do not like the theme; they should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other materials were meant for us to enjoy them, and they represent the authors' or directors' choice to share their stories with the world. Without books like those, many people cannot get ideas to help them create their own book or novel, stifling creativity.  So that is my view on the situation; people should be free to enjoy whatever material they like without fear of it being removed. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazines should be removed, I suggest you take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local library, and see how the experience might change your mind and broaden your perspective on the value of diverse media.
590	3567	2	3	There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made-up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library, though, that could be considered offensive by certain individuals. But should those materials be removed from the library entirely? Some think that they should, and others think that they should not be removed.  In my opinion, I do not think that things should be removed from a library outright. Certain people might find things offensive, and others might think it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in a library to help manage access appropriately.  I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People do not want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult, as that could teach kids bad things that they do not need to be reading about at a young age. I think that there should be an area set aside for kids that are in elementary to high school, and there should be a separate section that is specifically for adults. That way, kids are not accidentally reading things that are meant for a more mature audience.  I also think that there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about to guide patrons. For example, if there are books on sensitive topics like slavery, they should have a designated area for books about that subject so that people who are offended by it know to stay away from that section. The same principle could apply to magazines. I do not think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people might enjoy reading them and find value in them.  Some reading material might be found offensive to certain people, but to others, it might not be offensive at all. I think things should not be removed from libraries simply because of individual complaints. There are some things that people might need to have in a library if they are doing a research project or school assignment, so that they have the necessary resources to do it properly and learn from a variety of sources.  I do think, however, that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are allowed in the store or library area. Kids do not need to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school; that just is not right. Especially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be exposed to or doing, it is better to restrict access.  So, in my opinion, there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing are candidates for removal or restricted access, while magazines and other reading materials should be kept away in areas where only adults can get to them, ensuring a balanced and responsible environment for all patrons.
591	3568	2	3	I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid and imposing their personal views on everyone else. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.' First of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They might find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict and a cycle of control. Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults. Censorship is the same thing that dictators did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in a free society. The citizens of this country have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great and censorship directly undermines that foundational principle.
592	3569	2	3	Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them properly. Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet. Adults do not need censorship. There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read. Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections, children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear. Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion and ultimately a personal decision.
593	3570	2	3	Each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library. Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide. Every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting. There will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious. Designed with distinctly different minds, people want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors. People should maintain a right to choose which books he or she wants to read. Never, will one book bind the world. Minds of human beings are too complexly separated. For example; reading 'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald in my English class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class. Books of racism, religion, and sexual content intrigue a person's mind, or otherwise disgust one's. Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done. There will always be that one person who declines to agree. It is a choice. It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read. If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom? Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the Christian faith will not be stood for by the reader. Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point. To others, however, it draws them further and further away from the story. A choice should remain a person's right; especially to read a book written to be read. Finding an appropriate book is not the problem. That has yet to become the problem. The only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling. I find 'Lolita in the Rye' to be dangerously inappropriate. However, it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions. Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content. Do I find it offensive to some? No, but I understand where others could find it offensive. There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it is not offensive to every person who reads it. To reiterate, the mind of human is a unique one, that identifies with no other. To sum up the full idea of this position; every person should be given the choice to read what he or she desires. Give each person the choice, and the rebellion will settle down. Removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it; sometimes completely rebelliously. Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf everytime someone wants one banned will not leave books for anyone. As a person, I am well associated with my mind, and it desires the freedom of choice. Every human mind desires the freedom to choose. Give people the choice. Remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they might be interested in. Let readers have their freedom and the right to choose for themselves.
594	3571	2	3	In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, might offend other. In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people. We are blessed to live in a free country, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people? I do not think that is right or fair to the author or other readers. 'One man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book might not mean something to one person but it might mean the word to someone else. You never know what people might need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book might offend a few people, but it might save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life. Take Anne Frank for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this might offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like Jewish people, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your ten year old to hear about how they use to treat Jewish women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told. I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book that better suits your personal tastes and sensibilities.
595	3572	2	3	I think alot of books are good to read cause some of them will tell you more wat u didnt know so thierfore u might pick up a book that u like and read it andyou might like it but doesnt have more meaning to what your reading alot of books you read have some type of character in it that might talk about another thing thats opposite then what the other charcter is talking about magazines show you sometimes wat the persons life style is like some books that people read has no action or felling in it so they can just pick up and read the book its always good to pick up a reasonable book so someone can read books thats positive and would mean something to other people to read the same book you read i think the best book is one that tells you about life and what you need to know to suceed life you might run in to a book that is true and get into it so you can learn sometimes about what you read and write about it on a essay paper a magazine and movie book shows alot of action and wat its like what they do most people migh think its boring to read a unaction book so they get a book that they have action to so it might exsite them more than a regular book but most books have more pictures than words in it you should take a book off the shelf that has wat you need to know about cause action books might not help you all the time the more action fun books you read are not as good as wat another book is taking place at in a stor because they often lack the deeper meaning and life lessons that can truly help a person grow and understand the world around them.
596	3573	2	3	In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes. Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it. Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left. Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed that they simply found challenging or inconvenient. Removing items from shelves removes history. Our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination. If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again. Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out. If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it. Something that you take as offensive might be something that inspires and encourages someone else. Wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone. Think about it. If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion? You have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want. It should not be limited based on someone elses opinion. It would cause much argument among people. Some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence over whose viewpoint prevails. There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them. If items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left. People read for enjoyment and knowledge. They deserve to have a wide selction to choose from. In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes. Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something. If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it. There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation. We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through. We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them. Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it, as this principle is fundamental to a free and educated society.
597	3574	2	3	The United States is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the 1700's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In America we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of America and it's Constitution. Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know what or what not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination and a lack of critical understanding. I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents might find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary. I personally learned a lot of things from what I've seen on television. Whats on television might be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know what to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before. If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then America is not practicing what it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom and self-determination.
598	3575	2	3	Censorhship should play a major part in which books should enter and leave the library. Thats why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or cd should deffinitly should be removed from the shelf if it is found offensive to atleast ten children. Now it would be asking too much to have the libraian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about. So therefore a library should have a certain section that if a libraian thinks that there might be some bad language or refrence to drugs or alcohol then that book should go into that part of the library. I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I dont think a little kid should be reading but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the libraian. Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for. Just because the movie has a title that dont seem that bad dont mean that there wont be any grapic images in that movie, or that there wont be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie. Now since movies are alot easier to review and since they also have a rating then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not. But there should deffinitly be a part in the library that if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room. Music would be another thing you would deffinitly have to watch out for because with each song could change how the languge is in that cd. So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and persoanlly listen to that cd before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to. But personally i think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new cd album that an artist makes he could easily change how his wording is in the songs. So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music. One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words. Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, cd's, or movies catagorized by age. As a child gets older he will be tought more about certain things. Then once he picks up that book and sees that its mentioned in the book it wont be that big of a shock to him or his parents. With the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence. So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence then there would be nothing left on the shelfs for kids to listen to or read. Your not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or cd that has something to do with violence or alcohol use. But you can take some of the stuff that has alot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf. By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that might seem inappropriate for children will deffinitly make a big difference and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a cd and hears the artist metion something about that. Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violene. So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf there would be no games left for kids to play. So there are just some things that contain violence that you just cant keep your child from seeing at one point in time. All the games have a rating on them so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game. By doing that you will be able to somewhat controll what your child will see and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available. So I have pretty much covered about how who ever is in charge of the games, books, movies and cds should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf. You dont have to censor everything but there are deffinitly some things out there that should not be put out on the shelfs for little kids to look at or listen to. And if a little kid wants to get a game a parent should have to look at the game and the rating of the game to determine if that child is mature enough to handle what goes on in that game. But overall I personally dont think that they should just go through and ban everything from going on the shelfs it should be up to the child to determine if they can handle what that movie or book contains, with proper guidance from their parents.
599	3576	2	3	Do I believe that some books should be taking off the shelves if they are found offensive ? Well what do you think ? I think they should depending on cause or what degeree of the party being offended. I feel if there are books ,movies,or music that are saying or showing a form of insluts then it depends on who is being offended. If you have a racist book against all races like blacks,asian,or mexican etc... other minorities might find out about those forms of insults and they raise an issue about it, then yes take it off the shelves. If you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent and lead to public disturbances. Also, if you dont then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library and you would loose business and community trust. So to avoid all of the fighting and lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorites. If they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well. Plus, they only come here for an oppurtunity to start a new life cause usually they're coming from poverty srticken towns, homes countries. I myself, am not a racist person I think that we are equal just unique individuals we're all unique in our own ways that is what makes us who we are today, and libraries should reflect that spirit of equality and respect.
600	3577	2	3	Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people might believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others might disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away. If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who might enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy, and our cultural landscape would become barren. For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed. I am also aware that people might just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored through existing tools. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's may require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game. We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who do like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them and access the media that reflects our diverse interests.
601	3578	2	3	Today in society there are many things people have different views on. They can be based on religion, race, or how one was brought up in a different way. Today in libraries there are many books of all types. They can relate to all different kinds of people and their diverse perspectives. If one book is discriminating against another individual, is this right? I think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons. First off, no one is the same; what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person. If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music, they don't have to read, watch, or listen to it. Since no one is the same, what someone might not find appealing can be an amazing thing to another person. Second, this material can be there for a purpose. The nation wasn't always an equal place. If there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races, I think it's simply showing history. If we didn't have history to look back on, we wouldn't be able to see how the country has progressed, from slave states to all free states. I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can be looked back upon. The third reason is that a library is supposed to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music, and more. If we were to take everything out of the libraries that comes off as offensive, it wouldn't be a place where you could find things that you wanted. It would probably be a boring place with little value. If there's no variety in a library, I don't see how it can be called a library. You can find whatever you're looking for in a library, whether it's a book on how to do hair or the history of the United States. In conclusion, these reasons make up why libraries should stay the way they are. One is because what might be offensive to an individual might be different to someone else. Second, it would take a lot away from our historical record. Third, it wouldn't make a library what it is today. These are legitimate reasons why it should be left alone.
602	3579	2	3	In our public libraries we can find books that are related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution and violence. These books all have history in them of our past. We cannot, as a society, forget our past because as many historians say, history repeats itself. If we start censoring our libraries then all that history will be forgotten, and/or lost forever. Libraries can help us in many different ways. They help us with school projects, business projects, and libraries better our knowledge as a person. You cannot go censoring the libraries just because someone finds a book offensive. The stories of slavery are still taken offensively among people today, but if we start taking stories about people who have been enslaved and hide them from the people, we will slip back into that terrible past. There are gang stories of terrifying people, such as Al Capone. He killed many people, destroyed many shops and probably even sold a lot of drugs. We need history to show our weakness as a nation and not hide because of this weakness but thrive on it to better our cities, better our police training, and most importantly, better the next generation of kids to be raised better. There is more than just books at the public library; there are movies and documentaries of our nation and the world. Movies that talk about World War I and World War II. These types of movies can show how horrifying war really is and how cruel people can get. During World War II, there was the Holocaust where six million Jews lost their lives because one person, Adolf Hitler, did not like them. People made movies like those to show the world how devastating man can be, but people have also made movies on amazing discoveries and amazing places. For example, the discovery of the Titanic. One of the greatest findings among the world. Music can also be a good way to better one's self. If you play an instrument and you need music to play to, why not go to the library to get some? You don't have to worry about paying for a twenty-dollar CD and you can use it until you're done with it then return it. Then with how advanced our technology is, people can get CDs to burn onto a computer and put on their iPod or MP3 player. Plus the library is a good place to just go look for music you like. So, should there be censorship in our libraries? No! There should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history. History of our country, history of our world, and history of sad and hard times. Instead of censoring our youth of today from history we need to set age limits. Young people of a certain age cannot read certain books unless they are with a parent or guardian. That is one simple way to keep our kids from reading overly mature things but still able to get the history he or she needs because as historians always say, history repeats itself and as a growing nation, we need to better ourselves in every way possible. The answer to that is through our history.
603	3580	2	3	I don't think books that would offend people should be on the shelf. Some of the books that maybe on the shelf this month could hurt someone's feelings. But I also think people should be able to read what they want to read. Many people wouldn't read a book that they think would offend them in the first place. There are many kinds of books; not all books will be bad or offend people. But books that are not appropriate for young kids or teens shouldn't even be in school libraries. In public libraries I think it should be okay to have every type of book, and have different books in different places, like having the young adult section and the adult and children sections. I think certain books should be sold in book stores; I don't think they should have inappropriate books in children's book stores. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what their children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying. There are lots of parents that don't really care about what their kids read, and to me that's their business, but my opinion is that they shouldn't let their kids read whatever they want. Parents should be with the child when he or she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen today and older, I think they would be old enough to choose what they want to read. By the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easier and make their own decisions.
604	3581	2	3	Hi, I'm Henry and I agree that if there are books in a school library or a public library that are offensive they should be removed. I'm a type of person who believes that offensive books shouldn't be in libraries because I hate seeing people upset or mad because they read a book that offended them. That includes magazines and movies and even music. I, Henry, have read a few books that has offended myself or has made fun of black people and I have black friends. If I could have it my way I would have all books like that out of school libraries and public libraries. And I say that because little kids don't need to be reading that kind of stuff and neither do we. That's just like music now days; you turn on a radio station and people are cussing and making fun of other colored people. Also you can't understand what they're saying half the time. They need to put on music that you can understand that doesn't have cussing in it and that you can understand because some kids like to listen to music. Magazines, I look at a lot of magazines myself but they're all like coonhunting magazines or four-wheeler ones looking for tires or something like that. But yes, also the bad magazines need to go too so that way little kids aren't looking at them. Also it might help some crime to stop too. I say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in them and that have crime in them too. So people see that and they're like I wanna try this sometime. So then they call their buddies and say let's try this and most of them do then they're in trouble. So I think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things might change. Make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids. You could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens. To me things would possibly change if we get all the naughty things out of books, magazines, and music. Movies, this is a big one; just about all the movies are bad. There are some good ones out there if you look. But I don't know how we could change the movies by any chance at all. That was my opinion on things. I hope it all makes sense about how I feel and how I think about things and why removing offensive material is important.
605	3582	2	3	Why censor something that someone worked hard on? People put up money and countless amounts of time to write this and yet you want to censor it. See, there is honestly no need to censor anything in the library because there are certain sections for certain people; therefore, this whole conversation shouldn't be going on in the first place. People just like to nitpick about what they cannot handle; for instance, like the word nigger, I don't like it at all but I can handle it and therefore I just shut my mouth and suck it up. So I just feel like all the critique and all the immature people just need not to read or don't go to the library, but that's only me though. So stop acting like little children; the authors want their stuff on shelves and not being banned and raved and ranted about. They deserve to have their work available for those who wish to read it. In conclusion, stop being immature and if you don't like it, don't read it. Always think to yourself about what you're doing before you decide to complain about a book's content.
606	3583	2	3	I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I think offensive books, movies, music, and etcetera should be removed from shelves because that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something inappropriate, it is okay to watch. I would not want my brother or sister to watch or see anything that is not appropriate for their age. I remember there was a time I was thirteen years old and my mom and stepdad at the time did not agree that I should have @PERSON1, @CAPS1, or @NUM1 on my television. They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on @CAPS2 and it was inappropriate in their opinion. I disagreed with that; I thought I should have the right to watch it because I liked the shows and they were interesting to watch. Everything that was on @CAPS2 was not as bad in my opinion. When I would watch music videos on @CAPS1, every song that was being played was the edited version. I had to argue and prove a point in why I should have @NUM2, @NUM1 on my @CAPS2. Parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children. In my case, my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad. She knew what it was like when she was young. She thought that maybe I would think what I see on @CAPS2 is not a bad thing and would be influenced by it. I was thinking to myself that oh well I am young and I will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad through my own experiences.
607	3584	2	3	Taking the @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 is a fundamental part of engaging with literature. Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point. The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community. Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre. The reader should know where he or she stands among these categories, so they will not be unexpectedly offended. Maturity comes with understanding and the ability to process challenging content. Books are sorted by genre. Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre. The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor. When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration. If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D., the author would not want to use grammar from the present day, as it would break the historical immersion. The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so, perhaps through ratings or summaries. From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution. Maturity comes with understanding the context and purpose of a work. If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2, then the book corresponds with the age of that child. This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community.
608	3585	2	3	Should we take off books that are offensive? I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive. If we do take off the offensive stuff off the shelf, then there are not any more left on the shelf. If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that is offensive to us, then there will be no books, movies, or music on the shelf at all. First of all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the shelf. All the hippies will take the war stuff off because they don't like war. They will say that it is offensive to them and take them off. I think that we should read about war and watch films about it because it is a good way to learn from our mistakes. If we don't learn the mistakes of war, we will lose, and we won't learn how we lost, and we will go into war over and over again; we will win some and lose a lot because we won't learn how we lost previously. Secondly, all the music that is good and bad will be taken off the shelf. All the mothers that are too protective will take them down. It has bad language in it and a bad theme to it. If they take them down, how can the football players, soldiers, and fighters be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pumped up for the game or battle? Finally, they will take out all the books of Star Wars and Forgotten Realms. Some people don't like them because they think that it won't come true and they will take them out and say that it offends them on their thinking-wise. Star Wars is a good book and movie series, and Forgotten Realms is a good book maker company. All of this is why I don't want this to happen; all the good music, books, and movies will go away and the people who like them will get mad and lose access to the media they enjoy.
609	3586	2	3	Every person can think of something that they did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve? What if @NUM1 people came into a library with @NUM2 books, magazines, music, and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick what everyone else can access? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like elsewhere in the collection. If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it, should they have the right to demolish it just like nothing? The world would have never-ending chaos if people had too much power to change things according only to their personal tastes. It could only get worse from there. I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping an item. One solution could be to just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have separate parts of a room that are divided into all maturity ranges and content types. If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people, you will realize that no certain person should be able to take away that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy.
610	3587	2	3	Yes, I believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in them, such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of ANY human, etc. But the music part is up in the air because, like, kids hearing songs with cussing and talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldn't necessarily be removed. The way I see it, everybody's gonna learn about it somehow, and when you hear songs for multiple times, you tend to begin to know the words. And if you repeat the words in front of a parent, that's when they can step into the parent role and tell them that the drugs and words are not good and explain why they are harmful. Really though, if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says, then I feel like they should know right from wrong by then. Clearly, if someone is using bad language such as the @CAPS1 word, they would know that it's wrong from prior teaching, and if they continue to listen to it or use it, that is on them and their personal choice at that point.
611	3588	2	3	If I was to write about this to a newspaper, I believe that certain books should not be available for children and should be taken off the shelf. The reason I say that is so our children are not getting ideas from a book that is not appropriate for them. I think that is the main reason there are more girls getting pregnant at a young age. I think if we were to take off the naughty books there would be less girls pregnant. I really think it could work if we would take all of the naughty books off the shelf and make it a law that you had to be a certain age to look at them. I would like to see a change in the way we look at naughty books. I think you should be eighteen to look at books that are naughty. It would be a good thing to try for a while. I think it would work because it would not be showing to our children and they would not want to have babies as a teenager. This is the way I think it should have been done in the first place. We would not have so many problems in the first place. The thing is I think they do not think it will be too hard to raise a child at a young age. If we would not have to see things that we should not have seen, then our children would not be exposed to such ideas so early in their lives, and that would be a positive change for everyone involved.
612	3589	2	3	Censorship is a growing problem in today's world of literature. Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to. Katherine Paterson says that if we were all allowed to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about. Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society. In the novel 'Fahrenheit 451' censorship is one of the main themes of the story. Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions. Montag finds that the burning of books has led the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them. The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society. When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy. Montag decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not exercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless. So when he tries to memorize a part of the Bible, he cannot retain what he has been reading. Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn. The members of this novel's society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world. What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day. In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved. In a normal society, learning leads to questioning. But for them there is no learning, just accepting. And acceptance leads to contentment, which in the end leads to unhappiness. The society in 'Fahrenheit 451' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways. To them, death is not a big deal. Clarisse was killed by a speeding car, and Mildred, Montag's wife, was not even shocked to hear it. Another example is when Montag was running from the police, and a car full of rambunctious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to. At the end of the novel, Montag is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes. The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday! A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed. Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer. Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about. Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenager's mind at least once. But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well, because that is the true safeguard against ignorance.
613	3590	2	3	Do I think that books, movies, music, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves just because they are offensive? No, I don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just because someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this, if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelf because I think it's offensive, then we wouldn't have anything to watch, listen to, or even read. I understand that yes, people do have rights and their beliefs on something, but it doesn't mean that they have any say so on what should stay or what should go. If we let people do this than nobody would be able to watch, read, play, or even listen to anything for fun. We people use these things for having something to keep us entertained. Let's say this, we all know how little children have their imagination and they use that to keep them entertained just like us older people use books, music, movies, and etc. to keep us entertained. Well if we don't have this stuff then we would be lost and won't know what to do without that stuff. Just think of our little kids if we take their imagination away then they would be lost and hopeless because that's how they learn and grow up. We people use this every day use to not only keep us entertained but to also help us learn more about whatever we need to learn about to survive in every day life. See in ways we are not so different from our children at all really. They use whatever they find or see to keep them entertained and for enjoyment. If people really thought about what they are really going to do by removing something from the shelves then they would regret that what they did was stupid because now they don't have anything to read, listen to, or even watch. I my own self have had experience on what it's like to have something like that pulled down from the shelves before and it's really not cool at all for that to happen. Taking something off the shelves that is a little bit offensive doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves. I think that if people who took something off the shelves just because one person thought that it was offensive is wrong and should not take something down that maybe other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down before even reading it yourself is stupid on behalf of your part because maybe other people like it and maybe you would like it who knows. I just think that people should really think before they go and take something off the shelves without having a lot of people giving you a bad comment on it before just taking one person's opinion on it, as that is the only way to ensure a diverse and enriching world of media for everyone.
614	3591	2	3	Offensive or Inappropriate? Who can truly say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truly offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive? While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The Bible' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was not a suitable thing for their child to read. For many families, though the Harry Potter series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should. While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would not be interesting, and there would be no music. If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would not have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on The Beatles and mine is of Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a bookstore. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look. Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scenes in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of Harry Potter, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact. People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is not one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of every store, and that is the complex reality of personal taste.
615	3592	2	3	As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages but there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should separate their books only as they do already. Some material does seem too advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic growth. Some people should think that schools should not read Mark Twain due to racism in the south. This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those sort of restrictions then schools would lack much of history's best literature. Just as the movies do for the general population, PG-13 is for thirteen and up while R is for seventeen and up. These are good standards that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem. Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sections up more then they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main categories that most people want separate due to offensive material such as drugs, sex, and alcohol. Much of the media that is public today is censored and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the youth can stunt them academically, and a balanced approach is therefore the most sensible solution for everyone.
616	3593	2	3	Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and music that are offensive to some of the people? In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards. Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal. Music can be offensive to some people because of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children listen to it, and children nowadays say things they hear from music and try to be like the person saying it. Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie would be Saving Private Ryan. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today. Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that. Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are offensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore it's not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it.
617	3594	2	3	Censorship? What is it? Well from what I know censorship is where you are blocked from certain things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it. So the question is it wrong to censor something or not, I think that libraries should be able to censor certain things that people find offensive. First reason why I think it is right that people should be able to censor things is because little children could be able to take a peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies. Next reason why I think libraries should be able to censor is because people can find certain things offensive just as music, for example like vulgar language can be listened to and also naughty things can be watched in movies. My last reasoning why I think it is fair that libraries are able to censor things is because some people like to read but in their reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a library. These are reasons why I think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines. My first reasoning in why I think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little children could be able to look at things they should not be able to take a peek at. These things could be like pornography, and also really gruesome things in magazines and in movies. If these things were in libraries they can possibly show other children, in which it would not be good. This can be a problem because parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children. Also I think they should be able to censor movies because little children should not be watching gruesome movies at a young age. This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on these movies and magazines. Also libraries can censor music. I also think libraries can censor music because in music these days there are very bad things that anybody can find that is offensive. Little children can be listening to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people. This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying, so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners. Also they should be able to censor movies again because naughty things can be shown in those movies that certain age levels should not be able to see. These are reasons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies. They also have right to censor books. Books in the libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certain books such as books about faith and other religions. And also about gruesome items. Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people may not see eye to eye about other religions. And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so people won't find it to be offensive. And also libraries should be censoring certain books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive. So this is why I think libraries should be able to censor things. In conclusion libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death, movies because in some movies it can show pornography and gruesome things that people should not be watching, and they should be able to censor magazines and music because in magazines children could be looking at certain things they should not be looking at. And they should be able to censor music because people can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language. So in other words I do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines.
618	3595	2	3	Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, it makes it hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some may enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries. Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located. On the back of movies there is a rating on how bad the movie is. Why not put a rating on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read it. It would also help them decide if they even want to read it. Ratings on the back of magazines and books would help distinguish what age is appropriate for it. Once, when I was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. He was returning the book that he had just read and checking out the new one he had already picked out. When it was finally his turn in line he stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what he had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that he wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, 'How did you like your book, sir?' He replied ' It wasn't what I expected. It was completely inappropriate. ' As they discussed a little more it turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of how people don't know what to expect when they read a book. I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or watch the movies. Some people may not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others may find it outrageous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find it offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reassure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by it.
619	3596	2	3	Should They or Should They Not? What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about their appearance or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should not be hearing this or having to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion I do not think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them how to be like that? One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though a lot of kids have to listen to their parents fight and yell. So, why don't they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to? There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelves. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your children get it. As being a teenager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldn't be listening to, but even if my daughter was sixteen there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what their child gets just because they don't care, well that's not your problem. There should, however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or not. Books with sex scenes and murder should not be allowed into the eight year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldn't be allowed to read something that adults do. Most ten year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen pregnancy. As much as they should get information on it, have their parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and a lot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they haven't done anything so far is because not enough parents care. This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing. This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why aren't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or not. Last but not least try to talk your librarian into making groups of books. Some for the younger kids some for the older. Wouldn't kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and not just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and not let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!! Make a say!!
620	3597	2	3	Some people think that offensive books should be off the shelves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed. I do not believe that certain materials like books, movies, and magazines should be removed. If we take every book off the shelf then we would not have any book to read. If we start taking offensive books off the shelf then every body coming in would be taking one book off the shelf. Then within two days there would be no books left. If we do not have any books then our eyes would be bad from not reading. We should not take books off the shelves because some people like to read and they need the materials. If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books; they can find other places for their reading. This is why people should not take offensive books off the shelves. This will make people's eyes so bad that they would not see good at all from a lack of reading practice and available materials.
621	3598	2	3	Reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others. Do I think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves? There are some things that could be censored, and others that wouldn't be worth using if it was censored. However, yes I do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored. I am going to tell you why they should be censored, and what should be censored. The types of items in the library that shouldn't be cleaned up. A perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer, as altering them would distort the factual record. There are other types of library items in the library that could be censored. Like there are some magazines and movies that show uncensored scenes or pages that are not need to make a view across if there even is a view to get across. I think a movie, book, or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is trying to get a point across, such as an important social message. If there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library, as they serve no purpose other than to offend. As people can see library there are circumstances where a book, movie, or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information. There are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive and gratuitous. If you ask me if I think censorship is important in libraries than I would have to say yes and no, depending entirely on the context and purpose of the material. I just gave you some reasons why I would say that. The next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important, or is its value greater than its potential to cause discomfort.
622	3599	2	3	Have you ever imagine goin to the libary and getting a magazine from the shelve and you find it offensive and you cant do anything about it? Well now you can say what ever you want because Katherine Paterson and me when to a libary together we pick out magazine from the shelve and it had alot of offensive stuffs we did not like, including language and images that were shocking. We went to the lady infront and she dint even knew this magazines where there. She got really mad and when back to the shelve and there where alot of magazines with offensive ritting, pictures and even comments that were completely inappropriate for a public space. We got all of the magazined anf threw them away. In my own opin i think these kind of things thar are offensive like movies, music, and magazines should be remove. They should be remove because it a bad influence to the younth, and it gives them a picture in there head and they do it later or maybe say it to the plubic or even so it in there homes, leading to negative behaviors. They should be remove because its getting alot of people in to trouble and making them do what they see of it, this is getting to kids and they becoming more violent to there school, friends and even moms, which is a serious concern for our community. We have to remove all of these offensive stuffs becasue we see these every where and its easy to find like in the movies it getting to the piont where you see naked girls in every movie, which desensitizes young viewers. The parents have to do something about it to because they are the one who are buying them and then leaving it every where in the house and its easy for the children to find it and be exposed to harmful content. We have to be more care full about what we but or what we read because you can find it offensive and then your kids read it and they would think another thing, potentially adopting the wrong ideas. So next time you buy or go some where and you find some thing offensive talk to the manager or the supervacer about taking it off. That why i think they should be remove to protect our community.
623	3600	2	3	Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement that parents should control all library content. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement. I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from, a place for free exploration of ideas. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there for others who may need or want it. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book, providing guidance rather than imposing broad restrictions. If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them and are more likely to respect the guidance. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting, containing complex themes for mature audiences. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it and should have that access. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate, which is a parent's responsibility. Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it, which seems unfair. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once when it could be freely available. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them and others still reading them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now or to remove them. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them by a small group's preferences. This is my opinion of the statement. Many people may not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy, preserving access for all. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them, ensuring libraries remain open to diverse ideas.
624	3601	2	3	Television, news, drama, life, and controversy. These are just a few of the things books are written about. Some subjects are considered to be vulgar and innappropriate for young audiences. Many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really such a good thing? Books have been an important tool for students for a long time. However, not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences. Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children. Books are censored for all sorts of reasons, from profanity to challenging themes. Some of these reasons are frivelous and should not keep a book from reaching it's full potential and audience. The truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line, and are banned, which is understandable for extreme content. Great. However, some books do not 'cross the line' and are banned regardless of their merit, which is a problem. Honestly, careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves, weighing its value against its potential harm. If a book is written with only minor obscenities by a recognized author, and it is banned, then the author faces no serious pressure as the banning will be well known and consumers will still purchase the book just for a chance to read it, often increasing its notoriety. However, if an author who is relatively unknown writes a well-put-together piece that contains a few spots where the author may have made a somewhat vulgar reference, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble, their career potentially ruined. This author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work can be recognized by a wider audience. Banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves and share their unique perspectives. Books that are especially vulgar should definitely be banned to protect the innocent. No child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults, with graphic and mature content. Children should be protected from such material, and book banning provides this service, creating a safer environment. If a child has a burning desire to read a book, they can simply ask their parents to buy it for them, assuming the parents agree that filthy books should be okay for children to read, thus placing the decision back in the family's hands. If a book can provide good discussion in a classroom setting, and is mostly 'clean', then it should certainly be available for everyone to learn from. Just because a book contains a few areas where innappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book and benefit from its overall message. If the learning material a book offers 'outweighs' the negative effects the book might have on a student, then the book should be available for students to read and critically engage with. However, because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a difficult statement to make and requires nuanced judgment. Honestly, it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book entirely from public access. Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult and subjective, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives, despite its flaws. In the end, a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one, as it errs on the side of protecting children from potential harm.
625	3602	2	3	I believe there should not be censorship in libraries, because if some needs to read a book about somthing and the library does not have it beacuse they do not believe or like what the book as to say it makes the reader not know what actually happened or what different viewpoints exist. The very first reason in believe there should not be any censorship in librarys is beacuse a lot of student go there to study about papers and to conduct research for their academic work. So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for the library is failing its maine purpose of providing information and supporting education. The sencond reason is that if the person in chage of the library does not like a book that does not mean he or she has to read the book, and books are ment for any one and everyone to read according to their own interests and needs. Personal dislike is not a valid reason for removal. Then the third is that a library is ment to have books so people can read them and gain knowledge, so if the owner takes the book out and some need that one book and the person can not get the information that they neeed out of that one book the library is faling its maine purpose of being a comprehensive resource. The fourth reason is that alot of people read books to read about something new or challenging, and just beacuse he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book away from others who may find value in it. Those are the three mane reasons i think librays should not have censorship, as it undermines their fundamental role. The owner of the library should have any book possibel and should not shose to not put a book in it beacuse he ore she does not like what the book says, ensuring a diverse and complete collection for all patrons.
626	3603	2	3	I am neutral on this subject because it does not matter to me whether they put new books, movies, music cds, or magazines on their shelves or if they take them off. The specific selection of materials available is of no personal concern. Also it does not matter to me if I have to pay for the things that I check out from the library, as the cost is not a significant factor in my use of the service. Also it does not matter at all if I had to pay a late fee for the books that I checked out from the library; such a fee would be a minor inconvenience at most. Also I do not care about any noises that go on in the library, whether from conversations or other activities. Also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library, be they fiction, non-fiction, or reference. Also it would not matter to me how the library is run, including its management structure or daily operations. Also I would not care if I had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me, as I can adapt to any required behavior. Also I would not care how long that I would stay in the library, whether for a brief moment or for several hours. Also it would not matter to me if I walked or drove or rode my bike to the library, as the method of travel is irrelevant to my purpose. Also I would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it, as that is not my judgment to make. Also if I got kicked out of the library I would simply go to another one without any hard feelings. Finally, it would not matter to me if I got ten books or movies from the library I would not care, as the quantity does not affect my fundamental indifference. Thoma.
627	3604	2	3	I think that the books should not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they dont like the book they should simply leave it on the shelf. There is no reason that the people would want to remove any book for any reason because a lot of people like different kinds of books and have diverse tastes. If they were to remove any books there would be a lot of people mad because those people might have really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it and share the experience. That book might have also been in their family for a really long time and they want everyone in their family to enjoy that book and its legacy. It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books to fill the space and that would cost more money to acquire new books; it will also waste more paper and resources in the process. Another reason that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book to replace the old one the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money from decreased interest and will not be good for them financially. So that is what I think would be my opinion about removing a book; it would not turn out very good and the book store will lose a lot of money because they got rid of a good book and brought back a really bad book that no one wants.
628	3605	2	3	Censorship in Libraries Censorship in libraries is a significant problem in today's society; many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read, what if they come across a book from the early 1900s? In these times there were lots of words used that are considered 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people don't understand is that these words that are harmful had different meanings and contexts in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or inappropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book's intent. And then, this small group of people who don't like this piece of literature, go against the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where I am going to explain to this small group of people a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away. When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they might come across a piece of literature that they don't completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on to another selection. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about its presence? Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book don't quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then I ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they don't try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf for others. Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature, a poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf for public access. So why would we not have the same rights to create? If we don't agree with some of the literature that is being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes, then we can write a novel, a newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic to express a different view. You can make web polls and much more to gauge public opinion. This is a more indirect and civil approach to challenging a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to receive other people's opinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one opinion on a subject, you might have a more likely chance of winning your argument through democratic means. And this will cause a lot less chaos and negative attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you. Another reason why I don't think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere is that I do not think that anybody from anywhere should be able to come into a library and permanently remove a piece of literature. Because, in today's society, we have researchers working all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws that require historical context. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the 1800s about evolution, and we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information for a new study? These scientists might need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future with a critical discovery. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us with our problems and understanding. So, now that I have told you all of my opinions on this subject, I hope that you will have a better view on the censorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers who can decide for themselves what is valuable.
629	3606	2	3	Curse words, alcohol, drugs, pornographic pictures. These are all things you would not like your children to use, see, or do. They are out in the world and there is nothing that you can do to stop their existence entirely. People do drugs and drink everyday, but just because someone sees you doing it doesn't mean they will automatically imitate the behavior. People should not be completely shielded from the real aspects of life, as this can be counterproductive. When shielded as a child they would not know what to do if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink; they might not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is when faced with such choices. Kids to a certain age deserve to know what's going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life on their own. It won't happen to everyone but they need to know these things to be prepared. It is important for parents to let their children know what is right or what is wrong through guidance and conversation. As an adolescent, they are very vulnerable to all the bad stuff that life can bring, and seeing these things in books, movies, magazines and etc. will effect their life in some way, either positively or negatively. It is ultimately the parents' job to show them the right path and provide a moral framework. A thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on, which provide a basic level of protection. On movies there are age restrictions that enable people at a certain age to be able to watch and people that are within those guidelines to have access, which helps filter content. With other materials like books, music, and magazines, there is no universal way to deny access to people to see or read them, so parents just need to be observant of their children and see what they do and engage with. Censorship is normally a bad thing as it limits freedom, but in other situations it could help by providing a buffer. For people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things, it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right or acceptable behavior. As much as people should be open and be able have access to this information, it is also important that other people who might be harmed did not see it. It is still an open debate with valid points on both sides, but, in my opinion, widespread censorship should not be done. Everyone has their own right to get and see the things they want, and personal responsibility should be emphasized.
630	3607	2	3	In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader with certain sensitivities. These books can appear unappealing and offensive to some. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written about, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval by others. The first reason that there should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press as fundamental rights. They are allowed to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in or passionate about. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate for some, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish and believe. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in Nazi Germany, which was a dark period for intellectual freedom. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader who can appreciate them. The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas often cover topics that have never been discussed before, pushing boundaries. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written in the future. The vast variety of literature is the primary reason why it is so popular and enduring across cultures. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language and shared stories. And though stories may not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read by anyone. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it with context. Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people with different interests. Though the materials found in a story might be horrific to a parent, it might be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people, such as adults who enjoy complex themes. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be paralleled with limiting a person's voice of opinion and personal choice. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people who meet a certain standard. Variety is what separates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's, which is a strength of a free society. Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced or encouraged. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose and a perspective. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights that stifles creativity. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf and limit access to ideas.
631	3608	2	3	Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive? Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making decisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should be taken off library shelves because someone finds them offensive. Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person? I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opinion, but maybe the next person that walks by and sees the so-called offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone else's decisions for them; if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their choice not someone else's to make for them. If every person took a book off the shelves that they thought to be offensive then we would no longer have any books on the shelves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and don't like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves? You can never say that any one thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? Well you may not, but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it, but is that fair? Ultimately, the diversity of available materials is what makes a library a valuable resource for an entire community with varied tastes and perspectives.
632	3609	2	3	Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you. He's only around thirteen years old just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responsibilities. He wants to try new things. He listens to his friends talking about drinking alcohol and how much fun it is. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He doesn't know if something is bad about it or not. No one ever told him. So he starts to drink and later died of alcohol poisoning. Now, you don't want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are too scared to talk about the bad things in life, like sex, drugs, etc., then they should make books and movies to show how bad these things are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you might say 'well they're too young they can't handle these things yet.' In your opinion you should think of their maturity level; also they can learn from other people's mistakes, and it would educate people. How do you tell someone's maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then they're not very mature. But, you can't associate that every fifteen year old is immature. Many people may take this as a serious thing. Others may not but, they still will be able to see them in their own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea. Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc., may have inappropriate things in them, like sex, drugs, drinking, and bad language. Should all these things be taken out of libraries and off the shelves? It's a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from their mistakes. If there's a movie and a guy is doing drugs and later dies, people could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other things? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they heard on the radio. But, when they hear that word or read about something or watch it, they can ask about it and we can say that saying those things or doing them can be offensive. Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listen, read, or watch about something offensive or etc.? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is, we should teach people about them. If we don't, it's bound to repeat itself. Say if we censor the holocaust because of how horrifying it was, no one would know about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things in a library would not be that good of an idea. Certain people can handle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these things to educate them, and also so they can learn what has been done and not repeat it; also, some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturity level. These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places, as access to information is crucial for learning and growth.
633	3610	2	3	Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensive and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library? When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every weekend. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My parents did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and my parents were okay with that and things like 'The Cat in the Hat', and 'Harry Potter'. Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; my dad likes country, my mom likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my uncle likes rock, and I like a combination of all of it. That just goes to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others. If we relied on people's opinions to keep our libraries free of offense, there would be nothing in it, proving that a one-size-fits-all approach to censorship is unworkable.
634	3611	2	3	If you take any of these books off the shelves that would be like taking away some of our childhood. That wouldn't be the nicest thing to do. Even if you did take some of them off then what would we show our children when they ask what was your favorite book as a kid? We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore. They had to make room for other books. So if you would please understand, we got to read all of our parents' favorite childhood books, and we want to share that same joy. I mean how would you feel if you couldn't share that with your kids? I would be upset because my parents told me and I went out and got them from the library and I loved them too. These stories connect generations. So please, if you can, leave the books alone and allow future children to discover the same magic we did.
635	3612	2	3	What is a library? A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc. With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment. Should there be censorship in libraries? In my opinion there should be very little censorship in a library. If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library. Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imagine, and dream. They don't worry about being offended by a particular type of book. However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately. For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it. What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard. If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room. If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severely they were offended take the appropriate measures. For instance if something just offended someone unintentionally leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionally by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf. Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar. While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended, creating a balanced environment for all patrons.
636	3613	2	3	Censorship in Libraries To remove something a person dislikes off of a shelf is assuming other people's opinions do not count. It really has to depend on what the product is, such as a book, a magazine, a music album, or a movie. Usually, in any store I've walked into, there are certain departments for each product. In these separate departments, the product is always categorized, not based on what people like, but by genre or age differences. If a person was to linger away from their section in that department and go to another part, their taste in their product will seem too different to like, but that does not mean the other section's items are without value. A local library in a person's community will have many books to read and to choose from. There are baby books, kids sections, and teenage and adult sections as well. The teenage section is for me! Although I used to always be in the kids section not that long ago, those books should not now be removed just because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up. Yet that is just me. However, the generation under me will soon love them and find them just as engaging as I once did. Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone else. Music is a different story. Some people like country and some people like alternative. In libraries, they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to before they rent it out. When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one. The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the sweetest music to their ears. That album might be another person's favorite. Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion. Yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated R movie. For them, it's only PG-13 movies. This is how I grew up. Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, I've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels. In libraries, some movies aren't allowed to be rented by a younger person, yet it doesn't mean they should be tossed out. When they are older they might actually like them and appreciate having access to them. Overall, a person's opinion will be the most important one to them, and other opinions won't matter as much. Products in a library are for anyone to view, not to judge for removal. If absolutely everyone did judge the products negatively, there wouldn't be any left for anyone to enjoy, defeating the library's purpose as a resource for the entire community.
637	3614	2	3	I believe that it is unfair to ban any sort of materials from the library. It simply isn't right to withhold information from your children. Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway. Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or CD? Then they can ask parents any questions that they might have about things they have read and heard, instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information from an unreliable source. If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine, wouldn't you like to know about it? Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong in a safe environment? Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certain things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small that could be easily explained? Any of the things that they might read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet. On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects, which can be more dangerous. Your child's curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites with just a few clicks, which is far less controlled than a library's curated collection. When I was a child and I was curious, my parents sheltered me from certain things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in second grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures, and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read in a book. I felt like I couldn't talk to my parents about these things. I mean, what would you do if your second grader came home from school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus? What if the high schoolers had been lying to me? I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about without the proper context. What I'm saying is that I understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear, but it isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions in a guided way. Besides, isn't it your fault in all reality if they get their hands on something inappropriate for their age because they aren't getting the proper supervision at the library or at home? If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is inappropriate, ask them questions about it. Explain things to them when they ask you a question, and don't beat around the bush. Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truly is not fair to take these materials away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it, which only fuels their curiosity further.
638	3615	2	3	No, because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history or important literature. Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out about the world. When I was in middle school I always liked to read Stephen King and R.L. Stine books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and violence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in, because everybody is different and all people like different types of books. There are all kinds of books; for example, there are mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books, but they're not books you read everyday for fun. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book they are genuinely interested in. When I was in elementary and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer. In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also had a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most books. That was part of our grade in our English class. It was never a problem for me because I loved to read. Now, there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves, for example any book that involves nudity or lots of violence. Now that's just for kids that are under the age of thirteen, as a general guideline for age-appropriateness. Now there aren't that many books out there for little kids to read that are challenged; there are more adult books than little kids books that face censorship attempts. All I have to say is that you should watch what your kids read, but don't keep them from reading books because that will affect them later on in life. If they don't like to read, persuade them to try it with a book on a topic they love. I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too, setting a good example. Just remember, kids and adults of all ages, reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read, as it opens up new worlds and ideas.
639	3616	2	3	In this persuasive essay I'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelves, and there are a couple reasons that are going to help me do that. I think that we shouldn't take anything off the shelves in libraries. My first main point why we should not take any material off the shelves in libraries is that there is some material that people might find offensive that others do not, and they are getting affected by those who do want these materials removed. I think that some of the movies and books that are taken off the shelves could be material that some kids should experience, as it might help them understand complex issues in the future. My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelves, there would only be movies and books like Bambi and Scooby-Doo left, because all material in libraries could be considered offensive to people in some ways different than others. I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found personally offensive, as I understand that taste is subjective. Also, if we do remove all so-called offensive items, we might as well not even have a library, because there would only be about ten movies and books in the whole building, because of all of the offensive material that people could find in CDs, books, and movies if they look for it. People hear cuss words probably everyday, whether it's at school or at home, so all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them in the school hallway. I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and a book, not as a direct instruction manual for life. Scary movies are not real, and some books are pure fantasy as well. There is sex and other inappropriate things in some movies, but that's also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies, which is a system that already works to control access. To summarize what I was just talking about in the last couple of paragraphs, I think that we should not take anything off the shelves in libraries, because it will hurt others who want to access that material, and there's just no need in it when other solutions, like age ratings and good parenting, already exist to guide young readers and viewers.
640	3617	2	3	When I walk into a library to look for a book, I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books, movies, or magazines on open display. When I see that, I think, 'What if a child saw this?' I would like a library for my child to visit without me worrying about the things they could see accidentally. To fix this problem, the libraries could do a number of things that don't involve removing materials entirely. First off, the libraries could better censor what they put out on the selves by improving their organization. By putting the adult books section by the check out place, an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section and gently redirect them. If that solution does not work, then try and rate the sections like we rate movies, creating a clear and intuitive system. Put G-rated books and movies together, PG-rated books and movies together, PG-13 and R-rated books and movies together, and so on, so that families can easily find the area suited to their age group. One time, when I took my baby brother to the library, he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out. I was shocked and embarrassed that it was so easily accessible in the children's area or on a low shelf. I did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library, but it did, highlighting the need for better organization. I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice, so I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed entirely from the library's collection. However, they should be placed in better order and in designated sections so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff during a routine visit, thus respecting both access for adults and the concern of parents.
641	3618	2	3	Should the library be censored on the books it has on the shelves? I think it should be. There are many offensive books and things on the shelves containing profanity, violence, and other inappropriate content. I wouldn't want my kid or anybody else's kid reading offensive books. So let's get rid of all the bad stuff or at least filter it all. I believe any book, movie, and magazines that have a lot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be checked out to a certain age. If they want to keep the books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permission slip signed by a parent to get the books. Removing the books and things completely would cause too much trouble so we should definitely make sure the kid is a certain age and has permission. I would not want my eight year old kid reading a book with bad language in it. Kids catch on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. There is a lot going on in society nowadays that badly influences children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are criminals. I think that's why we have so much of a problem today because everyone sees it at a young age and they want to be like that when they get older but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. If we do not filter what they do at a young age they will end up being hellions and out of control because they will think just because someone in a book or movie did it that it's ok for them to do it but it's not. I would not want a young kid to read bad things. I say let's put an age limit on them and make our society better and our kids to become better adults later on in their life. We need to filter out the bad and put new, more suitable material in for our younger kids. If we don't, who knows how they'll grow up to be; the world could go to hell if we don't stop the kids from learning bad things. So let's get the filtering started and save the world and our kids' future by taking this responsible step now.
642	3619	2	3	Thoughts of Literature I feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries. If a piece of literature is particularly offensive; the piece should not be displayed for general access. From my own experience, controversy is the primary reason that books are stricken from libraries. All of my experience, observations, and reading have told me one thing. That one thing being, pieces of literature are taken away because of their offensiveness to certain groups or sensibilities. From the experience that I have had with books that cause controversy, I have noticed myself not liking the book and feeling uncomfortable. I believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries; they find the content disagreeable or upsetting. Coming from someone who does not particularly like reading, I feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though I would not like to read any longer. All of my experiences seem to point to not reading books that cause distress or controversy, as they hinder the enjoyment of reading itself. Of all that I have observed, I have found similar things as my experiences. I have seen people, classmates in particular, that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them or presented ideas they find objectionable. Though my observations this year seem one-sided, I truly have observed more lack of reading due to controversy than the increasing of reading due to controversy. All of my observations seem to point to supporting the revocation of 'banned books' to create a more comfortable environment. The piece that I have noticed most prominent to this topic that I have read would most definitely be Fahrenheit 451. In said novel society has outlawed all books. The story seems to heavily favor those who wish to read controversial novels, though we can take something from reading this book. The reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument, as people lived happily without controversial books causing them distress. Granted not all people did, but that is because of certain variables and a desire for knowledge that ignored comfort. From stories, such as the three little pigs and the big bad wolf, we can understand how poorly the concept of controversiality is drawn. For instance, I was mortified hearing that the first time due to its violent themes. I have never had the interest of hearing it again, as I felt that the story is not politically correct and promotes fear. Pieces of literature are taken away because of their offensive properties. If someone has no interest in reading a book because of the thoughts maintained inside of the text; the book must be stripped from the public to maintain a peaceful and agreeable atmosphere. As it would only make sense to try to keep the peace and prevent discomfort, I for one support the cause to remove books from public places due to controversiality for the greater good.
643	3620	2	3	People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive. The problem with the library system is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people. The truth is that when you have as many people as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes, and it is impossible to please everyone. Libraries are places of knowledge. They keep many different books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library and find something that interests them. Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like. So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not and simply choose another. Magazines are like books in a way. People know what they want to read about. With magazines though, people usually just flip through the pages, and skim through articles looking for topics that catch their eye. They will keep skimming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read, and then they are content. Usually after that, they are done with the magazine and move on. Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around. There is something about music that soothes the human body and soul. Music is one of those things that is constantly changing with time and evolving with culture. Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced and complex. Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't, and there never will be. There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music from classical to heavy metal. There are people who hate change. Likewise they don't like to change their favorite music types or try new things. But if people changed with time completely, then there would really only be a few types of music popular at once. But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played because they find it disagreeable. Just in the last century movies have came a long way in advancement. Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it for its innocence. But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change and become more complex. Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on, reflecting a wider range of human experience. Directors try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie and engaged. But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive or too much for them. Movies are supposed to be entertaining, not something people should get offended by, but enjoyment is subjective. Movies are good about it though; they have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to expect in the movie before they even buy a ticket. It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it, and that is a simple fact of life. There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing in itself. It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same and has different tastes and sensitivities. So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will, and therefore we should not remove items just for causing offense.
644	3621	2	3	Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? Personally I don't think they should be. If there is something in the book that is remotely offensive towards children then it should be put under a section for adults only, not banned entirely. Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group, which is a sensible solution. If there is a book that is racially unacceptable then it should be put in the adult section not anywhere for children to accidentally find. When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not they should review all the possibilities of how someone might comprehend the story to see their reaction with it and judge its context. There are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so there is always a place that the book can go to where it is more appropriate. Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it and whether it is necessary. For example, in class we just finished reading the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' There is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the 'n-word' and its historical use. It is a very harsh word, but it goes with the setting and the background of the story, providing a valuable lesson. When someone is not sure if a book is acceptable or not they should take in consideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is needed or not for the narrative's purpose. In many cases the unacceptable thing might work along with the story to teach something important. If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned under the same strict rules? If something is not allowed for one item then it shouldn't be allowed for something else, which would lead to endless censorship. It is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it and their maturity level. I have read many books that have certain words that don't bother me, but someone else who isn't use to it might not like and that is their right. Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate stuff from the type of music they listen to, so they should guide their own children. It all comes down to who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music, making it a personal choice. Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking the books off of the shelves then eventually there wouldn't be any books left on the shelves anymore due to differing opinions. Just because something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from peoples enjoyment and access to diverse ideas.
645	3622	2	3	If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' When you asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always given, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, 'Because if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it? It was simply a matter of parental guidance. Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things and perhaps appreciate them differently. How would it change things if those movies, music, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them as an adult? What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch 'that one classic movie' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive for their own family? I would also like for you to think about the child you might have or may plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as 'Scary Movie' or 'Superbad' as a ten year old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence entirely? Then they would never see them and to some that might be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today and are widely available. 'Scary Movie' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that I could throw at you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language which are common in modern media. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies watched by adults. There are many movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them, reflecting real life. You might be able to get rid of a few titles through complaint, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them because tastes vary so widely. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes that you find objectionable. What would there be left to watch for anyone? If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch when they are older, only children's cartoons and educational documentaries? Not only that, but what movies would you watch for your own enjoyment
646	3623	2	3	I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes; they are seeking knowledge or entertainment without such concerns. On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it, as it preserves the creator's original intent and artistic integrity. Take for example a book about @PERSON1. It could have some things in it that people could find offensive. But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible, and censoring parts of the text could lead to an incomplete or biased understanding. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album, allowing the patron to make their own choice. There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad. Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author. I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all, as it allows for a more authentic and comprehensive engagement with the material.
647	3624	2	3	A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out? Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play. But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning. Libraries have movies that are rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. They @MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the @CAPS5. Some libraries @MONTH1 not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others. In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves to protect children. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and @CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired for neglecting their duty. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages. In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents by ensuring the content is suitable. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements to maintain a safe and respectful environment.
648	3625	2	3	Censorship at the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though, such as for materials that are clearly harmful or inappropriate for any audience. It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them, which undermines their authority and responsibility. The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it and focus on the overall value of the work. Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted. There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read. The library shouldn't censor their books and should instead trust individuals to make their own informed choices.
649	3626	2	3	The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive by only a segment of the population. Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right based on personal discomfort. By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1. However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'. If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere. Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them, often making the banned material even more appealing.
650	3627	2	3	I belive that the view on censorship in libraries are fine as they are for many reasons. The main reasons that i belive censorship in libraries are fine are that almost everything in the library are for people to learn about weather they read it or watch a movie about it, and exposure to diverse ideas is crucial for education. Another reason is that if they took everything that was offecsive or unliked then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries, severely limiting the resources available for research and personal growth. I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something. They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it that could change their perspective. There are things in life that people need to be opened to or informed about even though they @MONTH1 not always be plesent. Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information in a structured and reliable setting? To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive but other people @MONTH1 learn from it and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else based on individual sensibilities. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still opened to a wide source of information that reflects the complexity of the world.
651	3628	2	3	Censorship in Libraries I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In today's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see or hear, content that can negatively influence their developing minds. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.  Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they admire doing a certain thing, it has a great impact on their own choices. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model, thus avoiding a potential negative influence.  Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it, such as vandalism or theft. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies and did not understand the real-world consequences.  Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers or his idols do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life and the environments they frequent.  Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from personal experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me, believing such behavior is normal or acceptable. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used to filter out such harmful portrayals.  In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished, creating a safer and more positive environment for young minds. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.
652	3629	2	3	People from all over the world have many different opinions and perspectives on what is acceptable. If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it or simply selecting another book or movie. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it for everyone else.  One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone will feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read or find valuable.  Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth, as it can reflect real life or provide a certain kind of entertainment. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not due to another's personal sensibilities.  In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are inherently bad or without merit. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny, or to provoke thought and discussion, which are important parts of learning and growing.  Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate for some, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do, rather than imposing them on an entire community through removal of materials.
653	3630	2	3	There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences due to their content. By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them for easier and more responsible access.  In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone without restriction. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated R, the parents would most likey become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated R movie. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a PG-13 rating. In which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out, creating a difficult situation for librarians. Furthurmore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child can not see a rated R movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inapropriate materials, just as video stores and theaters do. By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of, preventing accidental exposure to mature content.  Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship policies to be more age-aware. It would give them a better name as a responsible institution, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these matirials when they are developmentally ready for them.
654	3631	2	3	Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible on any subject? I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books, meaning a wide and diverse collection with minimal restrictions. In my opinion it would be beneficial to students, parents, or teachers to get information on different topics, even those that are controversial. As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they may not be familier with, and allowing all the types of books would help anybody with any topic they are researching.  A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something, find an interesting read, or just relax and explore new ideas. If your going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about, it would be nice to find a book telling all about the topic, providing a comprehensive view. This would help students with reports, along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic, fostering a more educated community.  If a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library, then I think that person should just try and ignore the books that bother them. I think this because I dont think books should be taken out that are beneficial to others, just because it is offensive to someone that could just ignore it and choose something else to read.  Maybe the books are about drugs, sex, or violence, but they still are able to teach many people that aren't already knowledgable about the innappropriate, or offensive topics, providing crucial context or warnings about real-world issues.  In conclusion, throwing books out and keeping a library heavily censored, would be a mistake for a community. It is a mistake because it is taking away from many people who are wanting to become knowledgable about different topics and form their own opinions. It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school, or even work, ultimately limiting intellectual freedom and growth.
655	3632	2	3	No, cause if that is the case evry book you read could be offense to somebody somewhere. If they think the book is bad then don't read it; it is a simple solution that respects individual choice. First off a book should not be banned from a libary. It is just a book, a collection of words and ideas. Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama or impose their views on others. Third reason every book could be offense to somebody, so where would the banning ever stop?  First off they should not band a book just because people don't like its content or themes. If your child read an adult book that is good for them, for reading those big words and expanding their vocabulary. And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world; it can be a teaching moment about art or human biology. I bet it is not the first time they have encountered such a thing and it won't be the last in their lives, so sheltering them completely is impractical.  Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama or gain attention. They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author and the publishing community, creating unnecessary conflict over subjective content.  Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary left with any books. Cause any body can says something is offense for any reason, making it impossible to please everyone. In all they should not band one book, as doing so sets a dangerous precedent that can lead to the removal of many valuable and important works.
656	3633	2	3	In libraries there are certain materials on the shelves that may be offensive to some people. I have seen some of these materials in with my own eyes. But Should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter? Thats the question. Some might find it offensive and others may not. It all depends on the person and their individual sensibilities. Libraries cant please everyone, as what is acceptable to one might be objectionable to another. In my opinion libraries should not take these materials off the shelves, because a material that they take off the shelf could be a material that another person enjoys. Just because you dont take the material off the shelf doesn't mean that there aren't other solutions for those that think the materials should be tooken off the shelfs. Some solutions to fix this problem could be to take these 'offensive materials' and put them on taller shelves or in a room by thereselves so that children or people who do not like the idea dont have to see these certain materials. Then 'people who find it offensive' and 'people who dont' both get a side in this matter and it solves the solution to the problem. If this solution doesn't work there are many more. The librarie can take out the really offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all, but only after careful consideration and broad consensus. Overall I do not think libraries should take out these materials. Just try to make people on the offensive and nonoffensive side both happy then there will be no more conclusions as in this one, and the library can remain a place for all.
657	3634	2	3	Yes I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out the library because the libary is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know. Here is why I say this. If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is apppraite for people to see then it should be taken off the shelf. I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if childern are involed. People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn. The libary is a learning enviorment where education, growth and devolopement should be inspired, and materials that contradict this purpose do not belong there. My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf. I know that childeren should be able to go to a liabrary and be satistfied on the way the libary is, without encountering content that is upsetting or inappropriate for their age.
658	3635	2	3	Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad. What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get the materials they are allowed to have. I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library. So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people who wish to access it.
659	3636	2	3	I believe that if there is a book in a library that a child is not allowed to read that the book should be some where the kid shouldnt be able to get it. I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library were a child shouldn't have access to. Also the library should have a section to where only the certain age can read that book. In some libraires there are a bunch of books that are not made for a child to read and they have them to where a child can get access to them and that shouldnt be allowed. So i believe that they shouldn't allow children to get access to those types of books. The same thing applies in a store. In some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see. I know in the grocery store that i go to there are inaproperiate images and words that a child should see or read. So there should be an area inside that store that a certain age can access them because one day i was in the store and i saw a little kid reading a magazine and saying the bad words that were in it and looking at the bad pictures it also had in it. So that is the reason they should put the magazines in a place were children shouldn't get access to them. In the same store there is a music section and there are children in it all the time. The music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these off the shelves and take it home and listen to it. This is the part that is the parents fault by buying the CD for the child to listen to. So if the parent buys the child that CD that is bad it is the parents fault. But i think that the CD's for little children should be in one part of the store and the CD's for the older people should be where the can get access to it. This same thing applies with movies. There are movies in stores that are rated from G, PG, PG-13, R, and even for NC-17 audiences only. In a bunch of the movies form PG-13 abd up have a bunch of stuff in them that a child should not see. Like in the NC-17 audiences only movies they show nudity and a lot more stuff that no one under 17 shouldnt see but they have some of those just sitting on the shelves at stores. So children shouldn't be able to have access to those types of movies. The reason i explained all of this is so children dont get ahold of them. Like in the music if the kids start listening to some bad music they will start saying those bad words and get in trouble at school and anywere else. Even if the chid reads a book that has bad stuff in it they will start saying those words or even do the stuff that happens in the book. In the movies that a child is not suppost to see like a gory action movie or a movie that shows nudity or even a movie that cuses that child will see that movie and will show there friends or get ideas form the movie. And these are the reasons why a child shouldn't be allowed to get access to this kind of stuff, to protect their innocence and development.
660	3637	2	3	Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials. I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think. If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like. Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and might find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book. I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people, as this sets a dangerous precedent for censorship.
661	3638	2	3	Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive. First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people may like certain kinds of books and movies while others may not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem. I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it in a designated section. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem, as parents can then guide their children more easily. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library. All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive, and that organization is a better solution than censorship.
662	3639	2	3	I'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take it easy on me. Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation, taken in whatever direction they so choose for it to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if it were censored. It is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way to scary for them, plus it shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch it. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about it of course. The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see certain books in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side, clearly marked for different age groups. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them to help them select appropriate material.
663	3640	2	3	There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines,ect., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country. Consumers are constanly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying. Some parents may not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying. Some of the material may be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them. But if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem. That is why these materials should remain on the shelves. One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumers choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items. People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy. If they do not want to buy or check these materials out then then they should just go to another shelf, or shop at another store. I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go the other way and be very involved. If stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice. It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers. The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions. If they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice. These offensive items can not just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them. With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores. No matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials. On television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff. I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers. It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers. If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare. If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a little selection at the libraries. By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another persons favorite book. People can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language. There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers. From my personal experience I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books. Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words. There is a variety of materials available to the public that may be offensive to some, especially to their little children. As a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown. People can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some. This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kind of materials. If they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store. It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, ect..
664	3641	2	3	I believe that if you are at a library or movie store, or where ever and there are books,movies, magazines, or cd's that you think are offensive that they should most likley be taken off of the shelf. Have you ever walked into a store and seen something not approprite for little kids, and you get a little embarassed yourself?I know I have at least one point and time in my life. Which is why I believe that it should be removed from the store, or at least the shelves to maintain a family-friendly environment. I always try to think of how my grandparents would feel if they new what kind of music most teen's are listening to today. There is so much terrible language and talking about violence and bad things that really just isnt appropriate for anyone to hear, or even talk about, especially in a public space. Some people feel differant about this, and some people take it a little to serious, but you have to remember everyone has their own opinion on what constitutes offensive content. Ultimately, I think it's better to err on the side of caution and remove materials that could be deemed inappropriate for a general audience.
665	3642	2	3	Dear school paper, I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well. For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books for a reason. First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books without supervision. Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive and feel unwelcome. However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive. Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view before making a final judgment.
666	3643	2	3	When you go places, there will always be something that one won't like, as not everyone likes everything. A public library, by its very nature, has to be one of the worst places for people not liking things, given the vast array of materials it holds. Censorship in libraries is getting worse and worse every day; it is present in everything from books and movies to music and magazines. Should we keep things like this on the shelves? Everyone that will read this will think differently about the issue of censorship in libraries. On the shelves are lots of things with bad language and naughty pictures. These are books that little kids can easily pull off a shelf and see things that their parents do not want them to see. It is important to remember that censorship is everywhere, not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a genuine need for things like this, then perhaps there should be a special store for such materials, keeping them separate from general public access. This approach could help address concerns without resorting to widespread removal of materials from library collections.
667	3644	2	3	Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools today. There might be a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library because it has been removed. A lot of books that are considered great educational resources have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, often because they are deemed either too violent or because they contain bad language. If individual kids or parents are personally offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out; personal choice should be sufficient. There should not be institutional censorship on books in schools. There have been a lot of books, which teachers view as being highly educational, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. These are often books that teachers would like to give to their class to read to foster discussion and learning. There should not be any significant problem with giving a student a book that has a few bad words, or a few violent scenes for them to read and analyze. Some of the books that are banned could deeply relate to a student's own life, and touch them in a meaningful way. Banning books in libraries needs to change. People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are many books that are very good that have been banned. 'The Catcher in the Rye' for example was banned in many public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and I could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of literature needs to be open to everybody, no matter the age, so they can form their own opinions. Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many people's lives could be changed, touched, or moved due to a powerful book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have a profound effect on someone's life. People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it, fostering a more educated and thoughtful society.
668	3645	2	3	I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be genuinely offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of thing. For example, in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me but for other people too. Offensive for me is when it's not an appropriate thing, like certain explicit images, videos or bad words that should not be used for everybody to hear or see, especially in a shared public space. You have to be careful when you decide something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion. We have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best for our own development. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music entirely, I'm just saying that there is a time and a place for everything. We are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us but also for the younger kids, and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have life experience and they often know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth something; if you think something is being bad, say it. It is also important to remember not to let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something that would be offensive for someone else, standing firm in your own values while respecting the rights of others.
669	3646	2	3	In today's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take all offensive materials away, we would be taking most of what is made for modern entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger, often for the worse. Well, why don't we do something about it instead of just talking? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something proactive. Adults can actively eliminate the amount of inappropriate materials the children take home with them by being more vigilant. If you were to walk into any store these days you would undoubtedly find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to separate these materials from the family oriented materials with ratings and store sections. Sometimes it is just not enough, as children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age through various media. These children then share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things, creating a cycle of exposure. Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn at a young age. The material that talks about drugs, wild parties, and excessive drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would typically listen to or watch. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible through guidance and supervision. Like the author said, if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves, there would not be anything left for anyone to enjoy. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of the most egregious examples. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and in other places, but just kept in sections where children don't usually go, like adult-only areas. I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from R-rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things' through community standards and parental controls. The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future of our society. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials as much as possible; it will be a better world if we do, ensuring a healthier environment for their growth.
670	3647	2	3	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive for various reasons. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves permanently. I, however, do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be removed because a few people do not agree with them or their content. First, people have vastly different views on what they find offensive based on their upbringing and beliefs. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same book or song to be removed from circulation. With people always having such different views and sensitivities, it is inherently difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed from the library or store. If one person found my favorite book offensive, I would not want it taken off the shelves completely, depriving me and others of the chance to read it. Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelf, there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left for anyone to enjoy. Author Katherine Paterson once wisely said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' She is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves, there would be no books left for anyone to read, which defeats the purpose of a library. People find different things offensive and if everyone acted on every offense, there would be nothing left for anyone. Finally, if someone finds a book offensive, they simply do not have to read it or engage with it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive, they don't need to watch it or read it; they can choose to ignore it. Instead of taking it off the shelves for everyone, the person could just not read it and select something else more to their liking. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people who enjoy or learn from them. When someone finds something offensive, they could just avoid that specific item instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offended by one of my favorite books, I would prefer if they just avoid reading it instead of taking it off the shelves so that I cannot read it anymore. Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive and would like these things to be removed from the shelves permanently. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed, as such actions can lead to a slippery slope of censorship. Taking these items off the shelves might make a few people happy, but it could also upset even more people who value access to diverse materials. Not everyone finds the same things offensive, and materials should not be taken off the shelves simply because a minority of people do not agree with them.
671	3648	2	3	Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open, its flames licking the sky. You see men walking into a library empty handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media, their faces grim with purpose. The men then toss them into the raging inferno and you see them become incinerated, the pages curling into ash, lost forever. This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people. Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple. In the @ORGANIZATION1 it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press, a cornerstone of our liberty. By tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble? As citizens of the @LOCATION1 we can not let this happen to our great nation, a nation built upon such freedoms. By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically, becoming a shallow pool. For example take @PERSON1's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @CAPS1 faith. If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information, stunting scientific progress. If this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge, from science to history. Picture @CAPS2 in the @DATE1, a time of great darkness. Hitler's @ORGANIZATION2 has taken power and are systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the @ORGANIZATION2 cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries. This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place. The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few, erasing diversity of thought. In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few. This is not what our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 envisioned @LOCATION2 to become and they were right. Letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong and must be opposed.
672	3649	2	3	Everyone has things that would offend them, whether they admit it or not, it is a simple fact of human nature. Books are known to do this to people, pushing boundaries and challenging comfortable views. However, there are all different kinds of books, music, and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of people, as tastes and sensitivities vary widely. There are even books read in school classrooms that offend people, causing debates among parents and educators. Reading is an important thing and whether or not the reader likes it, they will come across one that offends them at some point. I believe we have the right to have those offending things because there are so many books who offend people, music and movies have censorship, and if they don't like it they should ignore it. First of all, we have the right to have these kinds of books, a right protected by our freedoms. Just like in life, there are certain things people don't like, but deal with it anyway, learning from the experience. That's what this is. Even though there are the handful out there that don't like those certain books, those books are the ones that are well liked and become famous, touching many lives. I have read a book that people have wanted to ban and it was one of the best books I have read, offering a new perspective. To sum that all up, if we took away every book that one person didn't like, there would be only few left, and shelves would be barren. Secondly, music and movies have censorship systems already in place. You can choose whether you want that censorship or not, depending on your preferences. Movies tell what ages are okay to watch those movies through their rating systems. Music blocks out the words that need to be on certain radio edits. If they don't want it they don't have to listen to it or watch it; the power of choice is theirs. We all have the certain things we love and hate, we can't eliminate all of the hated things from the world. Last of all, in my opinion if they don't want it they don't have to have it; no one is forcing them. The music and movies are an option to people, they don't have to listen or watch something they think is a bad idea, they can simply move on. It's all opinionated, there isn't a right or wrong to it, just personal taste. I know of people out there who don't have @CAPS1's or they don't listen to the radio, that's perfectly fine, they have made their choice. They don't have to complain about because they don't pay any attention to it, living their lives as they see fit. To wrap this all up, there are so many books out in the world that offend people, the music and movies have censorship, and if they can't stand it they don't have to deal with it. As I said, these books, magazines, music, etc. are very well liked by many of people, so why get rid of them for those few who get offended? We all have things we do and don't like that we cannot do anything about, and that is part of living in a diverse society. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
673	3650	2	3	There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out, the quiet hum of knowledge surrounding me. It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting, its spine calling out to me. The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on, a story of struggle and resilience. The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it, a narrative that could help others. Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them, to find the stories that speak to us. Whether literature includes stories of love and heartbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves, representing the full spectrum of human experience. Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses, which is what makes discourse possible. Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides? Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading, gaining empathy and understanding. If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others to learn and grow. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world from necessary and challenging conversations. Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives, whether online or through peers. We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music, under guidance. If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not, not the library's duty to remove it. The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help, it would only create a vacuum of ignorance. In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders who know their children best. The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective way to handle sensitive content. If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public, but to provide access and let individuals choose for themselves.
674	3651	2	3	The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already, a balanced and practical system. A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is, providing a sensible approach. Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read, offering something for everyone. The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read, guiding their development. If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it, respecting the parent's authority. If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area, setting clear boundaries. Although, sometimes the child @MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice, especially in a quiet library. That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not a blanket censorship policy. The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship, making a universal standard impossible. Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate for a public space. Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever as historical treasures. Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them, finding them intimidating. Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree, leading to constant conflict. The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books, a vast collection of choices. The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others, focusing on their own interests. It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@CAPS2 I want to read that one,' they are more likely to seek out familiar stories. the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort, something they already know and love. The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books, and the library facilitates this choice. Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree, showing the divisive nature of the issue. The children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child, who seeks out engaging and age-appropriate material.
675	3652	2	3	So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks @CAPS4 across the room in disgust. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away without a word. You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana, a topic of modern debate. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf, available for those who need it. I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths and let others decide for themselves. A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone, a true public resource. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc., expanding your world for free. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave, it's a community haven. What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library, preserving the entirety of its collection. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not for more sensitive materials. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart, the soul of the place. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have, creating a unique identity for each. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf, bowing to pressure. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line, which isn't always possible. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library, a vital service. But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs, they want to
676	3653	2	3	Maybe, to a sense I do not think that books should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is because that some books, magazines and other stuff can be informative. They can help you with certain questions and provide valuable knowledge. They may not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have, offering a historical perspective. But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People might take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt emotionally. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed if they cause significant harm. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other people deeply. The sense of this nature is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine, but that is a request, not a demand. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book; it requires a broader consensus.  If you take every offensive book off the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives, losing important lessons. They maybe think it would be a good idea to take books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to teach. They might think they are doing the right thinking by not showing you sexual offensive stuff. You may not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming, aiming to protect their innocence. Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They may not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have, which can be disturbing. Certain books should stay on the shelf such as an anatomy book. Anatomy books show the human body; they do not hide the human body we should know about the human body for educational purposes. So the anatomy books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provocative stuff then go to a sex store, a more appropriate venue. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of human beings, keeping public spaces comfortable for all.  The anatomy magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment or titillation. You can go to a different store for enjoyment and entertainment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the anatomy items, which are scientifically valuable. People could get offensive by not looking like the people in the magazine, feeling insecure about their bodies. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not? Not you would not because an anatomy book is there for your learning environment not to offend you; its purpose is educational. That also could go for the sexual magazines, which have a different intent. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to younger kids that fast, risking their premature exposure? You would want to teach them about sexual intercourse not through a magazine, but through proper education. I know that anatomy books and tapes can be encouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults, who can process the information maturely.  As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people like to relax to this sort of stuff, providing a necessary escape. I mean I do not buy tapes of certain artists or music but other people do, and they have their own tastes. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up, limiting their choices? You have to think about the younger generations and their cultural needs. The older generations lived a happy not violent life, or so it is often perceived. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard, facing many challenges. They need to make a living on the street and cope with daily struggles. They need something to listen to for comfort and motivation. This offensive music is to listen to; sure some music is horrible but what music isn't these days, as standards change.  If music is what you are interested in then why would we take it off the shelves, stifling artistic expression? People make a living listening to music and creating it for others, contributing to culture. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around, connecting people. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others, which seems an overreaction. If you go back to the 1960s their music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a major problem about that then. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but it's because they grew up around it and became accustomed. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual music, it is part of our cultural landscape. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager, so you understand the need for relatable art. You know you would not be listening to a Beatles song that would not be about drugs or sex or getting high, as their music also touched on mature themes. The Beatles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now, showing that themes are cyclical.  Generations change and so does the environment but you can not change the way we grew up, as it shapes who we are. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power and understanding. The generations now are tough and they won't let down, they will resist such changes. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up with away from us, as it is a part of our identity. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours, it seems unfair. Its not something you want to take away it's something you want to look back and see how much our generations have changed from one to another, appreciating the evolution of culture and ideas over time.
677	3654	2	3	In my opinion I believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries to foster a diverse and inclusive environment. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section they don't have to read it; they can simply choose another book. Not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines should be available, but a wide array. Everyone's different meaning they have different personalities and views on what they like and find valuable. I think libraries should actually expand their variety of books to include more perspectives and subjects. Libraries that don't cater to a person's desires or interests, what would make them want to stay and engage with the resources? Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone, from science fiction to historical texts. Just like how they have an adult and children section, there can be designated areas for different content levels. Everyone has a place where they feel like they belong and can find materials that resonate with them. Even if some people get offended, that is an inevitable part of a diverse collection. A person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style; it is a subjective experience.  I do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course that should not be crossed. Nothing should get too out of line where it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic, indicating a genuine problem. You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line by the volume and consistency of feedback. Each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner, balancing honesty with consideration. In the times that I've been to the library there might be some things that I don't agree with or how certain things are presented. But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library, completely absorbed in a book I might dislike. I know when I go I always find my style of music that appeals to me, which makes the visit worthwhile. Not just the same thing everywhere I go; libraries offer unique selections. There's always a choice, different options and more things I can learn about, which is the core of a library's mission.  Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc. is a way to appeal for everyone, ensuring no one is left out. A person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like without restriction. There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for, but others might find it incredibly meaningful. If everyone told what they like and don't like about a certain book, the collection would be based on popular opinion alone. Where's the variety in that? What books will be left if we remove everything that offends someone? Everyone has their own thoughts on what they like; if there's a topic you don't like you probably know least about it, and exposure can bridge that gap. And the library is a good way to search and find information about anything, expanding one's horizons and understanding of the world, which is ultimately why such institutions are vital to a free and educated society.
678	3655	2	3	This essay is all about whether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some people, a topic of much debate. I do not believe things should be removed from shelves in libraries if they offend someone, as censorship can limit access to important ideas. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean it's offensive to all; people have different sensitivities and backgrounds. If you are offended by something they display, there are ways that you can avoid seeing them without demanding removal. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it, thus minimizing your exposure. Alternatively, you can ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need without encountering the offensive material, or try to search what you're looking for on the internet, which offers another avenue for information.  When I visit the library I already know what I'm going to get so I have never found anything offensive to me personally. If I did find something offensive to me I would complain to the staff about my concerns. And if they didn't do anything about it I would just never go back, exercising my choice as a consumer. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs and preferences. The libraries I go to always have sections separating the different age groups to help organize content. The sections are split into children, teens, and adults, making it easier to find age-appropriate materials. I've been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive, suggesting it may not be a widespread issue. If the library had something that would offend me I wouldn't know because I stick to my preferred sections. Every time I go I stay in one particular section for teens and look at magazines and books that interest me, which works well.  I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't, and it is not fair to impose one's personal standards on everyone else, thereby preserving the library's role as a repository of diverse knowledge and viewpoints for the entire community.
679	3656	2	3	I think we should not take it off the shelf because what may be offensive to you may not be offensive to me, as we all have different perspectives. Or something that is fun or I think is beneficial to me might be important for my growth or entertainment. And what may be offensive to me may not be offensive to you, highlighting our individual differences. And I think if some things are offensive to someone they should just walk off and choose not to engage with it. Or they could just don't mind it and focus on materials that they do enjoy, because personal responsibility plays a key role in navigating a shared space like a library, where a variety of content must be available to serve a diverse public with differing tastes and needs.
680	3657	2	3	I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works effectively, and should continue without major changes. While everyone may dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson rightly said, because that would leave shelves empty. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves after careful consideration. The possibility children will see the offensive material appears unlikely under the current system. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the children's books, keeping them separated. At my local library, there is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place, often labeled for mature audiences. To acquire these books you must have a parent's permission or be eighteen years of age, adding a layer of protection. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question due to these safeguards.  Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated, providing important context. For example, a classic novel may have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time, reflecting historical attitudes. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written fifty years ago because it has something offensive in it by today's standards, as societal norms evolve. While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries, such as those inciting violence. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or explicit movies on their shelves, as they are not educational. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore their collective voice. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves, weighing public sentiment against free speech. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned to maintain community standards and harmony.  Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today, with strong opinions on both sides. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job reasonably well, and that it should continue to be used. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains on most shelves uncensored, allowing for access. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned after a review process. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not automatically removed, while the ones that truly deserve
681	3658	2	3	Have you ever been at the library and asked yourself any of the following questions? Who reads this? Why is it here? Are kids reading or watching this stuff? Do kids check these out? Or have you ever wondered or said to yourself any of these statements? I don't want my kids to pick this up and read this. This is so offensive. This goes against all our morals. I don't know what kind of freak convention this is but I'm no part of it. Lets get out of here. This place is wack. Ever consider what books get banned from the library? Who bans the books? I think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves. I think that they should just stick them to a side of the library and put an age on it or you have to be a certain age to check out those books. I dont think the cussing books are that offensive. When the person (No matter who it is) goes out into the world, they are going to learn and hear curse words. People use them like they do the words 'and' or 'the'. They are going to hear them till their grave. Whether they chose to use them or not that's their choice. For them to be banned or moved to a different group of books they should have to be sexist, racist, have a lot of sex, or just really gruesome. I think they should go upstairs with the mushy romance and wacked out western. I mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area. The staircase should be by the circulation desk. When they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there. I think the top level or a certain area should be the adult area. They have mushy lovey dovey stuff, they have cow boy shoot off stuff, and the offensive stuff. The stuff with too much sex, really racist, or really sexist, or gruesome stuff like people killing people for fun. Also they should have the adult magazines up there too. Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. You know how you go down an aisle at the supermarket and there are girls in their bikini and half naked. Then there are the cosomos both should be upstairs. I mean they talk about how to give pleasurable sex. I would hate for some little eight year old or nine year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life. Then the main level or area should be teen books. You know vampire books, super heroes, crazy fiction stuff, and then the magazines and movies that aren't bad. Then the bottom level should be the children level. Games puppets and movies and easy books. That about sums that up. I dont think just anybody should be able to ban a book. I think it should be open but not just anyone. There should be a huge meeting with the mayor, a couple teachers one english teacher from each level, and parents, and the librarians. The person who wants it banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff. Like Author Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.' This is why a balanced, community-based approach is essential for managing library collections.
682	3659	2	3	Censorship in the libraries. Do you think that we should be able to take movies, magazines, and books off the shelf? There are many different arguments about this subject. I believe if they put the books, movies, and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others. They need to learn about everything that's out there in this world because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older. I think that it is critical for our youth to know about it. Some people often say that we are too young to be looking at that stuff but the younger you find out about it the better off you will be when you get older. Exposure to a wide range of ideas and topics helps build understanding and prepares them for the realities of life. Sheltering them completely can leave them unprepared. So that is my input on the situation: the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff, and that knowledge is a powerful tool for navigating the world.
683	3660	2	3	I think that certain materials should not be removed because a couple people do not like what is in a book, or movie, or in music. If we were to listen to what everyone said and remove the books that they do not like then other people would not have anything to read. For example if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it, another person that comes in the library daily might want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes. Another example is if a person has children that come into the library and their children were watching movies about gangs, drugs, and violence, the mother would want that movie removed from the library. I say that if the mother does not want her children to watch the movies they do she should say something to them and punish them every time they are caught watching it. Instead of parents trying to remove the books that many other people like they should be more disciplined with their children. A way for the library to stop children from getting movies or books they should not be reading is to put all the books and movies in a special area where it will be watched. Many people like movies with drugs, and violence. Their type of movies or books should not be removed because of what another person thinks about that certain thing. I also think that if a person does not like the type of language or images in a book or movie then they should not read it or watch it. And if they say their children watch it or read it without their permission then that is their fault and they should know more about what their young children are doing instead of trying to get that book or movie removed. Sometimes books and movies have very offensive language but that is because they are just trying to show some of the stuff that happens in the real world; they want the movie or book to be as real as possible, and that realism has value for many readers and viewers.
684	3661	2	3	Censorship; the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye. Is this the right thing to do? Should society as a whole take away variety? Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have? I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or inappropriate for certain ages can be controlled. Movie theatres, video stores, and television all do it. They use ratings and age control for their viewers. Now control can be difficult, and may not always work if not handled correctly. To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaurants or bars use; such as, checking identification before letting a book that is 'R' rated or above be checked out. Different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups. Now you might be thinking; doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us? Well you might be right, but would you rather have our children see violence and other inappropriate materials that they shouldn't? It would be just like the movie theatre. You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomenal compared to what it is. Would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a magazine with cursing in it? Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon? I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age appropriate. Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that? Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers for their library are students. This being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material. Yes, media is everywhere. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should. Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay? Does it make is right for children to see and want all they want to? No, it does not. Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire. Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropriate material? Would you like to set your children up to fail? I know I wouldn't so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with? I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sakes. With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library are underrated, and that needs to be handled and controlled through sensible, age-based access systems.
685	3662	2	3	Everyone has a favorite book. And some of us can't put it down once we read the first sentence. Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it. Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see? We're all trying to accommodate to everyone and their needs just to please them. Whatever they ask is done because we don't want a big scene. A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive! Take it down! Disgusting!'. But why? Everyone has a right to read what they want to read. No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate. Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not? Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel. That excuse is ridiculous. A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the 'my child will become a rebel if they read this!' excuse, then they're not confident in their childs capability, or the fact that they taught their child well. Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author. How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library? Probably angry or upset. Authors have the right to write whatever they want. If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it. If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do? Go right ahead. No one can stop great books from being made and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it. If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that. Parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of the world. By having this desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'. This is just ridiculous. Controlling a childs life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older. Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch. Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem. Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today? No one knows. Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themself as well. Movies are almost just as harmless, limits are needed, but overall? There should be no problem. Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion. Allowing that music, or movie, or book to be made, and then take it away is ridiculous. If it offends someone, then that person should just forget it, instead of taking it away from the people who love it and the person who made it, preserving the diversity of thought and expression for all.
686	3663	2	3	I don't think there should be any censorship; good books and music shouldn't be removed just because one person finds them offensive. Because the opinions of one person may be different from another's, it is unfair to impose a single standard. I believe music is censored the most because not many people get offended by books, but censorship in music, I think, is destroying it. Because it's an artist's way of expression, and if people don't want to listen to what they are saying, then they should just not listen to it. Books, I think, shouldn't be taken offensively for the same reason music shouldn't; it's a writer's opinion and expression. It's like telling someone they can't voice their opinion on anything, like racism, or use curse words if they want to. Artistic freedom is essential for a vibrant culture, and silencing one voice sets a dangerous precedent for silencing all. Ultimately, the choice to engage with challenging material should rest with the individual, not with a censor.
687	3664	2	3	To the Library Association Board: I am writing to you today concerning censorship in libraries. I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some people seem offensive and to others not at all. However, I do have my own viewpoint on the situation, and I feel that it is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do. With the world the way it is now, violence can erupt from the simplest of things. Putting books on public shelves for the public to read can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions. Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result, creating unnecessary conflict. My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books. This will create a safe and happy environment for all who visit public libraries and other public places. It will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents' behaviors. Children follow in their parents' footsteps. Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this position. When our children grow up, we want them to behave in a responsible way. Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior and mutual respect. As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are respectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other. I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in. Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that. Without offensive books for the public to read, we will create a better environment for the people living today.
688	3665	2	3	Removal of Books If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken off shelves? No, even though people may find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves. When I was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A Wrinkle in Time'. I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help; the privilege to read the book had been taken away. The book was no longer allowed in elementary schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the school library. For me to do as my teacher asked I had to go to a public library and get the book, which was an unnecessary obstacle to my education. If you find a book offensive keep it to yourself and don't read the book; they shouldn't be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others may like them. I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want; books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taken away then very few books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published, enriching our collective knowledge. The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, etc.; they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. It is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reviewing, etc.; even the things people may find offensive, they might teach valuable lessons about life and history.
689	3666	2	3	Going to the library you would think of it as a family environment, wouldn't you? I know that when I think of the library I do not think of offensive material that would make anyone upset. Surprisingly many of the libraries do carry such items, and I do not think that they should be allowed to, since it is not aimed just for adults. Children love to go to the library to check out books and many more things that they enjoy, but a five year old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter discriminating against the other gender or another race. These materials should not be able to sit upon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down. The writers or the library owners wouldn't let their own children read it so why should it be okay for someone else's child to read or watch it. I'm not the only one who thinks this; I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appreciate their loved ones finding these things and reading them. The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life; who knows what they will do or think when they are old enough. These places are supposed to be a family place where you can go to get information, not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racism, and any other derogatory subjects. Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading this corrupted material; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account, potentially being influenced negatively. I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches; not only because small children could see them, but adults do not need to be reading, listening, or watching these things either. If you would not want your child to, why would anyone else want their child to? Protecting our community's values begins with curating a respectful and safe space for everyone.
690	3667	2	3	Why should they take them off the shelves? If you ask me I think they should leave the materials up there. I think they should leave them up there. Not only is this happening in the libraries, it's happening on televisions also. Everything in the library might not offend some people. Some people take things offensive when they see something that's against their religion, culture, or maybe their country. But we have the people that take certain things in the library offensive but don't worry about other content. I say, 'If you check out the library and find something that you take offensive, don't get upset just because you don't like it; doesn't mean other people won't like it. So why waste time trying to fight to get it off the shelves when it's really you the only person worried about it?' It just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them. Like someone said, a pastor was on tv, talking about how bad hell really is since some people don't think it's not going to be all that bad. He was on tv at the time and this lady got offensive about it and had them take him off tv. But she didn't have to watch him on tv; she could have watched something else. Nobody made her watch it; she chose to watch it. So what I'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Remember that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use it rather than thinking about just you and your personal sensibilities.
691	3668	2	3	Libraries are great for multiple reasons. A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tutor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight. However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get. Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have. Personally, I think that censorship can just be more inconvenient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's. However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's because it is seen as an 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn't let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren't going to let me proceed with my research. I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themselves to avoid it. Rather than just getting rid of it all together. The same goes for any form of media. If there is a T.V. show that you don't like, don't watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don't listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is okay and not okay for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidelines, are set and the child understands what they are. In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information. Any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries shouldn't have to feel responsible for censoring items that may be offensive. It is their job to just offer information.
692	3669	2	3	I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's. Katherine is correct in many ways. We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones they disliked. The world would lose a lot of information on important things in their worlds. I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored. I don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways like a book about glorifying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women. Now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book, because they see how wrong @CAPS7 is. Music is freedom of speech, some artist's see themselves as 'liberators', 'idols', and even 'love spreading', yes their are some songs that could be 'seem' offensive but you'll never know how high a @CAPS3 will grow if u cut @CAPS7 down. In example the song titled '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6, @CAPS7 has catholic churches furious because they automatically assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone. People learn special, powerful life lessons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @CAPS7 will probably always remain that way, we don't know. But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future by allowing access to all materials.
693	3670	2	3	Libraries are places that you can get a book you should be allowed to pick. So also you are one person, you have every right to get any book you want. I believe that there should not be a way to stop people from reading. So I believe that the system should stop blocking us by taking the books off the shelf, as this limits our freedom to learn and explore different ideas and stories that are important to us.
694	3671	2	3	Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he is was finally found and killed. If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or wasn't around when it happened. If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone found a movie that was racist then don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while. For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else. Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them. The only thing they have are some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might pique your interest. Books might have some things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it. If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that i would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy. Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that. Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard somethings about it. In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers. I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do well at all and simply limits choices for everyone else.
695	3672	2	3	There are so many things these days that people find offending, in so many different places in magazines, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet, even some words in songs. Some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self. A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this? I dont want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood? Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them to these places where it is at? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be associated with. Also if everyone took things off the self what they found inappropriate then we wouldn't have anything left to read, listen to, or watch. A lot of times one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end. For example @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same thing extremely offending. It would lead to many arguments among our communities. Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well, and would not be a good idea. If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is an easy world. This world is harsh and not easy at all times. Kids learn a lot of this through the media. As long as we have positive role models to explain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed? If people were able to do this then the communities would have a lot more crime from anger, we would have nothing left to read watch or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to expect from the media. So now i ask you, what do you think about the importance of preserving access to all materials.
696	3673	2	3	At my point of view, I think if materials such as books are offensive to the reader, the reader should just leave the book alone. Because other readers might just want to read it. The same principle applies to music, movies, and magazines, or anything else; just because you find something offensive, it wouldn't be right to take it away from thousands or more people who might appreciate it. Also, I think if something is offensive to more than one person, it should not just be taken away right then and there. We as people should step up and have a vote or talk about the problem to reach a fair decision. I think it just wouldn't be right for us or for the rest of the world, and we should also look at how much work the author had to put in. I never wrote a book, but I also know it's not easy to do. Here's an example: me and my family wanted to go out to eat, but we didn't know where to eat at. So everybody was thinking about pizza, but my big brother didn't want to, so we didn't go out to eat that night because of one person who didn't want to. That's not fair now, is it? So in my conclusion, I don't think it would be right to take something away just because somebody found it offensive; you just have to look at the rest of the world and consider what is right for everyone else.
697	3674	2	3	The content of a library should be full of various material even if one person finds certain materials offensive. Just because someone might think a material is offensive, does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgetting it altogether? Some subjects can be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ignore them. One subject that can be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases. You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, too uncomfortable to be seen in the area. It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it for their own health and knowledge. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware of, even if you think it doesn't affect you directly. Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history. Some history can be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forget about them. The Holocaust, for example, was a very dark period in history. Over six million people died because just one person didn't like what they believed in. It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is. We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening again. People's likes in music vary greatly. There are so many different types and styles of music. Some music might be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library? The library should always have a large variety of different music to cater to diverse tastes. Often people would like to widen their music intellect, and the library is the perfect place to do that by exploring new genres. Everyone is different; we never all like the same thing. Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information elsewhere. If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library, they would most likely find another way to get that information, perhaps from less reliable sources. Having a variety in books, music, movies, and magazines is what makes the library what it is: a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.
698	3675	2	3	You're watching a movie on TV that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the TV skips over that part because people think that scene is inappropriate. Censorship is good for protecting audiences, but sometimes it is too strict when it comes to movies, music, and books, altering the original artistic vision. Some of the movies that are popular will end up on TV for the viewers' entertainment, but some movies have scenes that are a little inappropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the TV companies will cut that scene out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say, which can disrupt the flow and meaning. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love by creating a fragmented viewing experience. The TV companies even censor historical movies, which is particularly problematic. If it's a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story and the historical accuracy that the filmmakers intended to portray. Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange and interrupts the musical rhythm. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it, placing the responsibility on broadcasters. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids; if the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music and should monitor their media consumption. Books tend to be censored and even banned at schools, which limits educational opportunities. Not too many children read books anymore, so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want because reading helps the mind develop. Some schools ban books because of inappropriate language, which is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of a few words. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime, even when those details are crucial to the plot or theme. Some books are just too good to be banned and offer valuable perspectives. A lot of things seem to be censored in this world. We should have some level of censorship to protect the very young, but it shouldn't be so strict when it comes to movies, music, and books intended for general audiences.
699	3676	2	3	The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing for entertainment. Although some materials that people need to research at the library might be considered inappropriate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others who require that information for legitimate purposes. This could include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for a school project, or looking for a certain type of book to read for personal growth. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow and hindering their access to knowledge. At many schools, students are asked to write research papers on a wide array of topics. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper might include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student might choose to write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual, for instance. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports drug use; it is merely an academic inquiry. Some adults might say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it might include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose, not for entertainment. My freshman year we read classic literature and watched the film adaptations to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity, which are elements true to the story. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate for younger audiences. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then and provided valuable historical context. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scenes and see the movie for what it really was: an educational tool. If this movie was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it in a realistic way. Sometimes, we just want a good book to read for enjoyment. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material that resonates with their experiences. Many books in this section might include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children, but are relevant for teenagers. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read, which is a concerning trend. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and might even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives by seeing characters overcome similar challenges. If libraries start censoring books we might end up with less and less readers as the years go on, defeating the purpose of a library. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books by allowing parents to make choices for their children. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material and guide their selections. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them, which is a reasonable compromise. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library and limiting their reach. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains to suit their own needs and interests.
700	3677	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries, which some may find inappropriate and some that are not. But libraries exist to help us learn about many things, such as reading for fun, reading the newsletter, or just looking for random information to satisfy our curiosity. Libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments, or learn about animals or anything else that piques our interest. We need all books because they teach us the past, they all have a purpose, and we become more intelligent by engaging with diverse ideas. I believe that all books in a library have a purpose, even if they might be offensive to some. They might be offensive but they teach us many valuable lessons that we can't learn elsewhere. For example, there are books out there that talk about difficult historical events. For some people this might be a touchy subject and some might take it offensively, but if we didn't have those books to learn from we would make the same mistakes as we did back then, failing to learn from history. Books can teach us so much about the past; we can learn so many things from books then anywhere else in the world because they preserve knowledge. I also think that all books have a purpose to them, whether they are fiction or nonfiction. You might ask 'how do fiction books have purpose?' Well, fiction books have a purpose because they teach us to really use our imagination and think creatively. Quite a bit of books make us realize that the struggles of a character can be the same struggles of someone in real life, fostering empathy. And the most important reason is because fiction books not only catch our attention, but they also catch our children's attention, making reading enjoyable. Fiction books are often the first books children know how to read; this is where they start their reading skills and develop a lifelong love of reading. My last reason for why I don't think 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from shelves is because all books make us more intelligent by exposing us to new vocabulary and concepts. We learn so much information from all sorts of books, both factual and imaginative. Another example would be, that medical textbooks could be considered 'offensive' as they contain graphic images, but if we didn't have them we would not have intelligent doctors who are properly trained. My final reason why I disagree with books being removed if they aren't suited for everyone is that someone that wants to learn something wouldn't be able to because what they want to learn could be offensive to others, restricting their intellectual freedom. What I mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think it's offensive, which is not fair. Every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not, and that is a natural part of life. But why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc from shelves based on one perspective? Just because we don't like it doesn't mean we have to remove it for everyone else. Everyone has different taste; we won't ever agree on anything completely. But removing books from shelves isn't fair to anyone who might benefit from them. Yes, they might be unsuited for others but when we don't like some thing, don't we just move along to something we do like? Yes we do, so we should do the same thing with books and allow others the same choice.
701	3678	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Here are statements on why I believe this. First, I think if you are reading, listening, or watching any of these things then don't read the part that is offensive to you. If you believe that it is offensive to you then why are you reading it? If you believe this is offending you then put it down and forget about it, you don't have to read or watch it. I think if you are reading or watching it, then it is at your own fault if you are offended by it. Personal responsibility is key here; you have the choice to simply stop engaging with the content. When does anyone even write about offending things lately anyway? Like I said before if you are reading or watching or whatever it is then it is your own fault. Some people state that when one of you states you have been offended you just get rid of that thing and tear it away from our lives. Well it stops today I am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other peoples lives by getting rid of what other people like to do. If you believe that you should take away our fun and pleasure of doing these things, then do it, but remember what you're taking away from those who like to read all of that. If you get rid of the books that keep us entertained then there will be nothing left on the shelves for any of us. The shelves would be bare, offering no choice or variety for anyone. I have written in this newspaper of things that should be left alone. I have also written about if you do take away our simple things we like to read, just think about your taking away from those who read, listen or watch these things. Take in order of what I have said, goodnight.
702	3679	2	3	I would like to start off this story by stating I don't believe that libraries should remove books if they are offensive. If a book is offensive that's not a reason to take it off the shelves; we watch movies in school today showing the past when America had slaves. I myself don't believe it is fair to show a movie in school about slavery but we can't have a book that doesn't actually show anything to us, it just tells us what's going on. In my eyes a book is less harmless than watching a show on the subject. A movie can show a lot more detail in it then a book can, with visuals and sounds that are more intense, so I say let the books stay where they are. Don't try to shut down an author because you don't like what they wrote; there might be more meaning in the book then you can see. Just keep reading you never know how the story might go on. Just like don't judge a book by its cover. We shouldn't take away a book someone might like. Someone might hate the book but because they hate it would you quit reading it? I don't believe it is right to remove something because someone might not like what it is saying. I myself see a lot of things I don't like everyday but I do not try getting everything changed. This is life as I know it; there are a lot of offensive people in this world and it won't change anytime soon, not for me or anyone. Unless they make a law against being offensive. I can see someone in a band saying something offensive about someone but we can't not sell his CDs because someone might like what he said in that song. Or I don't like a lot of shows and or movies on TV but I don't try to get the station shut down; I just change the channel. As should, let's say, someone in a book store sees an offensive book; they should just look away. Not go and try to get it shut down. All I can really say though is that I couldn't tell you what I would do because I don't read very many books so I don't see them being offensive. So I can not tell you I wouldn't be mad but I still would just put the book down and not touch it again, and that should be the end of it.
703	3680	2	3	I will be talking about whether books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to some people. Because not all people have the same interests or the same sensitivities. First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item, say like an explicit song, they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't like the explicit song would get offended and would want it off the shelves. Another example can be a book. What if a person didn't like what he or she read and gets offended? They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he or she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend, sharing their enjoyment. The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertisement? A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it; it shouldn't stop selling for that particular person. One person's dislike should not dictate availability for everyone else. In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. They shouldn't have looked at the item in the first place if they were so sensitive to its content.
704	3681	2	3	Books are books; we all read them and summaries over them. To find what we need to know in the past or future or mainly what's going on in today's life. So we shouldn't take books off the shelves, just like magazines. They might have information to tell people around the world. That's why people make books and magazines so people like us can read them while we're not busy in life or just relaxing. People read bad stuff all the time in books or magazines; that's what life is about because there's some good stuff and there are some bad stuff to read about in life. I mean, hey, if you don't want your children reading them then have them not read at all. Because the more they age the more they're going to know what's going on in life. There's stuff that's bad, like you can't really stop them when they're at that age in their life, so they're going to find out some how or another. Cause there are schools that have a lot of reading to talk about good stuff that might be important for their futures. Schools are mainly why kids know what they know now because you got all your history classes that talk about slavery and everything else that's bad. When kids say it out of class rooms they get in trouble. So if they get in trouble out of class then why would you teach it or even say it? History classes are very helpful because they teach you about all the different wars that have happened and who invaded other countries or states. They help out on finding places on maps that show all the world's states and countries and even where we live in our country. So really why would you take stuff off the shelves if other people read them? Mainly why would you do it since other people have worked very hard and their time making books, then have them published for you to just take them off the shelf? What if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff in a little writing? What's the harm in it anyway when you can simply choose not to read it.
705	3682	2	3	For as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons. Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. Though it may be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. It is a right to be able to obtain the information these materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship. Some may argue that certain material may be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels? Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want their feelings or knowledge portrayed. The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech. It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason, to inform and to document. Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution? Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material. There are some rare situations when restrictions may need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or disturbing content unsuitable for children. This way information is never censored completely from society. It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorship of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions may be an answer for younger citizens, these materials aren't taken away from the public. Whatever it may be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems.
706	3683	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book. Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you. Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it. the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are. People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or music. The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive. The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. Its your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others.
707	3684	2	3	Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you? What are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian? Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears? Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you. I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive. That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong I would say. So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies. Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not. So to wrap this all up nice and sweet. Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also. That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read. If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children.
708	3685	2	3	I think that a library should be just books because that what they are made for. If we started putting movies in the librarys why put books in the libraries. I think it should be one or the other. If movies were in libraries i think that people would get more movies than books, and just think how it would be if you put music in a library also. I do think that a magazine is a book. Movies should stay in a movie store of at the movie theater. not in libraries. Music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries. People would lose intrest in books if people started putting movies and music in libraries. I think they are trying to put technology in libraries and im not for that. If music and movies were at libraries their would be no need for books and people would stop buying books. We need books they are the oldest but most acreart way to express yourself or tell a story. but now they want movies or music.
709	3686	2	3	The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship. Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing? I am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good. The first thing I am going to talk to you about is how it is bad. The bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily. Most people can handle alot of abuse, but on the otherhand alot of people can't. In my oppinion I think that it is fine to have some things out that offend people because that is how alot of people find humor. Such as political cartoon. They make fun of the president and alot of the other people that are in office, but you dont see them complaining about it. In my oppinion if you dont like it then dont read it. That is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again. But on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended. Because some of the things are very mean in books and movies. I think that there should be some type of line that seperates going to fare and what is good enough. most people can live with it, but others can't. Such as violence, there is a whole lot of violence in the world, and expecally in this time period. where ever you go there is always some sort of violence. In conclusion I think that people need to get together and create a line that can be drawn befor they get to far. and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves, but not everything.
710	3687	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. We all know whats wrong, and what's right. Every school is different. Some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like a children's picture book, then that's gonna be inappropriate. If you're sixteen and reading a Stephen King book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, 'Green Eggs and Ham' by Dr. Seuss. Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading 'Goosebumps'. Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it. Don't we all agree that music is life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. I say who cares? Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about God, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it. Everyone is different, no one is the same. Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned. Movies, movies, movies! Video games, video games, video games! We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. Movies have ratings like video games do. Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. Adults would most likely be playing a rated M game, and watching rated R movies. Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated E games, and watching rated G movies. As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. Rated R movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned. In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. It just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. We should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves. No one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth. Then material should be suppervised by my parents.
711	3688	2	3	Censorship in libraries? That could be a good and a bad thing. Is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books? Will authors remove their books from libraries? Censorship in Libraries is not as needed as most people think. Children now a days know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects, often more than adults give them credit for. I understand parents dont want their children to read books containing drugs, violence, sex, etc. Their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though, whether through school, friends, or personal experience. They might as well get ahead start on it now in a controlled, educational environment. Young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway, preferring instead stories and picture books. If you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they might need those kinds of books for. Say I needed a book on 'violence' for a project im doing in history class. If the books are censored then I would have no sources to get information from, which would hinder my education and understanding of complex topics.  On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored. No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school. If I was a parent I would be concerned myself about what my child is being exposed to. If it's that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t.v., like in news reports or dramatic shows. Commercials about condoms, and advertisements telling them to use drugs/alcohol are prevalent. Atleast with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you, providing context and consequences.  If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors the idea to do the same. Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody, defeating the purpose of a library entirely. Books are a key to learning! We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are, because they all hold some form of knowledge or perspective. Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them, providing guidance instead of outright bans. Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but thats what children do when their immature and curious. You have to expect that from kids now a days as they learn to navigate the world. No matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn about the full spectrum of human experience.
712	3689	2	3	NO, I do not think that books, music, magizines and etc. should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Books help people in many ways, providing escape and education. Music helps people find their activity in many ways, inspiring movement and emotion. Also magizines helps people do things thats meant to be done, from cooking to decorating. The reason I said books help people is because it furthers one knowledge to understand things better, from complex theories to simple life lessons. It also hepls one vocabulary more stronger than it once was, introducing new words and phrases. Last but not least it helps people become more focused and when saying that I mean that it makes you understand how to be focused on the main idea and the whole concept of the book. When people read and they don't understand what they are reading, they look further to try and understand the words they misunderstood which is good because you will learn alot more then you thought you did, building research and comprehension skills.  Music is also a very good thing to use because it make people calm when they have had an long stressful day at work, school, doctor, or etc., offering a mental break. Music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to paint, expressing themselves in new ways. When im tired and I have had a long day , I like to go home and lay down and listen to music and that is because I feel relaxed and more calmer, able to unwind and decompress.  Last but not least, magizines. Magizines gives you alot of information that one might be seeking for, on topics from current events to hobbies. Just say that you were looking for a recipe and you don't have an computer and you have magizines, you can look and a magizine and see when was this recipe effective and by whom it was wrote, providing practical knowledge. Also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes, clothes, perfume fragrances, lotions and some even order house hold things if needed, they offer a convenient catalogue. When I look in a magizine,I like to order shoes or even just compare the prices of something store bought or the magizine price, helping me make informed decisions. There are many different things you can look foward to when looking in a magizine, from advice columns to celebrity news. So take my advive and try it because sometimes what your'e looking for can be right in your library, easily accessible and free.  With all that being sad books, music, and magizines can be very helpful to you and any body else, providing resources for many aspects of life. Books are very helpful when it comes to essays or etc., offering citations and deep dives into subjects. Music is very useful when youv'e had a long day at your place of buisness or etc., serving as a therapeutic tool. Magizines are very self explanatory when it comes to food, clothing, shoes, topics , essays ,cars ,houses or etc., presenting information in a digestible format. When you have a question or a concern or maybe even a doubt you can go to your nearest own personal library and borrow or read a book, magizine or listen to a little music, finding answers and solace. All these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you, enriching your life. All of these things can help you in a way that is unique and personal to your needs.
713	3690	2	3	There are people that are offensive to all kinds of people, often without intending to be. So what will make it different if someone writes a book that someone else doesn't like it should not matter if someone does not agree with someone else desion on a book cause someone else might like his or her book, finding value in its message. There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc that someone will not like that is just part of life it you ask me, as tastes and sensitivities vary widely. So i think haveing books that some people dont like is a great thing to have in are world, as it encourages diversity of thought. It tell you whether people are going out to see what is going on in are world if people are really caring about what other people write or say to other people, reflecting the state of society. There is just one thing that people should allows keep in mind when they are write a movie or even in your local new paper the articles that some people put in the movies and papers are taking a little to far sometimes by what people say, potentially causing unnecessary harm. I do bevlive that there should be a line as to what you can and not write in a book and i think that should be deminded by the write of his best judgement, considering ethics and responsibility.  Why do some people complane about everything that is meant to be told to them is because they know that what he or she is saying is very true and they dont want other people to know there past if it is bad or of sumthing tragic has happend top them whether it be in ther family something bad happend to them but i think if somebody would talk to this person they would not get so mad at someone for speeching the truth to the public, fostering dialogue instead of anger. Well you have heard my side of the store on what i think about peoplle getting mad at other people for what they say and i belive that what you say is very true that we do ahve a freddom in this country to express ourselves, a right that should be protected even when it is challenging.
714	3691	2	3	Censorship seems like a great idea at first thought, offering a simple solution to a complex problem! It allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them, providing a false sense of security. Consequently, censorship in libraries creates the possibilty for every book ever written to be removed from shelves around the world, as almost any text could be deemed offensive by someone. There are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship, from its subjectivity to its restrictive nature. It creates objections due to differences in opinions and autors being completely and uterly offended by the removal of their creative work. Censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries, which are meant to be bastions of free information.  People have different criteria when it comes to deciding a level of offensiveness, shaped by their upbringing and experiences. For intsense, if a fifty-year-old conservative female read a violent book with some curse words and sexual content she might think that it was offensive and inappropriate. Likewise, if a twenty-one-year-old, careless male read the exact same book he would probably enjoy its content and find it entertaining. This defference in opinion poses as a huge problem in allowing libraries to censor their selecion, as there is no universal standard. I feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy and learn from, simply because others disapprove.  Instead of completely banning some texts, why not move them to another section of the library, making them less accessible to young children but still available? Libraries could take some time to separate the books into categories and the books that they feel are offensive could go into a separate section of the library, perhaps with a clear label. This section could be as simple a separate shelf, or could go to the extreme of a separate room or area closed in by a curtain, requiring permission to enter. Either way, completely getting rid of books because of their content is a terrible idea that limits access to knowledge and art.  Authors could potentially lose money from the action of censorship, impacting their livelihood. They put in numberous hours and a lot of effort to write books and novels, dedicating themselves to their craft. Some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces, revising and editing tirelessly. Magazines and movies provide the same amount of time, but they also aquire an unimagineable amount of money from investors and advertisers. If these authors, directors, and producers have their specific product taken off of the shelves it would be offensive to them, a rejection of their hard work and vision. They could have a decrease in sales which would cause a decrease in money as well, making it harder to create future works. The idea is simply unfair to the creators who contribute to our culture.  Librarians have the right to display the content of which they choose, using their professional judgment to curate a diverse collection, but making them remove products that they feel are fine is ridiculous and undermines their expertise. I think that censorship is a terrible idea that does more harm than good in a free society. If anything should be banned from a library it should be censorship itself, allowing ideas to flow freely for all who seek them.
715	3692	2	3	Have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories? Everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right, shaped by their unique life experiences. It is alright to have different beleifs but that shouldnt mean people shouldnt seek to understand others, to learn from differing viewpoints. I beleive that the censorship in libraries is very important but that people need to seek to understand each other more, not be so stubborn, and look at different perspectives so that people can get along easier and build a more harmonious community.  Many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others, often based on community standards. Many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories that challenge the status quo. People have the right to speech so they should be able to show others what they beleive, but they need to make sure that showing what they know is not hurting anyone else, balancing expression with empathy. Explicit movies and music are very bad with seeking to understand, often prioritizing shock value over meaningful dialogue. They are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others, sometimes perpetuating stereotypes or misinformation.  Many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way, misinterpreting intent or message. People have trouble looking at things in different perspectives and because of it they can cause trouble, leading to unnecessary conflicts. If people would seek to understand more, then the conflicts of different beleifs would not be as common, and resolution would be easier to find. When people have different perspectives, they can be more knowledgable of various opionions, enriching their own worldview and fostering tolerance.  Some people are just stubborn, refusing to consider anything outside of their own frame of reference. They choose to only beleive their ideas and refuse to listen to anyone else's, closing themselves off to growth. Being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand, creating barriers instead of bridges. If people were less stubborn, they could see more perspectives and become more aware of how others felt, developing greater compassion. When people are stubborn, it can be very hard for others to deal with or for them to get along well with others, leading to isolation and frustration.  In conlusion I do think censorship is important for protecting vulnerable audiences from genuinely harmful material, but I think that the reasons why we censor things are equally important as well, requiring careful thought. If people were more understanding of others, then we could have more censorship for the things that agrivate other people with malicious intent. We would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread there ideas in good faith, encouraging open discourse. If people sought to understand, looked for different perspectives, and were not so stubborn, then they would get along much better, creating a library environment and a society that values both safety and intellectual freedom.
716	3693	2	3	I understand how some people get offended by some things they watch or they might read, but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it. It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not. I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with some kind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, there is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that there might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie. Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book may be inappropriate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it. If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelves I wouldn't. I say this because most of the time things have been rated or in some way approved to be put on general store shelves. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing it. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelves I would be upset about it because it probably wouldn't even offend me at all. So no, I completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by its content.
717	3694	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the young adult or teen section, easy children or picture book and adult sections. The young adult or the teen section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen would normally read. The teen section has music which teens listen to. For example, they have the Twilight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language. The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the selection of books offered to them. It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed. There is also a children's section called the easy or picture book section. This section is for the younger children, children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music and movies in this section are about cartoons and animals, things that children would like to read, listen or watch. For example, this section has movies like Strawberry Shortcake, Arthur, even Lilo and Stitch. Everything in this section is made for children; there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent would think is offensive. The library has a section for adults. The adult section is there to catch adults' eyes. It is separate from the teen and children's sections, located at the other end of the library. If there is an adult who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in their section. The library keeps the adult section with things that adults would want to look for; it would not have something little children would want. The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I don't think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution with the censorship of their books, movies, music etc., ensuring everything is appropriately placed.
718	3695	2	3	When people think of libraries they picture this cold place with an old mad lady telling you to be quiet, or they just picture books everywhere. But libraries today have become way more improved and advanced with music, movies, and etc. When I was young I never really liked libraries because they seemed boring to me. That's why I wasn't a good reader either until I was in the sixth grade because I discovered the library was actually a cool place. They have different things to do like look up books, music, or movies you can check out from the libraries, or sometimes you might have magazines you can check out too. Then at the libraries there are people who don't like it because of the music, movies, and etc. This reason is because they are used to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens. That's why the faithful ones who go to the libraries everyday take offense to the new things in the library. When it all boils down, this topic makes me think about To Kill a Mockingbird because it was an offensive book talking about how the whites treated the negroes back then. The reason I say that is because the old traditions in the library are like the whites in the story and the new things in the library are like the negroes who were outcasted by the whites. Then in the book it took one little girl to settle the difference and know what's right and wrong. That's why I think instead of banning or removing stuff we should have a discussion where we can come to an agreement to keep new ideas in the libraries. When we do keep the ideas, maybe we can make a specific section for those new ideas so the people who come to the library wouldn't get offended, finding a balance that respects all patrons.
719	3696	2	3	Everywhere one goes, something is being kept from them. It is either to keep them safe, pure, or happy. In the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons; not only is it a punishment for them, but it is also to keep them away from other people. This is much like how our libraries are becoming, where books that have questionable content are being thrown out. I do not believe that this should be done. Books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own. People should be able to choose what they read, and if it offends them they can choose by themselves to stop reading that book. Many times I have learned new things from books that may not have been appropriate for my age, but it taught me a valuable lesson. For example, I read a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations; she became pregnant and it ruined her life. From this, at the age of ten years old, I learned that I do not want that to happen to me, so I am abstaining from adult relations until I am married. Of course the libraries should be separated into different categories such as: children, young adult, teen, adult, and choose at your own risk. Also, the same with magazines and music. That way, a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there. This is much like the movie ratings; a mother can pick up a movie and see that it is rated PG and know that it is acceptable for her nine-year old to watch, except possibly save for a few curse words, but a child hears that in their everyday life anyways, whether the parent knows it or not. In conclusion, I believe that literature should not be censored from the people. However, it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for. People have the right to choose what books they read and what they learn about, and everyone can learn a valuable lesson from any book; it just depends on how they interpret it.
720	3697	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. The main reason I say that is because there are not just positive things in this world, but there are a lot of negatives also. It is very important for children to learn and understand the things that are going on in the world they live in regardless if they are good or bad. Everyone is going to have to learn about the things going on around them sooner or later, so it is better to find it out as a child rather than later on in life when you might not have someone there to explain it all to you. I understand there are some age limits that should be enforced because of some of the foul nature of them. Though at some point and time before a child becomes an adult they should know most of the basics of life no matter how positive or negative. Children should not be sheltered at a young age to just young adult things because they need to know what else is out there in the world. For example, children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world. If they don't understand that, something bad could happen to them because they did not know the dangers around them since they never learned it. When I was younger it was required to know other people outside of your race or religion because not just your race or religion is in this world. Also we learned the difference between good and bad choices. If us children did not learn that at an early age many of them would be in some very rough situations today. On the other hand there is an extent the children need to learn also. For example, say you buy a video game for your child, but make sure you enforce to them that killing and shooting is not something that they should be doing out in the real world. Make sure you teach them the difference between reality and fakeness. That is a main reason why kids today do not have self control because of the things they learn off of video games. Now a days on television there are people being pressured by the media to act out of their character just to get attention. They are publicizing sexual and inappropriate things for a child to be learning about at a young age, but they need to be aware that it's out there and it is bad. In magazines they will distort famous peoples' bodies to make them look like something they are not to make people feel like they are not good enough. Children should be taught that not everything they see, hear, and read is always right or true. With today's media and materials it is easy to know the difference between right and wrong, but they put it out there as if one person is doing it, it is ok for everyone to be doing it. In most cases it is not until that person understands all of the facts about it that they can make rational decisions on their own and on their own time. Children now a days will get pressured by media, magazines, and sometimes by peers. The media is telling them to do something that is not necessarily right, but is popular. You should not teach your children off of things like that; it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on. With today's magazines, the writers will make people look like something they really are not just to make them look good. That is not fair to the readers, the person that is being exposed, or the author themself. Finally, with peer pressure today kids will see something off of television and try it then try and get their friends to do it even though they know it is not the right thing to do. I believe that children, when they are faced with dilemmas like these, should know right from wrong with the trouble they are facing. If they know nothing about it they need to walk away or learn how to say no regardless of how hard it might be. In conclusion, I believe that the children now a days that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it. Also they should know the right ways to handle it when they are put in certain situations. Lastly, I believe kids should know what is going on around them so when they grow up they know how to fend for themselves, and not be counting on someone else to tell them basic things that are going on in the world around them.
721	3698	2	3	In today's world, there are many rap/hip-hop artists. They all sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. This type of content is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. There are children that know the words to a lot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not, as some are more vigilant than others. I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things I listed above. I don't think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things. How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are? Or what alcohol is? I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age. In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even choose a different genre that doesn't use those such topics as much. Country music for example is very peaceful to me. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listen to. I will sometimes listen to rap music but I would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version. Magazines also have a lot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days. Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someone's attention. It works most of the time and children also see that. They are young and naive so they will do what they see someone else do. That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them. Another subject is the movies that are coming out in today's world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally the movies that are inappropriate for children are rated R, but children will find a way to see this stuff. A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally. These are my strong opinions on what we should do with today's society. We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching. I know that we can't watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch. Thank you for your time!
722	3699	2	3	My views on censorship are clear; I don't believe in any type of censorship. Books, music, and movies should not be censored. When it comes to children, it should be the parent's responsibility to choose what they feel children should and shouldn't read, watch, or listen to. Taking books, movies, and music off shelves isn't fair to those who want to read, watch, or listen to them or to the authors, directors, or musicians who created them. People should have the freedom to write whatever they want; the reader doesn't have to agree or enjoy the things the author is saying, but it is his freedom to say it. This principle of free expression is fundamental to a creative and open society where ideas can be shared without undue restriction.
723	3700	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it. I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases. One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that might want to see things that may not be suitable for them. First of all, children often follow after what they see. For example, adult trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are appropriate for young eyes. That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to. Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music. Violence is a main topic in newspaper articles. For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world. It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment. Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves. In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do. Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon? Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see? So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship. We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries? Keep these things separate: adult books, magazines, movies, music, etc., to maintain a more appropriate and respectful public space.
724	3701	2	3	Censorship. If someone does not like what a book, magazine, movie, etc., shows then they should put it back and not worry about it. But there are people who do make a big deal about that kind of stuff. Most people who do I personally think are immature. Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings, because of nude statues and the way they talked. A lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today. Sometimes there is no way of getting around inappropriate materials. Then there are a lot of people who find those subjects very interesting and like to study it. So by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain. The music that is out today has a lot of inappropriate words and sayings in them that would be offensive to most people. But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it. Most of the time they aren't listening to the words, but just like the beat of the song. Almost all of the older people hate this music and never wanna hear it and think it should be banned. What they don't realize is that if it was taken out of the library there would be more upset and angry people then happy. Magazines and movies today have a lot of inappropriate advertisements and pictures, but now that is what most people like and want to see. You can't really take anything out of a library because either way there would be a lot of upset people. Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely take the number of visitors that come to the library go down, because what they are interested in would not be there anymore so they would have no reason to go anymore. That is what most likely would happen if the books, magazines, movies, music, etc., were found offensive and were taken off the shelves, ultimately harming the library's purpose as a resource for the entire community.
725	3702	2	3	From what I have seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content. I think that libraries should keep the things on the shelves but separated from the rest if found offensive. It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it. I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people want to know why they censored it in the first place. My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended. I like the saying sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me because it says if you're offended then get over it. Why should your opinion speak for everyone else? Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless. I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard. My conclusion is that they should separate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library. They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it. Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have to look at the stuff that he hates, while others can still access the materials they seek.
726	3703	2	3	I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines etc. People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of speech and the right to write that stuff or say that stuff. Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people might like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive. For example people such as certain musicians. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speech to write and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just a reflection of his life. In history, some figures are controversial because they killed people. Should take him off the shelf because some people might think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that censored who knows history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times. So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speech to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, educate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offends you that its offensive to other people.
727	3704	2	3	Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored? Why should information and knowledge be withheld from people? Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading, but also the human race. There are two arguments to censorship in libraries. I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries. In this country, everyone is given the right of free speech. Taking someone's work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that persons' rights. Also, people go to libraries to find something out. They look for knowledge and taking away a persons' learning capacity can be harmful to everyone. When one article gets censored another article after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' We will take away man kind's capacity to learn. Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as: inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines. Also, obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines. These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version. All minor adjustments and easy to make. Taking media off the shelves is not needed. The material is not serious enough. Minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read, listen, or watch. A library is made for what the people want to learn. Taking that away is very serious and undermines the very purpose of such an institution.
728	3705	2	3	To me that is not good to take some music or book to be removed because that is not cool to do that because people read or sing what they feel most of the time. That is what people mostly do they read or sing what they feel about in what they feel in there body that is what I think that they should not removed they music or book, movies. You are going to remove people talents I do think that is ok to do that to those people they work hard to do what they like in just be the thing they say or done you are go to remove there talent no. The people that do like that than do listen to it or see just change it to something more than that. You know that is bad to remove there musics and books because you will remove there creativity to not just one thing you will remove more than what you think. You just make them lose everything to that is what they like or love to sing or do there books of what they think that is more than at book or song to them. I say no because that is what they like to do in if you do like it than just do here just change it than instead of making a big deal to them in make there life miserable by having people taking of them of what they sing or reading.
729	3706	2	3	Turn the page. If I see a book that I don't particularly care for, I simply put it down. I really don't see the need to deal with all books that might be offensive to a single person, or group of people. Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, when I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I couldn't imagine how scarce our book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive. Also, there are many people that find The Bible offensive. If we were to remove all religious text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of faith to people who do not have access to such literature. Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I don't like a certain author's book on evolution; but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and beliefs. As you can so clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs. However, when it comes to literature and and art, I think that a variety makes us unique. If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, then we could have a very boring culture. That is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded, and it is a principle worth defending.
730	3707	2	3	Dear Editor, There are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes. However, just because a book or song contains a foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes. There are many reasons we should not censor public media. We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in America, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people might start to think every little word has an offensive connotation. If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened. If the world never reported accidents, there would be too much crime and terror. Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today. Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it. After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people might not oppose slavery as strongly as they do. Here in America, we have the freedom of speech. We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way. We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong. People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience. Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people might judge almost every little word offensive then. Then we might have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson. Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations. If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out. Then, many words would be gone. Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language. However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song. I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing. People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is. We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring. If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act. However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror, which is why uncensored media is so vital for an informed and proactive society.  Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen
731	3708	2	3	Everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book. Therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching. Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project, providing essential information for research. Other people just want to be entertained by certain pieces of literature, or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries? Many people enjoy violent writing or gory movies. Reading these things also amuses them, providing a form of relaxation and escape. So why take away what they like? If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in. If one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then that's twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else. People are different in many ways. That includes the variety of things humans are interested in. For example, things they are interested to read. Humans having major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. The articles, magazines, or movies may be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's something someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it. Some books often offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets its uniqueness from what it says. Some books are written in times of racism. This shouldn't make a book worth criticizing because that was the way things were said in that time. It allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time it is based in, offering a valuable historical perspective. On the other hand, some magazines are written about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world. They want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home. Someone isn't able to know what's happening if no one lets him or her read the magazine. Authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. Due to the wide variety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings. People shouldn't have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves. That just wouldn't be fair. Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others may enjoy them, fostering a diverse and inclusive community of readers.
732	3709	2	3	When you go to a library you think it's going to be a place that is a good influence. You're not thinking when you send your kids there that there's going to be bad things. Most people go to the library to study or use the computers, expecting a safe and educational environment. But what about the other people? I went to the library and saw racist books most adults would find that offensive especially if it's an African American. The thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to study about the old times; it's not there to offend people. Some books are very informational and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesn't happen again, serving as important historical documents. Another problem most people have is with the adult books; parents definitely don't want their children looking or checking those books out. But when no one stops them from checking the books out there really is not anything you can do about it. I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certain books to protect younger patrons. The last thing is the music; it has bad language in it and kids can just check them out without even trying hard. Most parents try to shield their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language but when they can go to a community place and just listen to anything that causes a problem. Personally I think that it gives the library a bad name and therefore they get little business. You know that if you were a parent you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racist, adult books, and music and you would like for the government to take some the books and music out of the library. I believe that there should be a vote to see if we could have those books and music removed or at least put in an adult section in the back. My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censoring the books and music they put in the library and make accessible to the community. The upside to doing that is the library would get more customers and that means the government would make more money, creating a more family-friendly institution.
733	3710	2	3	Does The Book Deserve Censorship? There are a lot of books out there that I would love to take off the shelves but the one book I would want to take off the shelves would be 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. While I read that book it had a lot of offensive language and a lot of graphic content not only in the book but in the movie too. On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. The only thing good about the movie is there was a few dramatic scenes and that's it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like they liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repetitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must-reads for high school students. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact it was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are they need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards. So obviously 'To Kill A Mockingbird' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend a lot of people; I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year. So in conclusion, I think there should be censorship in libraries to filter out such potentially offensive material.
734	3711	2	3	I agree and disagree with the prompt. I think that it is good everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf, listen to any music, watch all types of movies, or read any type of magazine. Then I think it isn't okay. First, reason for agreeing is because some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. may not be suitable for most young children. They may use profanity, show naked pictures, or talk about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age. Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing. Also, adults may use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere. So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Then, on the other hand I think that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off. I say this because if a child does not get experienced to what could happen if they use bad language or go out without proper clothing, or go on watching adult movies, they might not understand the consequences. So this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age. I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permanently. In conclusion, I think that this could go both ways. But, the books, movies, music, or magazines that are felt like they are offensive should be moved to a certain area in the library, providing a balanced solution for all patrons.
735	3712	2	3	Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the censorship in a library. First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others, causing hurt and discomfort. Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life. Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults. Reading should be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read, considering age and maturity. Next, I would like to talk about some of the inappropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a little too much for some of the people that go to the library. Most magazines that are shown are for adults and teens over a certain age. I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group to ensure appropriate content. Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out. Libraries has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to learn more about their surroundings before they continue what they are doing. In conclusion, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold. Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences. Libraries need to change some of their ways and their selections to make things more successful on their behalf, ensuring they remain a positive community resource.
736	3713	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' as author Katherine Paterson once said. Books are primarily used to entertain and even teach readers valuable lessons about certain aspects of life. Not exactly all books are offensive, but some undoubtedly are. Those which are offensive should be taken off the shelves, especially if they are located in a school library. Children could take that offensive or violent book and turn its ideas into action. Other children could show the book to their peers, spreading its content. And also, children can get very offended by what they read. Now should offensive books be taken off the shelves?  Children nowadays are being influenced and motivated a lot. Whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music, they are constantly exposed to various media. On the news, there have been reports about children being influenced to acquire a gun or to hang themselves, etc. Books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person. Some impressionable readers who read such things can turn those words into real-world action. Then the student could be in serious trouble, and people really wouldn't want that to happen.  Children have a natural tendency of showing off to their friends. If a student sees something offensive or violent in a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers, often just because children think it's cool or edgy. Having one person read this material could be a problem; now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this. It could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school itself. The children learning these new things from the book can cause them to use the concepts every day and make them popular. The school can develop a bad image because of the students' actions. Passing on the information can become a major conflict, and people certainly do not want that.  School is not only a teaching building, but also a social place. There are cliques in every school, and within each person there is a different color, religion, style, and personality. Children can be easily hurt by words and images. If books are being offensive, they can just as easily hurt anyone reading that book. Once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them emotionally. So why even have authors write something offensive in their books? Perhaps authors feel the need to add interest and suspense to the book, but not all readers would take it easily or understand the context. Hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that.  So why have offensive books on shelves? These books can cause children to use their ideas in action, to show them off to other peers, and to hurt them as well. Children nowadays have it hard enough on themselves; why make it harder for them? Books are meant to entertain readers, so why not just do that. So yes, taking the offensive books off the shelves will help ensure there will be no such problems.
737	3714	2	3	Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. The primary reason why I think some things should be removed is because some kids simply don't need to look at certain things that are inappropriate for their age. Parents don't always go with their children to the library to monitor them and tell them what they can and can't get. At school libraries, they really don't have many bad things as they only have school-approved and appropriate materials. But the public library has a lot of different things, a much wider and less filtered selection than a school library. This lack of oversight is precisely why certain materials should be removed to protect children from accidental exposure. Therefore, those are my reasons why I believe certain offensive materials should be removed from library shelves.
738	3715	2	3	Censorship is a topic that touches many aspects of our lives. In everyday life we see stuff that we think is inappropriate and should be removed, but do we have the right to be able to get that certain item off the shelves to stop the spread of this material, and is it safe for the future of kids not to see this kind of content in stores, libraries, and book stores? These are important questions to consider.  Most cartoons, for instance, have violence in them; as a matter of fact, almost all of them do. Every conflict is often resolved through violence over a certain thing. Kids sit down to watch these and may not understand that there is violence in them, and they may fail to understand that it is wrong to be violent like the characters they see on TV. Clearly, some shows and movies are not right for kids and their developing minds.  The same principle applies to books. Nowadays kids get into newer books based off of movies, like the Twilight series. These book series have violence in them, and if parents had to censor what their kids could or could not read, most of these popular books would be off the shelf and wouldn't be able to be viewed by anyone, mostly kids who are eager to read them.  In newspapers, there is violence shown, reported, or even been told in detail. As a matter of kids' safety, if they saw it they might want to go and see if it is still going on and to see it for themselves. Kid safety is a high priority because we care about their future and what they read, view, or even hear from books, TV, movies, and in newspapers.  All these reasons are good enough to give parents some right to censorship on what their kids read, hear, and view on a daily basis. Even if cartoons show violence, kids can watch them and enjoy them, but they should be guided not to act out the violence shown in the cartoons and not to repeat some of the bad language it says in them. This balanced approach allows for enjoyment without imitation.
739	3716	2	3	Should libraries remove offensive reading material? No, I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just because some people find it offensive. There's offensive material everywhere in the world. Just because you find a book offensive doesn't mean someone else does; it is a highly subjective matter. In my opinion, if a person finds something offensive, they simply shouldn't look at it or read it. They have the choice to walk away.  A few months ago I was at the library. I was trying to find a book to read for an essay I had to write. I overheard two girls talking nearby. They were arguing about something, so I moved a little closer to them so I could hear their conversation. 'What's this one about?' the first girl asked. 'That's a really good book! It's about these two people who fall in love and their love lives. It goes on to talk about how the man tries to find a woman after the girl he fell in love with dies, and about his love life after she's gone,' the other girl said. 'So you're saying it's about sex?' the first girl asked, sounding concerned. 'A little, but only slightly,' the other girl answered. 'I'm not going to read this!' the first girl declared. 'But why not?' the second girl asked, confused. 'Because it talks about sex! Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this,' the first girl answered. 'It sends the wrong message,' she added. After those girls left I went and got the book they were talking about. I started reading it. Interesting. Actually, it was a very good book. The second girl was right. It wasn't mainly about sex. It was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and what the man went through after his love died.  That encounter got me thinking. Should certain reading material be removed because it talks about sex, drugs, murders, etc., or because someone finds its content offensive? No, it shouldn't. There's offensive material in real life and that's not being removed. Why should a book be removed from a library? What does it matter if the topic is in a book? There is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone. That's just how life is, and learning to navigate that is part of growing up.
740	3717	2	3	Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Well, people have the right to look at what they want, and to hear what they want. That is a fundamental freedom. Some think it's not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves where anyone can see them. Some people think it's perfectly alright. I guess it all just depends on that person and their personal feelings. There is no universal standard.  Let's say I was in the library and I did see something that I found offensive. Well, the world does not stop and say, 'hey look at that, she finds that offensive so let's take that off the shelves just to please her'. I am sorry but that's not how life works. If you don't like looking at it, then just turn the other way. If it were me, I would be worried about more important things such as wars or things going on in my own life, other than something offensive on the book shelves. People have different priorities.  It's a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller, and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people don't like to look at, or to maybe hear, things that are offensive. Here's what I say to it: get over it. You cannot control everything you encounter.  The other day I was at the bait shop and I heard a word that I dare not even say, and I truly hate hearing that word. What was I going to do, tell a grown man to not say that?...... I just rolled my eyes and went on about my business. That was the mature way to handle it.  Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Well, like I've been saying this whole time, in life there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it and move on. Sometimes getting over offensive things that you see are not easy, but hey, life's not easy, and we must learn to cope with differences.
741	3718	2	3	If I found a book that offended me, I would have to go and take it off the shelf because if I find that a book is offensive, I know that others would think the same. I agree some books can be offensive to some and not to others, and its really not fair for those who think that way, as their feelings are just as valid. One reason that I would take it from that shelf would be to keep young children from reading it. Parents don't really want their children reading about violence and murder, as such topics are too harsh for young minds. Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist against another person or people, people killing others, and them doing sexual things. People really shouldn't read things like that because it puts ideas in their heads and sometimes makes them think the same way as the writer, which can lead to harmful actions. If children read books about violence and sexual actions, they could think that it's okay to do these things to other people and get into a lot of trouble with the law and their parents. Children really need to be kept away from these kinds of books, until they're older and understand what's right and what's wrong. Some books have a lot of cursing in them, and a lot of children pick up on words and start using them more and more until it becomes a habit that is hard to break. Even though some books are about real people, they should still be taken off the shelves. In some of these books, there is a lot of violence and children should not be exposed to that kind of book content. Books can sometimes be more bad than good. If everybody had their way and could take a book that offended them off the shelf whenever they wanted, then there would be no books left for anyone to read and learn from.
742	3719	2	3	If people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and etcetera, then they will if they feel it is offensive to others. I wish they would not, but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so. They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing, then they will feel it is okay to say or do those things that they read or hear. It also is common sense to not do those things that people wrote about. The authors write things to entertain and to educate us about things that were okay in the time period that the story, in this case, was set in, which was acceptable back then. Most people these days take things way too serious now, mostly because we have things like lawsuits and discrimination. If someone can find something to complain about, they will do so. If there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1 had slaves and if they are calling them a name that is not very nice, then someone can complain and say that it is racial and there will be a dispute about it, and the author will most likely lose and have to change that word into something else. People do not realize how much this happens; it happens a lot especially with books. Movies are a whole different thing now; the things that happen in the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with it. There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4. @CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1. There are certain things that can be in those movies. @CAPS2 @NUM1 there can be a lot more things; it can be scary to an extent and there also sometimes sexual things, but they do not show the whole thing. There also can be villains and some swearing, not a lot though. @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that's a whole new level; they can have anything they really want and it's a little more than @CAPS2 @NUM1; they kind of have a little more graphic content than @CAPS2 @NUM1. Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4; it depends on how graphic things are. Music is a whole other thing depending on what kind of music you are listening to, like there's @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and etcetera. With all those, they talk about sex and violence. Now all of them except country talk about drugs and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1. There are some that talk about more things, but most of them that's what they talk about. If parents do not want their children listening to it, then they do not listen. There are ways of still listening to it. Most radio stations cannot swear on the radio, but they just cut it out. There are ways to have the uncut version, but that's on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player. There are ways to get around it. See, I think that it is dumb to take things like that away mostly, because they are going to see or hear about it someday anyways, especially when they are in high school. Most teens do things without their parents knowing, and when they start driving they can listen to whatever they want. Also, they can read anything they want to, because they can buy the book and read it and hide it. Face it, kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do. No matter what age they are, they find ways to do what they want if they want it bad enough. I think if a school wants to read something, then they should have to have parent consent about it, and if the kids cannot read it then they can do something else instead or read something else. Do not take things off the shelf just because a couple of students cannot read or watch it. You're spoiling it for the kids that want to and can; it is really unfair to the rest of the students; they cannot help it that their parents won't let them. If the parents won't, then try to talk to them and tell them about it to help them understand. Also, people should have to watch what they do; just because there's a kid, the parent should leave them with a babysitter or something to manage the situation.
743	3720	2	3	The viewpoint is that books should not be taken off the shelves if found offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 help the other person understand or cope. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library. In a library, everybody should have the right to read every book available to them. The idea of taking a book off the shelf is bad because people want to read books like that for various reasons. Some people have a problem with that type of book, but if they don't like it then they should tell people not to read it, not take it off the shelf entirely. If anything, put it in a different area or just move it; put all that type of book in one area, not mixed in with others. When people need help, they read a book or look it up for guidance. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems, then don't even move it from its place. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive, as they can provide valuable perspectives. We don't know all of the reasons, but there are a lot of them that justify access. If a movie is not good for children or just very horrid, it @MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look, or perhaps in a restricted section. Kids and grown-ups are the same in that nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad for their mental state. Usually, when somebody takes something offensive, they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it to themselves or others. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose, but they don't; they write it and somebody is guilty of something and cannot live up to it, leading to discomfort. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood, causing unnecessary offense. Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive, but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny or enlightening. The biggest problem is some people can't read well, and then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly, missing the true meaning. I don't feel like certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something they see reflected in the text. If the materials should be moved, they should just be moved to a different area, not off of the shelves totally, preserving access. If it is taken as offensive, they should tell the librarian, and then if very many more people say it is offensive, then it can be considered for removal, but only after careful review.
744	3721	2	3	The belief that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive depends on the situation the material is relating to. If one wants to see these types of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand their content. It all depends on where the material is located in the library and what situation it's in. If it is in the children's area, I highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information at such a young age. If it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be for others. In the adult section, however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material without negative effects. One example of this aspect on whether inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called '@CAPS1 tales' or '@CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION1'. These types of materials have content ranging from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section. Now, people from ages @NUM1 years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information. Some teens would be horrified of looking through these books, and others would be fascinated by it, showing different reactions. It varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read for entertainment. It all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in the library setting. Another example on whether inappropriate material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations based on their content. There was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she had never saw before out of curiosity. So once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie that caused discomfort. The person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation without proper consideration. If the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine; but she was young still and so it made the matter worse for her understanding. Whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed, and so it shows that one person's experience can change the difference in the situation for everyone. Therefore, whether this type of material should be taken off the shelves depends, once again, on the specific situation it is located in and the audience it reaches.
745	3722	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines—we've all had the pleasure of seeing, reading, or watching our favorites, but many are considered unsatisfactory in their content to younger children. Parents, now more than ever, are concerned about how their children are raised, and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives to protect them. Things with heavy violence, gore, language, and even scenes of sexual content—all of these are wanted by all parents to be censored from their childs' eyes for their well-being. There are many reasons why parents worldwide wish to hide these things from the eyes of the young, such as personal influence, emotional growth, and even the chance of a child becoming disobedient to the parent. These are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye to maintain a safe environment. Again, we've all read or heard things that affect us personally; maybe you read on how you can make your life happier, or maybe you heard an inspirational song that convinced you to follow your dreams. Well, this is also true for everyday books, movies, magazines, or music in a negative way. If someone is introduced to something telling of a life with hatred or someone living in a violent way, it can influence a young reader to wish to live the same style of life if it sounds even a little remotely fun or exciting. True, children are encouraged to have fun, but to a certain and safe extent that does not harm them. These media are even known to affect someone's emotions deeply. Maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh with joy. But it is true the opposite way as well, having a dark impact. Songs that are dark and have a gloomy feeling to them can make a person feel depressed or sad, or a scary movie @MONTH1 leave a person with a new fear or a nightmare in their sleep the same night, causing distress. It has even been known that some children are left traumatized for life just because they weren't ready for what they saw in certain violent and gory scenes that were too intense. These are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe and emotionally stable. People are very easily moved by any form of information, song, and story alike, so we must be cautious. It is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away from vulnerable minds. Children are easily affected in behavior; maybe they just saw a movie of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him, imitating his actions. If a child is exposed to a movie of great violence or bad influence,
746	3723	2	3	Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern, Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover. In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries. Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel. When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to. People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences. Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated.
747	3724	2	3	Well to begin my Persuasive @CAPS1. THATS @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! How could they!? Dont we have a say in this?.... Well.... WE SHOULD!!!! This is a little bit about what i think of this letter. I think that if books, movies, music, magazines,or anything else is offensive, then we shouldnt have them in libraries because its not right, and its @CAPS2 cuel, and people shouldn't putting those things there if there insalting to others or mean to them. In my experenice, I have had that happen where I cheaked out a book on something and it turned out very Offensive to me. It was at the @ORGANIZATION1 when I was @NUM1 years old. My parents and I where there for some movie or something, and we were looking at some books that were there, and came across a book called' @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1 ' And it was offensive to me because @CAPS5 was the reglion I was raised in, and they @CAPS2 talked about there feelings on faith, and how they thought of it. And it made me hurt because I go to chruch and read the @CAPS6-I-@CAPS6-@CAPS8-@CAPS9. And i was raised on a type of faith that I know alot about. And if you read that book, it made my question everything i belived. So to rap up my thoughts and feelings. I think it shouldn't be there for people to read, like i said before. People have other books they can have there instead of one that are offensive poeple. All in all I hope you think about my persuassive letter, and tell them about your thoughts and ideas too, so that we can make our libraries a more respectful and considerate place for everyone.
748	3725	2	3	Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the librairy on @DATE1 @TIME1 looking at some books. Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway. @CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it. So school went by the bell rang it was time to go. When she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian. On our walk to the librairy @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink. While were were there she got a newspapaer to read about what was going on at the scool when she noticed something about books about how they needed to be taken off the shelf. when we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help. @CAPS1 said no but I need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her. That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelfs. And moving the to the back closet. About a week or so later @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library it said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones. Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldnt do it because of one person said it was offensive but they did it any way, showing how a single complaint can lead to significant changes in what is available for everyone to read.
749	3726	2	3	Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well. Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books. It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them.
750	3727	2	3	Do I believe that ceertain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? NO, the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me,they might not be offensive to other people. Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not. I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them. That excites me. Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well thats a gud question. Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn'@CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way. They were just writing a book. It's not the writers fault. He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive. DON'@CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's. So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive. Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book. So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's. Thanks for the conversation. See you next time.
751	3728	2	3	Society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not. We witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to, from public debates to private conversations. It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove each other wrong, debating what is admissible and what is not. We should try with all our efforts to keep inappropriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population. People can be influenced to do just about anything, as history and current events have shown. There are too many of these tales to pick out even one. The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly, without any personal contact. Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe over time. The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative, shaping character and worldview. As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen. It is no different with books, which can be even more immersive. Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal of corrupting the mind. I am not in any way against reading books, rather I am quite on the contrary, being an avid reader myself. Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world. But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us. If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves and their choices. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well, offering both enjoyment and moral guidance. We as members of the community are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not. We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obscene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society. If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general, for the sake of public order. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time, and those are the materials we should promote.
752	3729	2	3	Dear Newspaper; In libraries I do not feel it is necessary to take stuff away that people could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it. You are your own person and can make your own decisions, and if this so called offensive material is not viewed as offensive by someone else, then that is their right. Then why should that person be punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something they personally dislike? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it, and we must respect that difference. If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it; if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them and can exercise their own judgment. There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, or where they want to get it from. From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someone else's music offensive, but they don't say anything or demand its removal. They just ignore it and move on with their day, and the world needs more people like that. More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in, fostering a more tolerant society. It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way too much about what other people are doing with their own time. That is not a bad thing necessarily, as concern for others is a virtue, but everyone will be offended by something at some point; it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. Listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want, as is your right. If someone finds them offensive, so be it; that is their personal feeling. You are your own person and that won't ever change, so you should be free to make your own choices. Do what makes you happy and nothing else, as long as it does not harm others.
753	3730	2	3	Why censor things? When there's always going to be someone out there wanting to read a book or magazine that others think should be censored, creating a never-ending conflict. If this vicious circle would continue then we wouldn't have any books left at all to read, as every title offends someone. There's lots of things out there that some people don't like but that doesn't give them the right to take it off the shelf. Then by doing that and taking it off the shelf just because they didn't think it was an appropriate book, they impose their views on everyone. This will leave someone with nothing to read now, depriving them of material they may find valuable. If the books or magazines would start being taken off the shelves then we would have less ways to research or learn certain things, hindering education and intellectual freedom. Even though there might be graphic pictures or writing in books or magazines doesn't automatically make them inappropriate for all; context is important. It needs to be labeled on the book that it has such content inside, providing a clear warning. If you see the mark and you don't want to look at it then you don't have to; it is a simple matter of personal choice. We need to code books for different ages, creating a sensible system for everyone. Then parents could be happy if their little boy or girl could only read certain books because of how old they are, ensuring age-appropriate content. Then if parents give permission then children could read books that were meant for older kids or adults, allowing for guided learning. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of reading but I will sometimes pick up a book that has things for me to learn in it about an engine or other practical topics. I don't think that people should be able to restrict anything and take it off the shelves; everyone has their own right to read the book or watch the movie, etc., as they see fit. But children are different because they don't need to learn all those things at an early age, so protection is reasonable. So parents can pick what they can read, but if you're an adult you should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever you want to without interference.
754	3731	2	3	There are many things in this world that children should not see and that poison the minds of them and others whatever age they may be. The things people see these days can be bad and shouldn't be seen by anybody of any age, as they can corrupt one's morals. These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also, preserving our collective decency. The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same things? The content is harmful regardless of age. But if things like this are in libraries then the question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right or wrong for everyone else? Since the world's population is so large and so many people have different ideas and moral standards, then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad? Well the answer would be that it is impossible to find such a person with universal authority. That is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis, guiding their own household according to their values and beliefs, which is the most practical solution.
755	3732	2	3	I believe that some materials should not be on the shelves, but not removed entirely from the library. They should have a room with everything that someone could find offensive or inappropriate for general viewing. Some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should not be totally removed from a public library, as they may serve a purpose for some patrons. I have seen a little kid pull an adult book off the shelf, which was clearly not meant for them. The mother got very mad at the library for having it so low, on the bottom shelf where small hands could reach. I can understand some books being in the library for research or adult education. They should have all the adult books and etc. on the higher shelves so the little kids cannot reach them, providing a simple physical barrier. The library should have a room for only kids, and teenagers books, magazines, music, movies and etc., creating a safe space for younger patrons. The kids should not be allowed in parts of the library that are too violent, or sexual in nature, to protect their innocence. The library should also have a room for all the adult movies and books with a locked door, along with the kid room, to control access. If the library does not have enough money for the rooms, they can at least put all of the adult stuff on a top shelf or higher shelf as a cost-effective measure. I believe that some materials should not be on the shelves, but not removed from the library because someone might need that book to research something for school or a job, and its removal would be a disservice. It could also take someone's history out of the library if it is removed, erasing valuable cultural records. I mean there is a reason the book, movie, magazine, music, or etc. was made, whether for art, information, or entertainment. There is a reason that the material is there, and it may be important to someone. Also the parents can help the library, by keeping a closer eye on their kids and monitoring their selections. Watch what they grab off the shelf and guide them towards suitable choices. The parent can even have a friend or neighbor watch the children while the parent goes to the library so the kids won't see anything they shouldn't, which is a responsible approach. I believe everything I have wrote here is the truth about the way things should be in a public library, balancing access with protection. The adult stuff should be higher up, out of the immediate reach of children. If a parent doesn't like the library's policy, they can leave their kid at home, or not go to that library anymore, exercising their own choice in the matter.
756	3733	2	3	There are many kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library, offering a vast spectrum of human thought and creativity. People all over the world have different interests in different subjects, which is why this diversity is so crucial. Some people take offence to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc. Another person may not and think it's offensive at all. For example, a religious book that talks about a deity being one specific figure when some people believe differently might be controversial. The book should not be put away, for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs available on the very same shelves. The variety of subjects in a library such as songs, magazines and everything else in the library is huge, representing countless perspectives. There should never be a book, movie, or item removed when one person takes offence to it because, as in Katherine Paterson's quote, it makes the point that if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf anyone could. Which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem, creating an empty and homogenous collection. People would not be able to read as much as they'd like because they would not have the ability to pick between many options, severely limiting their access to information. The library provides essential information for teachers, students, researchers, writers and for readers who do it as a hobby. If that was taken away from people, the people would become less informed about many things in the world, hindering education and intellectual growth. In a free society, freedom is important and we expect it, freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests. Therefore if items were being removed from a public place that gives that, such a society would not let this happen. People have the right to like whatever they want, and if someone takes offence to an item in the library they should simply walk away from it and not stress about removing it for everyone else.
757	3734	2	3	It does not really matter to me, as we all have the right to our own likes and dislikes. Someone might not think that movies with blood in them should be allowed, but other may think that movies with adult content should not be allowed either. If you don't like something and someone else does, why should you get what you want and not what someone else wants? It is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. So if we take one movie, book, magazine, type of song or music off the market, why don't we just take all of them off the market? Then there will be no argument about what is suitable to watch and what is not, but there would also be nothing left to enjoy. So if you don't like something or have little kids and don't want them to watch something or read something or look at something, then just don't buy it for them and if you do own such items, make sure they are stored where children cannot reach or find or get to them easily. This approach allows everyone to curate their own experience without imposing restrictions on others.
758	3735	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because little kids shouldn't be watching, seeing, or hearing them. Violence is not a good thing for little kids to be watching because they will want to grow up and fight, imitating what they see on screen. We already have a high teen violence rate, and this is a serious concern for our community. Our teen violence rate really needs to be lowered to ensure a safer environment for everyone. When teens start to fight they don't have control of themselves, often leading to harmful consequences. The movies in my opinion need to really be removed because that is how children are learning to fight and resolve conflicts aggressively. They see an older kid fighting in a film and they want to try it out in the schoolyard. Movies are a bad influence on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing, glorifying these actions. Movies could also get kids to be bullies, teaching them negative social behaviors. When a kid is a bully they don't really know what they are getting themselves into, causing lasting harm to others. Another bad example would be drugs and alcohol, which are often depicted in media. Teens and other children get put into peer pressure, which is a powerful force. When teens and other children have peer pressure it's hard to say no, making them vulnerable to bad decisions. The kinds of music people listen to can also be a bad influence on kids, containing explicit content. The music that kids listen to would have something about killing, drugs, and alcohol, normalizing these topics. When kids get involved in drugs and alcohol that will mess up their whole life, leading to addiction and health problems. For example, the screamo music to me sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone, promoting aggression. Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading due to their often inappropriate content. Magazines have bad images in them and when teens see the images they want to act and or be just like the people that are in the pictures, which can set unrealistic standards. Books, movies, music and magazines should be removed from the shelves because of all the violence and negative influences they contain. There are so many different fights and different teens that get other kids into peer pressure, creating a cycle of harm. That is why I am persuading you to take these offensive items off the shelves to protect our youth.
759	3736	2	3	How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, many citizens can take what these items say more offensively than what it may seem on the surface. They may seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across our communities, but is it really true, or is it a matter of heightened sensitivity? Due to all the different races our society sees every single day, sometimes we may not be doing our best to accept their different cultural backgrounds in our modern day society. I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all white school how most people judge other races other than their own, whether it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc. Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way, with such disrespect. Taking this all into consideration, I think that whether or not they are racial books, magazines, or movies they should not be removed from their distribution around the world simply for discussing difficult topics. I know that whether or not these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it, as they have educational value. I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc. It's a part of our shared history and I enjoy learning about it very much, gaining a deeper understanding. It may seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through may just seem like a joke towards them to make fun of all they went through, even though it is not meant that way at all by the creators. I also understand that there are people who write books about Mexican jokes, black jokes, etc. or even make comedy movies joking over different races. These types of things I think should be taken off the shelves everywhere! These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural background in a genuinely harmful manner. When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on. I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on different races, unless it is purposely made for the reason of making fun of people or promoting hatred. I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural background in most general cases. The magazines I read about, like Seventeen magazine, seem to comment about how beautiful people are, focusing on fashion and lifestyle. Overall, I think that making fun of different races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better. Even though all these different items such as: movies, magazines, books and music may seem racial to some, I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the history and complexity of our world, but if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a different race, that should definitely be removed from every shelf around the world to prevent genuine harm.
760	3737	2	3	Should books that are offensive be removed from library shelves? Some books in the library are offensive to some people but should the books be removed from the shelves entirely? I personally don't think the books should be removed, as this sets a dangerous precedent. Some people may think the books do need to be removed while some don't, creating a division in opinion. What is your choice to this difficult question that libraries often face? First off, as I said before, I don't think the books should be removed; but some people may not like my opinion, which is their right. These books should not be removed just because they are offensive to other people; offense is often subjective. If another finds any book offensive, that person should just ignore the book, not ask for it to be taken off the shelf. Someone else might want to read that same book but if it is taken off the shelf then that person can't read the book, which is a loss for them. It isn't fair to take books off the shelf just because someone finds the book offensive; it prioritizes one person's sensitivity over another's right to access information. Any person that finds a book offensive should just ignore it and not read the book, exercising personal choice. That book that is offensive to someone isn't directed to he or she; the author's opinion shouldn't matter so much as to remove access for all. Second, everyone's opinion is different, which is a fundamental aspect of a diverse society. Some people want the books off the shelves some people don't, so who gets their way in this little argument? I think the books should stay on the shelves to serve the entire community. One person may find the book offensive and the next person may not, highlighting the subjectivity of the issue. Other people may not even read the offensive book, so it does not affect them. But no matter if the book is read or not it shouldn't be taken off the shelf; it just isn't fair to all the other people who actually do want to read that book for their own purposes. Lastly, everyone enjoys different book themes, and a library should reflect that diversity. If you don't like the theme of the book then why are you reading it in the first place? If you don't like the book or you find it offensive, go choose another book from the vast selection available. Don't make it to where other people can't read the book if they like those kind of themes; that is an act of censorship. You wouldn't like it if that happened to you, if a book you valued was removed. No one would like that, having their choices limited by others. Just pick a book that has a theme you like and let others do the same. So as you can see, I don't think it is fair that books get taken off the shelf if people find the book offensive, as this practice undermines the library's mission. Some people may like that theme of the book or the story it has to it, finding value where others do not. Some people have different opinions of the book or it means something different to them, which is the power of literature. And just because someone finds a book offensive doesn't mean it should be taken off the shelf; it just isn't fair to other people who wish to explore a wide range of ideas.
761	3738	2	3	Have you ever read a book you thought was offensive? Have you ever read a book you didn't want anyone else to read? I agree with Katherine Paterson that if we can take one book off the shelves, we can take all the books off the shelf. Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor, which means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everyone else, and then we will have no books to read at libraries. This is why I agree with Katherine on this subject; books are written for us to read, not to be censored just because some stuck-up parent doesn't want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy. Magazines that people think are offensive should be put in a different area so the kids can't get them. The same with movies; some movies are not meant for kids, but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf! One thing we can do is put the vulgar movies that we don't want our children watching behind the counter and have the librarian get them when we watch them. As far as the books, we can make a separate part of the library for books that kids shouldn't read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, and some action books. Music is another thing that some parents have a hard time with because of the offensive lyrics in them, but some people like that kind of music so we can't take that away from them because we don't like it. Does that seem fair? Now, do some of those books seem a little better now? Yes, we still don't want our kids reading vulgar books about killing, and romance, and serial killers, but some people enjoy reading those novels. This is why I agree with Katherine @PERSON1 that censorship sets a dangerous precedent for everyone's freedom to read.
762	3739	2	3	Libraries in @LOCATION1 are a shared resource for the entire community. I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive. I don't think that just because something is offensive to someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject. I think if someone doesn't like what's in the book, they should just not read it, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example, the author of the book or magazine somehow relates to the content, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. That's why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. That's what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf. So whoever is reading this, please take this into consideration and realize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So that's all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because they're offensive to them; we must respect the diverse tastes of all readers.
763	3740	2	3	In Libraries there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that @MONTH1 be found offensive to many, but it might be what some people like to read; therefore we must keep all of the materials no matter how crude. These library materials are all part of the world's past and all have a bigger story behind them which has an even bigger story behind it and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn from. The world will be less intelligent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magazines off the shelves of a library, for it @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others, but in the end they all contain some past that no other book @MONTH1 contain. A world with no so called inappropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that @MONTH1 be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelf than none would be left. The books would start to lose their love, compassion, and livelihood within them. Other books @MONTH1 contain segregation, and segregation is a big part of America's past. The word negroe is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word negroe out then we would lose @NUM1 years of America's past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and falling of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violence was too offensive. Many historic moments in the world's history would be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world's past. The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in their own section in the library then kids would not be able to see them, causing this to be no problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive then you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and then magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books than we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to. In @CAPS1 this is how we could censor books in libraries without destroying them. Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today. It is what changes countries and makes them different; it gives them their own culture which we can share with each other. So no matter what we should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries. Censorship @MONTH1 be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again. All in all we cannot extinguish the flames of our past or we @MONTH1 never have a future to learn from.
764	3741	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that requires a balanced approach. I think that censorship in a library is fine; some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true, there are a lot of things that even adults shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things, so that access can be managed appropriately. However, people should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library, as long as it is organized in a way that protects younger patrons from material deemed unsuitable. This balanced approach respects both parental concerns and the intellectual freedom of all library users.
765	3742	2	3	Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose. This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's. Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books people read. Censorship of books is completely unnecessary. If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to. Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it. Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book. Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose. Finding a book offensive is simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence. So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not? Just because somebody running a library believes a book to be offensive or inappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf. There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive. Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already. Movies for example, are all rated, and this therefore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch. The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects. By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films. It is simply not their responsibility. Music also is rated, and if thought necessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content. Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be inappropriate. Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'. As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's. Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians. Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise, as this freedom is fundamental to a democratic society.
766	3743	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I don't think there should be censorship at all. Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy. Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist. Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone? It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie, as it dismisses their creative effort and intent.  There are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries. My first reason is freedom of speech. People have the right to say or write whatever they believe. Just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend. Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to, fostering a society of open dialogue.  Also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way. By using Censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves. Not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them. If no one can read the books, no one learns from the ideas and stories contained within them, which impoverishes our collective understanding.  One more thing to take into consideration, is the authors money. Alot of times in the library if I see a book I really like, I'll go buy it. But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them. The author's write these books so they can make a point and make money. If we take the books down, they dont make money and they dont make their intended point, which is a disservice to their work and livelihood.  In conclution I think censory is overall a bad idea. One because of freedom of speech. Second is it could possibly drastically effect literature. Third is its taking away authors money and point of view. These are the important reasons I do not surrport censory and believe it ultimately harms a free and informed society.
767	3744	2	3	I dont think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf because if some people dont like it some other people might find it intertaining than what other people do. I think that if people dont want there children to see it then dont let them, as it is a parent's responsibility to guide their own child's consumption.  I believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all. I mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago. I mean it is all put out there to be seen not hidden from eople because people want others to know what has happened even if they take it the wrong way. Knowledge of history and current events is crucial for understanding the world.  I would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right. There is some stuff out there in books, magazines, and ect. that shoouldnt be seen or heard of but people listen and read it all the time no matter what it is. Schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down? No, because education involves confronting difficult topics in a managed way.  Some people homeschool their kids for that reason ,but do they think about when they go out in public what people say or do? I dont think so, there is really no reason that if people take it offensive about something they read or listen to. Sheltering children completely is impractical in a world filled with diverse and unfiltered information.  There is no reason for people to take it off the shelf if they dont like it because other people will and they will buy it just to listen or to read something. People need to realize that there is stuff everywhere that people dont want their children hearing but they hear it anyway. It is just hoe our economy is these days, and individual choice should prevail over broad restrictions.
768	3745	2	3	Yes! i believe that because such as books had alots of informtions also when listen musice i feel like so sweet like i maen i'm so happy... when i read the magazines i know about the world something about people and animlas about...

Yes! i belive that because the magazines is good for reading .one think when i caome american i feel like so sad because i don't no anyboday also i don't no how to read magazines that's why, and two month later i have new friend then they teach me how to speak English and they teached me how to read magazines which opened up a new world for me. Yers later i got alots of friends in school my teacher told me kabee don't worry about to learn speak English when you come school everyday you will be speak English very well then i'm studies everyday for learn speak English.  Now i can speak English very well at school i love all teacher because they are teached me how to speak English that's why. Through these media, I found connection, knowledge, and a new voice in a new country, which was a very important part of my life and growth.
769	3746	2	3	In the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private. If this something is said and we don't like it we find the urge to rid the world of to 'protect' other people from it. In modern writing today and all throughout history there have been certain books that we don't like because they go against what we find moraly right. But just because a group of people say it's wrong is there a need to completely abolish from the library?  No. When something is written it is written for a purpose. If there was no purpose then we wouldn't have anything to read at all in the first place. Yes, there are some books and magazine's that can be very vivid and unsutable for younger minds to experience. But that it is why these books are created for older people to read, not for a general audience that includes children.  I am a large fan of books over the two great wars that took place. I find them very fascinating and I love to see what my life could be like today if the outcomes of those wars would have been different. I will admit many of these books contain things that are very real in a sense that some adults even can't handle, but this would be no reason to get rid of them all together. These books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know. Without these books these events can become something in the past and nothing more, losing their power to teach us valuable lessons.  There are also many books out there that have a large deal to do with very mature themes. These books can include very detailed areas about a sex scene. Yes indeed these books can definently be very unsutable for younger kids. But that is where the idea that these books were not created for them. They were created for older more mature readers. Also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in. The parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading, guiding them appropriately.  Looking out for what are children see is a large matter, the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books. For instance when people find something that they truly believe in they can become very motivated to expand peoples knoledge of that matter. If one person reads a book about poloitics and see a side that they have never seen before they could become driven to form a group to drive that thought or matter into all of the minds of the human race. This could greatly affect us by having a large amount of people come to an uproar at a group even as large as our current governament. But even though this could happen what type of free, run by the people for the people, group are we now if we start limiting thought?  Overall putting restrictions on the things we read or see, to our country, would have to be moraly wrong. Limiting what are nation can see would lead to most likely more of an uproar than just having to deal with different thoughts or outlooks of a group of people. This could happen because people would see it as the government maybe making more socialist acts by trying to control our knoledge and dictate what we are allowed to think about.
770	3747	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the library shelves. If the materials propose things like racism, I would like those items taken off the shelves. Sometimes politics have a say in this. This is my say on this topic, reflecting a balance between access and basic moral standards.  First off, people have an option of looking at those things on the shelves or on the internet. All of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive. Lots of people have families and kids and they don't want their kids to have to see that kind of stuff. The parents have the knowlegde of where most of the materials in libraries are and can steer their children accordingly. Also if the parents want to get books, why not go to a different library and get books. Or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored. I only have one execption though, if the materials in the book, music, movie, magazine is racist in anyway, I would want that removed from the shelf to maintain a baseline of respect and equality.  Many people have the choice of wheather or not to go to a place that has offensive materials. Sometimes the local, state or even the federal government have a say in wheather or not this kind of material gets put on the shelves of libraries or on the internet. Who knows, maybe someone likes these kinds of books, music, magazines, movies etc., and they don't want them takin off the the shelves or off the internet. Even going on the computer and 'surfing the web' for stuff like that is a little bit crazy, but thats their choice. So thats my view on the censorship in libraries, which ultimately favors individual choice and parental guidance over widespread removal of content, with a clear exception for harmful ideologies like racism.
771	3748	2	3	Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive? YES! Children should not be exposed to certain things at a young age. Some books and magazines are simply too explicit for children at certain developmental stages. Children should primarily read books that meet their specific age group and comprehension level. If children read books that are inappropriate for their age, they might start to act out that way, mimicking behaviors they do not yet understand. Parents should try and remove all books that are offensive to their children because that content can have a real bad affect on them, potentially shaping their worldview negatively. Children at a certain age group should read books that are on their level and appropriate for them, fostering healthy growth. Certain books, magazines, music, and movies are too explicit for kids these days. I think they should all be blocked and kept out of children's reach to protect their innocence. If children started to listen to inappropriate music and read offensive books it might negatively affect the way they act and interact with others. Children should not be exposed to things that might brain wash them or present harmful ideas as normal. If kids start to read horrible books and listen to bad music, imagine what affect it might have on them in the complex world we live in today! I think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children. Parents should protest and call meetings with library administrators to make sure public libraries are taking inappropriate things off the shelves for kids. Parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that may appear offensive. It will mean that they are doing their job as a good and responsible parent. Sometimes kids will not always agree with what the parent might say but they have to realize it could be what is best for them in the long run. Parents should not always want to be their child's friend because, sometimes kids would run over you if there are no clear boundaries. I know from personal experience because sometimes people can take kindness for weakness! Being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this and stand firm in your decisions. In conclusion, explicit magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids. It might expose children to somethings that is not always good for their development and well-being.
772	3749	2	3	If I had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because everybody has a right to read, listen and see whatever they want, as personal choice is fundamental. If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place; they would simply avoid it. Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books available because it would affect their children, fearing a negative influence. There would be a change in kids education if materials were restricted, limiting their access to diverse ideas. Everybody has the right to read whatever they want, which is a cornerstone of a free society. There are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things, and a library should reflect that diversity. If books would have to be removed from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out they personally disliked, leading to empty shelves. One way or another everybody ends up reading all those so-called offensive books at a certain point of their lives anyways, so sheltering them is futile. The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it directly. In my opinion I think that if parents took the time to explain to their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children, as they would have context. Another reason of why I wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids, narrowing their learning. Removing books means taking away history and important artistic works from them. There are many painters in our history that painted naked women and many people find that offensive today. I think they should never take that history from them because they are just learning things about their past and cultural heritage. Books, music, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries. Because those things are important for everybody whether you read them or not; their presence supports intellectual freedom. Removing these items would just be a total chaos and set a dangerous precedent for censorship. They should leave the libraries just the way they are, as repositories of knowledge. Everybody has the right to read, listen and see whatever they want without undue restriction.
773	3750	2	3	Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional, causing more harm than good. Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material; it is their duty to monitor consumption. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it; guide their choices. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod, a parent can take it from them as a consequence. It is not a right to have the device it is a privilege and parents are allowed to take away privileges to enforce household rules. In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically if censorship were widespread. Most media is viewed, because of the controversial or inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music that attracts audiences. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to, harming creators. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of, it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current opportunities for profit within the creative industries. Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional and violate fundamental freedoms. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press, which are vital. These offensive materials are included in this right, as the First Amendment protects unpopular expression. I understand amendments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that effectively? Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers, creating a logistical nightmare. In brief, censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the perceived benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material; education and parental guidance are.
774	3751	2	3	Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility. You are in a world of endless possibilities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section. You think to yourself how unnecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind. In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect to create a comfortable space for all. Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals that deserve respect. This censorship is not just narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well, which can be divisive. Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library to maintain a neutral environment. I do not think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there, allowing for informed choice. Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge for many people. Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life at some point. This includes children and families who visit for education and leisure. Children do not need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the mature content and material found in libraries prematurely. I do not think the books should be removed from the shelves entirely, but put somewhere else where a child could not easily find it, like a restricted section. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to at a young age. Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that same thing. This shows that it is not good for a child to see such offensive things without proper context and guidance. Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child cannot stumble upon it, is the best choice for their protection. Another reason that I believe that the books should not be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject freely. Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts in a democratic exchange of ideas. Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone else who may value it. I think that if a person so desires such material and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that willingly. Although, people who do not want to see that should also have the choice to avoid it somewhere where they will not accidentally come across it. This is why the books should not be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section for dedicated access. In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to not remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or not to see certain material they might find offensive, preserving both access and comfort. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it, catering to a wider audience. More people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone, fulfilling its role as a community resource.
775	3752	2	3	"No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that people have the right to read what they want and so do authors have the right to write what they want, expressing their ideas freely. One of the foundational principles of our country is freedom of speech, giving people the right to say and write what they want without fear of removal. People should not take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies, serving as archives of human thought. If people start to take those things away then what use would there be for a library; its purpose would be defeated. If everything deemed offensive is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library, as its collection would be gutted. This brings up the importance of the First Amendment and its guarantees. ""Freedom of speech"" means that people have the right to write what they want to, and if others find it offensive, then they simply should not read it. Also freedom of expression lets people do this too, protecting various forms of creativity. If people wish to express themselves by reading certain material then they have that right to explore different perspectives. One of my personal experiences is that I love music, and so do my two best friends, sharing discoveries. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it together, expanding our tastes. He found these bands I had never heard of and I really liked them, which was a great find. If someone found them ""offensive"" and had them removed, I would have never got to hear how good they were, missing out. This is why I believe that people should not take things out of the libraries, as it restricts access for others. Not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys a part of our cultural history for future generations. Libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information, it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderful pieces of work someone worked real hard on to create and share."
776	3753	2	3	In libraries there are a bunch of books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. to let the general public check out. This topic about censorship in libraries is a difficult one because everyone has different views on things in life. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive by someone. Being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out. In a library, someone comes across a book or a movie that seems offensive to them. That someone should just look the other way because a library is for the general public. It seems to be harsh about this, but it is not up to that person if the material in the library should or should not be in that library. The materials that are offensive to people could be in a special place in the library to accommodate everyone. Libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community. This is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries. If the whole community disagrees with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it. Yes, there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean take that material out of the library. Our country, the United States, say that everyone has the right to free speech. The United States has banned books that are offensive to certain groups, but other countries around the world might have those books in their libraries. There is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not. Someone should not have the right if a book seems offensive to that person, but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes. The libraries and the community have choices to not have an offensive book on the shelf. If it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf. Censorship is a difficult topic to argue on, as it involves balancing individual sensitivities with the collective right to access information.

Like me personally, stuff people find offensive I find it kind of humorous. And I understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of say their sexuality or ethnicity. But other than that there should be no censorship; it makes the place that is doing it seem like they are very strict and because of those strict policies it makes some people wanna go there less to get what they want and who knows, the thing you may want could be censored. And I understand that when you have a kid you don't want them to do the wrong things in life and try and keep them away from the bad stuff as long as possible. But as your child grows older he will be introduced to older/adult type material and you should cut them a break and not punish them very bad when something like that happens. From my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and I completely understand the parents point of view. Eventually people will have to let their children find out about certain things, so you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of thirteen or so that seems like a suitable age for early privileges. When it comes to taking items off a shelf some people have worse judgement than other people and that can affect everyone from their bad judgement, which is why broad censorship based on individual complaints is ultimately impractical.
778	3755	2	3	Imagine. A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person. This I could not imagine. At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouraging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are always busy participating in after school events such as: band, playing a sport, theater, choir, etc. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when I heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decision. Kids should be able to read what they want to read. As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others may not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This goes with reading as well. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novels. Some novels, more than others have a lot more graphic content such as action stories. Action stories have a lot of fighting in it. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all action movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the fantasy series. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent these movies? I do not think so. Another reason I do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is, not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, certain holiday traditions. Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in Santa Claus for many years. My cousins however, do not teach their children about Santa Claus. If I brought over a Christmas book and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of all Christmas books? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about Santa Claus does not mean that everyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about him. So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken off the shelves because: kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book is offensive and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books, what books would be left to read?
779	3756	2	3	There are many books, types of music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive to people. Should they be removed? It depends. If something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed. Today, there are many books that teach or give a bad message. If I see one, I just try to ignore it; I do not pick it up and read the back or take it home and read it. I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read. But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place. I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated PG-13 and is extremely scary. I cannot imagine watching this movie as a middle schooler; I watched it as a sophomore and was scared. I never would have thought it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No. Another area that is bad, are video games. There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and hurt people—mentally and even emotionally. You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look. Different genres of music may even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad. These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get what we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others believe it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, and listen to on a regular basis are what we think about. If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life, which is why personal discretion is more valuable than widespread censorship.
780	3757	2	3	I believe that people have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reason why I say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late 1930's about the history of the South that is used for educational purposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulgar language is offensive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds books have profanity in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed from the shelves in the library. I have had my own encounters with books that I thought were offensive; there was a book that I was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of a hate group and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and that he had picked one for tonight and were going to lynch them with the noose they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have someone in my family that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probably go out and find the people that did it and kill them. In the quote that was written by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost every book we have has something vulgar in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the possibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill from there, because there are people that can't go a day without reading a part of their book and some people have devoted three hours to reading once a day. What I'm trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have vulgar language or something offensive in them because if we tried to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything, thus defeating the very purpose of a library.
781	3758	2	3	The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive? In my opinion I dont think they should censor the material. Some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we cant control everything that offends us; it is an inevitable part of a diverse society. I do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything. People need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said in the past. Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there, not erased from our collective memory. For example, some groups of people are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a century ago. Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our past, which is a vital function of historical records. We need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places. Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future; this knowledge is crucial for progress. Why? Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries. Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons, perhaps to avoid difficult conversations? My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone. I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I dont try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it. Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you dont like or dont agree with, as that is part of living in a free and open society.
782	3759	2	3	In my opinion, I believe that if the only purpose of it is to read it then it should be in a library. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies should be one hundred percent accessible through a library mainly because many people can learn many different things in many different ways such as visual leaners which are people who learn better by looking and observing the topic. The listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them or listen to an audiobook instead of trying to read it themselves. And lastly, the readers, who can do all of the above and read, thus benefiting from the full range of materials! I know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it, providing a supportive environment for learning. but in order for that to happen, that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens that have to work their way up to being able to read, starting with picture books and audiovisual materials. I hope you understand through my point of view that access is the key. All I'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities but some people havent gotten to the reading stage yet. Why not start learning in a nice, calm, relaxing township library, where resources for all learning styles are available to foster that crucial skill.
783	3760	2	3	There are so many resaons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong. If it is violent or sexual i can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves but if the reader doesn't like the book or movie, then don't read it or watch it find something else that better suits your taste. If everyone took a book of the shelf that they didn't like then what would we have to read because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive. Every book can't be perfect for that person; what one finds dull, another may find inspiring. Everyone has there own veiws on books wether they like it or dislike it, and that diversity of opinion should be respected. If that book isn't what your looking for then put it back and stop reading it, allowing others the freedom to discover it for themselves. There have been many of people say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it'. They are excaclly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway thats going to make you mad. Then your going to complain that it is on the shelfs and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore, starting a cycle of complaint. That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive. People know what they like and don't like, so if there is something that you don't like then don't listen to it or read it; personal choice is the simple solution. It all comes down to common sence. We all have it we just need to start using it more consistently. That means if you like country music then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like so don't listen to it. Because if you listen to it then your like why is that stuff on the shevles for people to listen to it's bad for you it is puting bad thought into those teenager's heads. If eveyone sticks to doing what they like and don't worry about the other stuff then eveyone will be fine and libraries can remain comprehensive repositories of knowledge and art.
784	3761	2	3	History is bond to repeat itself right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future remains bright. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned; it is a protective measure. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up without the ability to critically filter it. The effects of what they encounter are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past from being glorified or misunderstood. The community prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read that could harm their development? I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book that depicted it in a glamorous light. This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and the girl read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. She said the book explained what guys wanted, influencing her perceptions. She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library, showing the power of media. This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up, out of immediate reach for younger audiences. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on; because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they might grab at the library that could introduce new social pressures. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too. But, my point is they should not have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool as depicted in uncensored media. By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children for a longer time, shielding them from adult complexities. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives, so the input matters greatly. Just like how a popular band has a new song out. The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube, showing the challenge of control. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding in their explicit content. These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs, by normalizing such behaviors. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them in various media forms. Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously, perhaps due to misguided influences. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we might accomplish something no one else has: a generation better prepared for responsible adulthood. To show the world that our youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright if we guide their exposure. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true by providing a curated path. If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' classic novels, or To Kill a Mockingbird,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction, through positive examples. It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully in a healthy direction. Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the vampire series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books, showing how interest can be sparked. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail, which is often portrayed in other media. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it, creating false social norms. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied, but this reality is often obscured. We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines; about celebrities who just drove around with her baby on her lap, setting a poor example. What choice are you choosing for you life? This is a question of environmental influence. In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books to ensure age-appropriate content. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way, which are pervasive in adult media. These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen, protecting their innocence. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school, if they are burdened with knowledge they cannot process. To go and learn what you already know is not the purpose; it is to learn what is appropriate for your stage of development.
785	3762	2	3	I think censorship should be allowed in the libraries because many people have diffrent oppions of what type of books they like and should read, but that does not justify removal. I don't think people should remove books or any type of materials just because of their personal dislike; individual preference is not a valid criterion for censorship. Many people think by looking a diffrent types of materials can have you look for the right imformation, as a broad collection allows for comparison and verification. I feel that if you limit the books in libraries that would be less resources to help out with the imformation that you are trying to recieve, hindering research and learning. Many people find it hard if the imformation they are wanted is not there at the local libraries, leading to frustration and incomplete understanding. Libraries should a be able to find all the books, music, movies and magazines they want and need, serving as a comprehensive source for the community. Books should never be tooking of the self but only should be allowed more on the shelves for any imformation that are needed, ensuring that knowledge remains accessible to all who seek it for whatever purpose.
786	3763	2	3	Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves this month can have a negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves. First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them. I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow. Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day. Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong. It is a natural part of their development and understanding of the world around them. Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong. Exposure to difficult topics can foster empathy and a deeper understanding of history and human nature. Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone. We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this. These materials can serve legitimate educational and professional purposes beyond mere entertainment. All in all, I understand the reasoning behind removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them.
787	3764	2	3	In this article I am going to talk about the way libraries sensor their books. I am going to hit points on what I think about the subject. But also give what point of view I feel about the books that are on these shelves. Also on the way libraries should handle this matter by pre-sensoring the books on the shelves. I will try to give details on why it does not or if it has to be taken off the shelf. I think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer eye on what their reading. But it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read. This can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading. But some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book. But you just can not for get about those books, you have to watch what they are reading. Parental guidance and involvement are crucial in these situations to help children process what they encounter. Some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme. If you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read. You just can't do this because what if another persons wants that book and they can not have it. But what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books. This I think can help with the problem. A designated section allows for access control while preserving availability for a mature audience. I feel that they could also pre-sensor these books. This will help explain things in a way they can understand it. Plus it can improve the way people feel about them books. But also they print two copies one for a more mature audiance and one for a younger one. If they do this it would make an improvement so younger kids can take this information lke a mature person does and say this is not real life. Offering age-appropriate versions can be a practical compromise for everyone involved. In my conclusion I feel like I am nuatral about the subject. I think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library. But I feell it can be prevented in the way libraries run it. Just keep a closer eye the younger audiance. Also to try and pre-sensor them to make them more friendly to the younger audiance. This balanced approach can maintain the library's role as a resource for all.
788	3765	2	3	Censorship in Libraries The library presents to the community many different things for entertainment. They's a large variety of enterianment such as: romance movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and many others. Yet they're are some that have unappropriate things. I believe that any of the things in the libraries that have unappropriate things in them should be censored or removed from the public view. If this is done it will benefit our children's moral beliefs, the library's family image, and save money for better things. Our children are the most important things to us. They are the future of our country and our world. They are the people who will be leading our country. We teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs. Yet, if they start seeing or reading unappropitate things that they can find at a library then their moral views will change. They will think that the things they see are okay in society because it's in a library. This early exposure can confuse their developing sense of right and wrong. If the library, which is thought to be one of the most educational places, has bad things then the image of the library will be thought as bad and dirty also. The library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well. Many parents won't want to take their children to the library if they know that there can be a magazine of death and murder laying out on the shelves. A tarnished reputation could lead to a decline in community patronage and support. The library would also save alot of money if they censored the things they have. Many of the pornagraphical things they have cost alot of money. Usually if they buy movies that aren't censored it cost extra. If they buy things that are approptiate they would benefit greatly. They could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price. These financial savings could then be reinvested into more educational and family-friendly resources. The library is a very important part to one's community. We need them in our lives and our children's lives also, but we won't take our children if we know that the things there aren't good for them. That's why the library need to censor the unapproptiate things so that the parents feel safe when going to the library. The library is a fun place to go, and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad. Ensuring a safe environment will encourage more families to utilize and value their local library.
789	3766	2	3	Certain books, magazines or even music contains mature or graphic nature. The music will always have ratings, just like movies. They dont need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school. Most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice. This organizational system is designed to guide patrons to content suitable for them. Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. a child should never murchase a mature level book. books, movies, and music are all the same. they are made for certain types of audiance. If a movie is rated R, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance. They are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens. The children just need to stay in there own age levels. Adherence to these existing rating systems and sections is the most effective form of management. If there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict. any parent would agree with that statement. The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries. public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups. Proper categorization and clear labeling are therefore essential for maintaining harmony and ensuring appropriate access for every patron.
790	3767	2	3	Every year, more and more books of significance to literature are being taken off of the shelves in our local libraries and classrooms. And although these books may contain some writing that is offensive now, they still have shaped the American culture today. Along with books, many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material. Just because some of these materials might contain offensive content, does not give people the right to make them out of reach and deprive the public of what they enjoy. So is it right to remove offensive material from libraries? Absolutely not. Many people enjoy books, magazines, and movies of this nature. In reality, it is more than likely hurting the library's business more than anything because these types of materials is what our culture is all about. People don't want to read about what's happening at the animal shelter across the street. They want to read about what's going on in the world and about the hottest trends for seasons. All in all, removing these materials will only hurt the library's popularity and the amount of customers they attract. Artists write about what they love and how they feel. How can someone tell an author of a book that his or her writing is too graphic or too offensive? That is what he or she chose to write about! That is how he or she expresses themselves through their writing! By 'frowning upon' books, magazines or songs with certain offensive content, officials diminish the creativity and uniqueness of authors. If a certain author or artist has a really great, original idea for a new song or book, but is worried about it not being carried by libraries because it is a little offensive, then obviously that author or artist is not going to write that book or song. By removing offensive books, songs and movies, we the public are being robbed of creative and imaginitive writing. All in all, the removal of offensive books, magazines, movies, and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves. Generations might never even hear of 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' just because it uses racial terms. So what would you do if put in this situation? Keep or remove? The choice to preserve our literary heritage, despite its complexities, is crucial for a well-informed and culturally literate society.
791	3768	2	3	In this persuasion essay, it will talk about the content of whether we should or should not not remove all offensive books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelf. In this essay, everyone will agree with the content or be on the opposing side of the argument. It is not an exception that this essay will disagree with some of the viewing audience; however, there are situations in which the audience can see both sides of the issue. To begin with, on the matter of whether we should or should not remove offensive books, music, magazines, or movies from the library, I do not believe that all content should be removed for all to see. In some cases there are exceptions, but banning all material does not seem logical. In my point of view, the complete removal of materials seems a little extreme; however, putting the content on a higher shelf seems more practical instead of removing it all for good. Yes, it might be offensive, but in this time period, offensive movies, books, and magazines are often looked at as more comedical and not taken seriously. For example, a really offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is considered really offensive, and yet people just see it as entertaining. This show can be offensive to everyone, but yet we still watch it. In this show there is a warning label stating it should only be seen by children @NUM1 and older. Parents are advised and should acknowledge what their kids are seeing. It is not the creator of the content who should be banned; rather, it is the job of a parent to be mindful of what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to, not the creator's job. In which case, there is no clear right answer in this subject. However, the creators of the content see it as a way to vent about their lives, experiences, and the obstacles they had to face, or just to make people laugh. They see it as a safe way to express themselves. It might be offensive to you, but for some people, that is their life. You might not like it or it @MONTH1 seem harsh for you, but that is real life. Secondly, there is always something that @MONTH1 offend you, but it does not seem logical to ban it. An example might be religion. A religion a person follows might offend you. It does not mean that if the religion is offensive it will get banned or be removed for everyone. Your religion @MONTH1 offend someone, but they deal with it and embrace the differences. If your friend has a different religion, it does not mean you will never talk to them ever again. Thirdly, you might express yourself and there are going to be people out there that will not agree with you. You might create a book, a song, or a movie that will offend someone in some way. For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some guys and girls. There is a disagreement between two girls fighting over which character is better for @CAPS4. There is always an opposing side. A @CAPS2 might be tired of hearing about @CAPS5 all the time and might find it offensive when a girl @MONTH1 compare him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1, saying why cannot boys be like them, but even then they do not remove @CAPS3 all together. For you it might seem the greatest movie ever, or the most terrible movie in the universe. Fourthly, another example is a @CAPS8 show called '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (Queen of the South) where a woman who had nothing to begin with ended up being the most wanted in some countries. Some people @MONTH1 think that it might be cool to be just like her. It does not seem that people will go out there and do what she does because the television show displays all of the consequences that exist if you do what she did. This show is an example of what could happen if you become exactly like her. Some offensive material @MONTH1 teach a lesson and can prevent a person from doing something that they @MONTH1 later regret. In conclusion, everything in our life offends us in some way. It does not matter what it is; we deal with it and our life goes on. There is no single way to see this issue, but one thing you enjoy may be offensive to others. It would not seem fair to take something you enjoy just because it offended one person. So I believe that library censorship is not at risk. In my opinion, everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or even listen to, and also have the choice to stop reading it, watching it, or listening to it.
792	3769	2	3	My views are that if material is offensive to someone or other people, the certain material should not be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent or guardian if the material is explicit. For example, in a store where you buy CDs, games, etc., you have to be of age to buy the material; that should be the same with books. Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1'; it should not be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject of not judging a book by its cover. Just because the name is not to someone's standards should not matter. Pick the book up, read the back, and see what it is actually about. Then, if it is what you were expecting it to be, talk to someone who is in charge and explain to them what the problem is in your case. Also, you could always have a section of the store or library just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actually help out a lot. There are tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as romance books; they talk about love and passion in ways that are very inappropriate for children. If there was a section of a store or library for adults, it could help keep these things out of your children's or other children's minds. You or anyone else would not have to worry about children picking certain material up that you would not want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time you are in a library and you see something you would not like for your children to see or read for themselves.
793	3770	2	3	Censorship is a very sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censorship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored. Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another. No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by. Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1; the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens. Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive. Some citizens @MONTH1 argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless. There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually. We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the First Amendment, then we need to fight back against censorship and remove it completely from our society to protect our fundamental rights.
794	3771	2	3	Libraries everywhere might have a book or two that @MONTH1 be offensive to a reader. I have not found a book offensive to my readings just yet. Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. It is going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines, etc., from the library. Music in the library is good because you cannot find old music like from the @DATE1's in a typical music store. If someone finds music offensive in the library, it might be because they do not know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I am sure there is a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they would not be so offended. Magazines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magazines that have interesting facts about what happened or what is going to happen. For example, @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest events or something big that happened, all in that one @ORGANIZATION1. Then there are advertisements; how would people get money if they did not put their advertisement in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy their product? If not, nobody would buy the products. Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the library you can find at a Blockbuster or Walmart. It is because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual and prefer the movie version, so they also read the books. Overall, I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and do not change the way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offended by already, so it is already too late for that. But it is going to take more than one person to be against removal. So that is my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library.
795	3772	2	3	I believe that everyone has their own opinion on what is appropriate and what is not. You cannot @CAPS4 take a couple of people and ask their opinion because everyone is different; we all have our own rights to know books and what the author really wanted us to learn or hear about. Like I said, everyone is different; if you @CAPS6't want your @CAPS1 to read it, tell your @CAPS1 why and explain it to them. @CAPS6't make the rest of the @CAPS1 suffer. I believe some parents need to look at our ancestors; they were not even allowed to have dreams and thoughts of their own. Why would we want our @CAPS1 to go through the same thing they had to? @CAPS1 @CAPS2 everyone should have a right to look, to read, and to listen to whatever makes them happy. So what if it has vulgar language in it; get over it or @CAPS6't listen to it at all. Would you want someone telling you that your life story, for example, was crummy and they did not like the way you worded things? That is the way you talk because it is your life story. The way I see it is let our children of this generation learn all they can about the bad stuff so they can stay away from it, and also inform them of the good stuff in life so they will not always be in fear. Let the children read whatever they want to read. So what if they curse; tell your @CAPS1 that it is bad language. @CAPS6't get rid of good books, movies, and music just (@CAPS3:) @CAPS4 because the author has a different view on life than yours. Open your @CAPS5, and @CAPS6't be so shallow in your thinking about these important matters.
796	3773	2	3	If you are sitting in the library and you are minding your own business doing your homework and studying for a test next hour, I wouldn't thank you would want to be messed with. Would you? Well, I'm going to explain what I think about everything that's in the libraries. Like some stuff we should have in there and some stuff we shouldn't. I believe you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a library. There are some things in the world today that a lot of people find offensive. There are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area where you live that are really offensive. When it comes to our libraries there are some things that need to be changed and some things that don't need bothered. There are some books some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries but to other people might enjoy them. But I don't believe that they should be taken off the shelf. They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to them easy. You wouldn't like for some books taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids. They just need to be moved to a shelf where only bigger kids can get to. When I am studying I like to listen to music. It helps me think what I am going and calms me down. But when I don't have my music playing I don't like when other people have theirs too loud. That's one thing that need to be changed in the libraries. Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf. Another thing that has been a problem is magazines. There are a lot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched. I believe if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf. Some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people. If they don't somebody might take it the wrong way and it could get bad. Ultimately, it is about finding a balance that respects everyone's needs in a shared community space like the library.
797	3774	2	3	I disagree that certain material, books, movies, or magazines should be removed that are offensive to some from the shelves of libraries. There are three reasons why I argue this topic. One reason is that books, music, etc. that are inappropriate should not be in a section that a child would go and look for a book. A second reason is that for a child to check-out a book and the book is inappropriate, they should have identification to show that they are of age. The third reason I think that things like that should stay on shelves is because adults have books, movies, music, etc. for them for many reasons. There should be nothing inappropriate in a library that a child can get a hold of. A child should only have things appropriate that they can grab so parents do not have to be worried about the things their child hears, sees, or reads. There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book, and let the child check the book or magazine out. This is where the problem begins. All libraries should identify each child when they check-out a book, magazine, or music. That is why movies are rated, so that a parent could know what kind of movie they're going to be watching. A parent should keep a close eye on what their child reads or sees. I think that things inappropriate should stay on shelves, but I also think it should stay in the adult section of the library. Children should not be able to go in the section for the adults. The inappropriate things on the shelves could be useful for the adults in some cases. There are some material that an adult might need to help in life, such as for research or for understanding complex topics. In conclusion, children should not be able to get a hold of inappropriate material in a library, all libraries should identify someone for the inappropriate material, and adults should be able to have this type of material on shelves in libraries for their own use and benefit.
798	3775	2	3	If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone? In my opinion, I believe that there are some references, considering movies, books, music, magazines, and more, that are inappropriate. However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves because they are offended by it. If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left. In my mind, everything could possibly be offensive to someone. For example, I read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like everyone else does. The way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible. Considering I've been a big time cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all. After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it. I wasn't going to go back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it. My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you. I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies aren't always the only ones that come across them. For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inappropriate languages or scenes. That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you. Or parents, censor what your children see, hear and read about. Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf. Those authors or creators worked just as hard as anyone else. Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else. In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people. I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it. It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and hard work. Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but welcome to the real world. They just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do.
799	3776	2	3	Without books we all would not know what we know now. It's just like saying without a heart your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything. Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else might not know, and or understand. The same thing goes for music, movies, and magazines. I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also someone else is thinking different then they are. Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it may be. They also help you get a better meaning of a lot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music, and magazines. But some tell you what age it is suitable for. For movies they tell you things like ratings and other things like that. Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it. Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child. Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it may be. You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do. Just to better themselves as an individual. People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever may seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change. Those things are there for a reason if you don't like it then try a better way to get away from it. Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to picture all that being taken away. It's not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability. They all are there for a reason, and that reason is to educate, inform, and sometimes even to entertain us through different phases of life.
800	3777	2	3	Materials that are offensive for some people in my point of view should not be removed from the shelves. If some people are offended by materials they shouldn't pay any mind to those certain materials. If everybody paid attention to offensive entertainment regardless to what kind, people would be upset all the time. There are many things people see, hear, and read about that might be offensive. Don't take everything seriously most of those offensive things might just be a joke or just someone trying to get attention. When you just sit and think about it, most television shows you would watch everyday might have at least one moment that's says something offensive. In example I watch a television show some nights that says something racial about certain groups. I don't pay the show any kind of attention because I know it's a show their just trying to get more rating. So when it really comes down to it I am going to be watching the same show again the next night. What if some of our most historical people had listened to everything that everyone else said about them. Then, our black culture and history wouldn't be so rich today. I probably wouldn't be able to take this test that I'm doing right now. So don't take everything so serious everyone has some type of humor. If we removed everything that was offensive today, some of your favorite actors and singers wouldn't be the famous actors or singers you love and respect today. All of the grammy's and award shows that we watch on television would not be themselves. There are all kinds of different genre of music. Some of the words that different artists use would be offensive but they still release those same songs because they're only words. My conclusion, is that anything and anyone can be offended or offensive. People don't take everything serious because it might just be a joke or some ignorant person that needs attention. When I was younger my mother always said 'sticks and stones may break your bones but words only make you stronger'. So don't take everything serious I mean it's only the media, tell me who does take them seriously all the time anyway.
801	3778	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed. It would really help society. Here are some ways how. All books are different. Some @MONTH1 have offensive language. If books have offensive language you don't have to read it out loud. You can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened. Some books say sexual things in them that @MONTH1 offend a race of some type or a gender. If books are sexual for your age group then I would recommend choosing a new book. But no matter how you look at it, it could always be much worse than what it is. Music definitely needs to have some censorship on that. When you're listening to the radio or a cd or ipod, you can't always censor that. The radio companies need to do a better job at censoring them out of songs. Many young teens think it's cool to use vulgar language. Movies have different ratings for different age groups. I'm sure no one would let a two year old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie. That kid would have nightmares for a week. So censorship would really help the parents out on choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one that they have no clue about. Magazines are nothing but gossip. Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad in people or the good in them. There should be some censorship in there because it is a person's life who they're talking garbage about. Some say kids are like sponges. Whatever the kid hears he will repeat. Whatever a kid sees he will try to repeat it. So whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same. Things do need a little censorship. If we didn't have that it's hard telling what the world would be like. The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation what so ever and if we take things away then the world would have nothing to do. I know that when I was a little kid I would hear something on the radio and think it was cool to say. My parents wouldn't know what to do to me. I know as an adult I wouldn't want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age. Therefore, implementing sensible censorship is a necessary step for a better society.
802	3779	2	3	No I don't think that should happen; that would be stupid and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it. One reason is because adults like all of that stuff. And if they were doing this because kids keep getting into them, then just get a door that says @NUM1 and older and put cameras up. If kids' parents complain then at least you can say that it's all in one room and no kids allowed. This shouldn't be a big deal; if you're a kid you are going to have to be around all that stuff when you grow up. So you might as well get used to it. It is a big deal if you're cursing all the time but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff. When I was growing up I was around all that stuff and I think I turned out all right. The key is to provide guidance, not to remove everything from sight, because exposure in a controlled way is part of growing up.
803	3780	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, I do think that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because some students read books on a daily basis and reading also keeps some students out of trouble. The reason I say that is because if you find a book you might be interested in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with your younger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also, some books that are offensive show students to not do the things they see in the book. Some books that are offensive show how people that do bad things have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people's mistakes. Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn't have to pay that cost from doing something wrong. Also music can be offensive because of the cursing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2. The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and take action in a certain way. The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside and some music have bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things. Most of the time music can make you happy and you can understand a lot in life just by listening to music. Music is a description of life meaning that life is full of offensive things but you have to be very self-centered to understand. Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies. The titles in the movie can also be offensive but that doesn't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story. Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine. Some magazines show appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also there are different things like activities and things for family and friends to enjoy. Many magazines are different in their own way @CAPS2 depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magazine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career. There are a lot of things that can be offensive in the world but you have to learn how to separate yourself from the negative things in life. Also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we hear in these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen to what the magazines and movies are telling you because you have a mind of your own. People don't listen to what the books and etc, are going by because some of the things they are talking about is false information. So that's why I say @CAPS7 I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Sincerely, @ORGANIZATION1.
804	3781	2	3	Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it. Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place. In a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you aren't going to find a book that is inappropriate for your own age. You @MONTH1 find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it. Men and women go to public libraries to learn. If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't be able to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. Is that fair? You tell me. In a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. In a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. In an elementary children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library. In a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on around them. In a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please. Magazines are a different subject. A lot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alcoholic beverages. Those types of magazines should not be able to be read in a school library. In a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases. In the end I'm saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should. Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth by removing access to information for everyone else.
805	3782	2	3	People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into. If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturity on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that there will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on there it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear. Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but since the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be allowed to watch it, then it's saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it. We should be happy that we can have some control over what our children watch and listen to. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'm @CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find an old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can and trust the systems we have in place.
806	3783	2	3	Does censorship really help or setback our libraries? Does it try to mask what really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. Its all in perspective. Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a diaster. In one book that we read this year in my English class was 'Fahrenheit 451'. This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the country. Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen? Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in English class at school, were mostly about womens rights and African American history. Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias. If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left? And for that matter, my best friend is an African American girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so what is the big deal with living in the past? Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it? Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of 'what about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them. Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain. All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form. Children should not be dissillusioned on what the world is and could be. Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other.
807	3784	2	3	In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make. Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the Constitution. In the United States, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our Constitution as the first ten admendments to the Constitution. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the Constitution and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the United States. By violating the Constitution openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the Constitution. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the Constitution as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the Constitution, the United States is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society. The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the American public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began. Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel 'Fahrenheit 451' by Ray Bradbury, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out The Holy Bible or the Declaration of Independence. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society. Although censorship may seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the Constitution of the United States. So let us hope that all though we may play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where.
808	3785	2	3	I think everything should be there. The examples of things that should be there are: all magazines, books, and internet service. For the magazines there should be all cars, trucks, atvs, mtvs, utvs, espn, golf, game informers, and wwe magazines. Now for the books. All the types of of books that should be allowed are science-fiction, fantasy, mystery, horror, comedy, and history books. And last the internet service. The internet service sould be used for school work, to play all games on any website, and to use youtube on any computer. This all should be used there because certin things some kids don't have at home, and the library should be a place where they can access these materials and services freely.
809	3786	2	3	'Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest. Wheather that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is. I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it. This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast!! There are to many people making enimies all over the world. I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too. If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it. There are multiple solutions to the problem. The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with. Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out!! I also hope they people make the right vote. Im not saying that my vote is the only way, its just my opinion. Either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy. So thank you very much for letting me voice my opinion!
810	3787	2	3	I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults. I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to. I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d. or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book. Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly. If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission. I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were eighteen years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit to ensure their protection.
811	3788	2	3	Throughout my life, I have seen many books that seem offensive to me. However, they should not be censored just because they seem offensive. I believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored. A reason why I think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person, may not be offensive to another. Classifying something as offensive is an opinion, a subjective judgment that varies from one individual to the next. Unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive, it should be able to remain open to the public. Another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our country, we are given the right to express ourselves freely. If we censored books that are found to be offensive, we would be violating this fundamental right. This would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them. The next reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is that if we were to censor every book that we found offensive, we would not have any books to read at all. Books that some people like are found offensive by others. For example, suppose a few people loved the popular book series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored. The people who loved the series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them. If this continued, we would have no books to read, creating a barren literary landscape. Another reason why I believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books, we would never learn from terrible mistakes. Suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read. Sooner or later, no one would remember what terrible things happened and history could possibly repeat itself. Unless having books that seem offensive is worse than having the events we dread happen again, then books that are found offensive should not be censored. I believe books that are found to be offensive should not be censored because without them, we would be violating the right to freely express ourselves and we would be allowing terrible things that happened in the past to be forgotten. Without books that are considered offensive, we would not have any books to read at all, and our society would be poorer for it.
812	3789	2	3	They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back of the library is enough censorship. You have to look at it in the publishers view also. They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled upon something they believe is offensive. We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like certain magazine racks. Things that show inappropriate pictures, drugs, firearms, etc. I believe they are already censored enough. Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or sectioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their children flipping through the pages corrupting their minds. Some material are even put in a plastic sleeve so the person must purchase it before reading, which is a reasonable compromise. If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in a free society. I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials. Offensive or not we have the right to publish and promote it, and that principle should be upheld.
813	3790	2	3	I don't think they should publicly exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library receives constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it. So what I'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other than a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existent. I don't think that librarians will intentionally put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times I've been I don't think I have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable. The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem, as a balanced approach respects both access and community concerns.
814	3791	2	3	I think that everyone has different views on different things so I don't think that they should be censored because if they would be that would be against the first amendment where it says everyone have the freedom of religion and speech. If you disagree with the book or whatever it may be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it. People these days are taking things way to far with their opinions. People need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them. There several billion people in the world and every person looks at thing slightly different and this should be taken into consideration when they get mad just because there is a book or movie on the shelf of the library. For example I like movies with comedy and sometimes a scary movie but girls may not like scary movies and might like movies with drama or something in that line. Just because we like different things doesn't mean we should have to put just a so certain kind of books or movies on the shelf. Yes, there are movies that I don't like because they stand for things that are against my religion but I don't stand around and say no one should watch these movies because just because I don't believe in them doesn't mean I should judge other people for it. I know some people feel that everyone one should look at things the same way as they do and everyone should should agree and get along but that is not how it is and no matter how much you want people to agree and get along it will never happen. I think people need to mind their own business and let people read, listen to, and watch whatever they want to and it should not offend anyone. I know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts. People like this you can argue with and you will never win the argument and you can never get them to understand how you look at it. They just think think my way is the right way and the only way. This is the way I feel about people getting mad when there is a book or movie on the shelf that they do not agree with. I just think that everyone should try to understand what you are saying and listen to you instead of ignoring you. I feel this way but I am not a person that is stuck in their ways where you cant change their mind, and I believe mutual respect is the key.
815	3792	2	3	I believe that if something is found offense to someone then it doesn't mean its offense to someone else. In libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different type of things may come across as offense to some but others might enjoy it. Therefore it shouldn't be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things. Some things such as adult novels and explicit music are things people consider to be offensive. But what they don't understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right. Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas. Everyone is not the same, and our tastes reflect that diversity. If you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your interest. If the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. Its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people don't like it or find it offensive, which limits the very purpose of a library. Lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion. But so are those that believe that these things are good. There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities and preferences. Everyone has a right to say whether they don't like something. But what you don't like someone else does. So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust and goes against the spirit of a free and open society.
816	3793	2	3	A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves. Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. However, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they often offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves! Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Indeed, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries. By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music. Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Frankly, that is a nieve comment as well as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved. In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as well. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society.
817	3794	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries? There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines. I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about. I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best. Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way.
818	3795	2	3	In the quote that Katherine Paterson wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provokative. This is a very interesting quote. She talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it. In everyday life there are things that are said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear or read. Some movies can be way too provokative. Directors try and cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across. Some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it. People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over. When parents get movies they try and keep those scenes hidden from their children. The parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying. To many children take the movies to the extreme and try and act like the actors or actresses, and the children end up getting hurt from these actions. Music is especially one to do this. There are not a lot of songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content in it. Many parents do not want them to be exeposed to that way to soon. If people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said. Mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to. That is not a mothers dream to go and do that. There are too many magazines that try and expose women. They use this to try and see more magazines. This is wrong to do. A little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her, this is just wrong. Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea. When girls look at a model in a magazine they try and be just like the model. They girls end up being underweight, sick, and maybe do drugs. Parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve. Some parents let their kids get away with too much. They should censor what their children do. Some kids will try and get around them so there is not helping them. Everyones point of view is different. People might think that this scene is to provocative and another person might look at that and say there is nothing wrong. It just depends on how society feels about the whole situation. If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf.
819	3796	2	3	Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world. They contain many different styles and genres of books. Some might not be appropriate for young children to read. There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves. I believe that no book should be denied of this right. Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times. Most libraries have children sections. Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section. So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway. Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them. Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child. Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library. If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not. Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like. They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off. If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves. The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly. People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not. Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent. There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing. Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen. Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen. Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read. Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.
820	3797	2	3	Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of today less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in today's society. Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies. Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society. The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media.
821	3798	2	3	How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone in a book, or kept hearing bad words from a song that was available in the library! Would you really want that for your child? I always thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, I didn't know it was becoming a bad place to be. People have their own opinions in everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to many people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others! Some people do like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat of a song, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is because their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had years ago, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people loose than interest in them unless they think its cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things! Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their business. Young kids these days are being exposed to a lot of more things that they should'nt be! What little kids already know is sickening! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of five! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's right! Kid's are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know! Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture. People should have id's that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but its worth a try! The world is'nt a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in God or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects their actions and thought! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! dont be a follower because it's not going to get you anywhere in life! Everything counts, and we must protect our children from this harmful content.
822	3799	2	3	I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive. The books and media help the human race sympathize with each other and know about things that already happened so that we don't repeat history and do it all over again. Some books are made up for entertainment and others are for education and help children learn about what happened in the past, like wars and great discoveries. Taking books off the shelves of schools and libraries would be uncalled for because you are taking away from children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and knowing what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms. Books that are offensive should be taken off the shelves but not the books that make sense to people and help you succeed in life, such as classic literature and historical texts. Some schools don't have books to read because they are in a poor country and don't have much to do besides go to school and learn. Books are important in so many ways that it would be a lot of drama if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who done it. Some books don't make sense but that doesent matter if it does or don't, as they still offer a perspective worth considering. The fundamental role of books in education and empathy cannot be replaced, and their removal would be a great loss for society.
823	3800	2	3	In todays world there are so many movies and books that it's hard to watch or read all of them. They all have different looks and ideas. Every one in the world is not all going to like all of the same movies, books, and music we all have different tastes. That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf. I think they make so many different types of everything because we do have different beliefs like religion, class, and culture. Music, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on. And if you just take it off the shelf because someone somewhere thought it was offensive we would not have music or any thing like that. I don't really have too many thing that I get offended by but I do know that I have seen some shows that were that way and some people I'm guessing thought was funny. Books, there are many different genres in that too just like music so if it has a bad word, or a rude anecdote some people might not like it. Books are good to read. It would be bad if they were all gone. Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything. Take for an example The Bible is one of the most read books in the world and if they just took it off the shelf because some people don't believe in it so many things would change and religions are not going to be the same in any way. That is the way is going to be with it all and most people do take offense to that. The way I put it in my head is that if they don't like it they don't have to read, watch, or listen to it. Every thing in all of these businesses is in taking a risk. Its all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc. So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad choice for this. That is why we have our own free will and and make the choice that you want to good or bad, right or wrong. You might not think about it much but thing like this do happen it might not be in your town but some where out there in the world it will be happening, and we must defend the freedom to choose what we consume.
824	3801	2	3	There are some certain materials I think is offensive to children is books, music, movies and even magazines. Books have a lot of materials unsafe for children because they can get a hold to adult books and other unsafe materials that are not suitable for their age. Another thing is music, and even music videos has a lot of profanity in them which can influence a child's behavior. Movies such as horror movies some children might watch them and reflect what they have watched on tv, leading to nightmares or fear. The next thing is magazines, which has material such as inappropriate pictures in them that's why they should take the books, music, movies and magazines off the shelf to protect young minds. It is the responsibility of the community to ensure that children are not exposed to content that could harm their development and innocence.
825	3802	2	3	How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority might find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics and limit the diversity of available information. My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person. People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others. Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develop a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present and protected as a fundamental freedom.
826	3803	2	3	Should we remove books and media because they are offensive? I do not believe so. In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way. The word offensive is a controversial word, and its meaning is not fixed or universal. Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting? Many people see many different things as offensive based on their own personal sensibilities and upbringing. Many of the books today's youth read are considered 'offensive' to older generations. That is because today's standards are different from those of the past. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed and subjective word. If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children and guide them accordingly. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people, which highlights the diversity of human perspective. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it; we all have the power to choose what we consume. So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person.
827	3804	2	3	In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be removed or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable. In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate for younger audiences. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books often have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual gestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin. There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassette tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on. Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's a celebrity on the front page with no hair, or a fashion magazine's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents may not want their kids being exposed to such actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottery. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely. People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple.
828	3805	2	3	Censorship in libraries! Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and if something is offensive to one person it may not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about something; that's why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc. available for different tastes. If you take out the 'offensive' things, you might cause offense to another person who valued that material. People just need to stop being selfish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests and perspectives on what is acceptable.
829	3806	2	3	Many people, after reading a book, listening to a song, watching a movie or reading a magazine have found themselves upset or disturbed by that piece of media and feel that it should be removed from the shelf they found it on. I feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines or media. My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It depends on that person's background, religion and personal beliefs. I do not think that books, magazines or media should have to be banned from library shelves just because that particular person finds that piece of material offensive. If they find it so disturbing then they should discontinue reading that book or magazine, or listening to that song. One person should not be able to make the choice of keeping a certain book or magazine on the shelf because somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive. The partial point of writing a book or song is to express one's opinion of a topic and if the reader or listener does not approve of their opinion, then they should respect that director or author's thoughts and move on. If a library or media center contains inappropriate books, magazines or movies, they should create special areas or shelves to keep such material. This area could be created for adult or mature readers, viewers or listeners. I also think that books and other pieces of media of such inappropriateness should have a label regarding its offensive or explicit content. If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing; I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public and that there are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hand, that may not know about its possible offensiveness. If warning signs are shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed. If such measures are taken, I think they will keep all readers, viewers and listeners pleased.
830	3807	2	3	Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying views as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is very offensive to one person may not be offensive to someone else, it is all a matter of personal values and beliefs. Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which may not be appropriate for everyone. I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie; they can simply choose to avoid it. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people. I do believe, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are clearly sorted, people are less likely to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not wish to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help keep children away from unwanted material through designated sections. To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different views, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left for anyone to enjoy.
831	3808	2	3	I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading, given their developing minds. I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects, offering perspectives we might not otherwise encounter. Though books with this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is their culture and how they live, representing their reality and experiences. What would happen if every book that was considered offensive was actually removed from book shelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial, challenging my preconceived notions. The eye-opening world of these books is amazing, providing a window into lives unlike my own. The fact that I can read about other peoples life, and their everyday struggle is astounding to me, fostering a deeper sense of empathy. If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion, then our world would be a mess, with a narrow and homogenous collection of ideas. Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read? I want to read something that is going to grab my attention, and make me want to keep reading, something that provokes thought and feeling. I do not think that I would have that type of experience if these books were removed, leaving only the safest and most sanitized texts behind.
832	3809	2	3	I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intolerance instead of understanding. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning, serving as pillars of a free society. Censorship stops these things from occurring, stifling intellectual growth. If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period, which is a detriment to literacy. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading; it can be a challenge to engage them. If there is a book that a reluctant reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Because he or she finds it offensive? Because he or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship, which should not be based on personal dislike. Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time, as societal values evolve. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Fahrenheit 451. To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn were censored because of the racist language used by certain characters. This language helps to set the time period in the novels, providing historical context. Also, To Kill a Mockingbird is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in the South. The main antagonist is an ignorant, racist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villain of the story; it actually argues powerfully against racism. Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent, which is a matter of age-appropriateness. Preventing a child from seeing a rated R movie or reading a letter to Playboy is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well, exploring more complex themes. If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then he or she will not be his or her own person, lacking independent thought. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood, leaving them unprepared for the real world. They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them, unable to think critically. John Milton said, 'He who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' This is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better, but into conformists. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently, developing into well-rounded individuals. These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance and empathy. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people, leaving a void. Anyone is capable of possessing them, if given the chance. Censorship cannot be seen as the norm in a society that values freedom. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow, which is a fundamental right. That is the purpose of the institution of education, to enlighten and empower. Therefore, censorship should not even be considered as a viable option. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries, ensuring a future of informed and independent citizens.
833	3810	2	3	I think that libraries should not remove material such as books, music, movies, or magazines. I think that libraries should keep them because there are a lot of people that have their own style of reading and entertainment preferences. Sometimes I will go to the library and get a book, then I will go look at magazines, movies, and music; it offers a variety of media. There are a lot of movies out right now, and now you can go check them out for free, which is a great service. Music is the same way, offering a vast selection for different tastes. I feel like if there is stuff in the library that kids like they should go for it, as it encourages them to visit and learn. I'm sure that they have educational books, movies and magazines, but entertainment also has its place. If people take out stuff that kids and teens like, such as popular movies or music, some of them might not return back to the library, losing a valuable resource. There are a lot of students that listen to music and watch movies too, and the library can serve their needs. I love checking out movies from the libraries; its easy and they always have the movies that you are looking for, from classics to new releases. The movies are easy to find and its quick, making it a convenient service. However, if the music has some offensive stuff in it, then perhaps they should consider taking it off the shelves because it will have people thinking, why would they put a movie, music, magazines and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public? This could create a negative environment. In conclusion, I hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves, after careful consideration. It would bring more people in and they would have more respect for those people making the decisions. The public wouldn't have to worry about picking up a book that has a lot of stuff that their kids do not need to see, read, or listen to, ensuring a family-friendly space. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books and more, creating a comfortable environment for all. I really hope the people make the right choice for the community they serve.
834	3811	2	3	Nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone at some point, as offense is often subjective. Most of the people that offend others do it on purpose in their music, books, or movies, intending to provoke a reaction. While some other people accidentally offend people by the way they worded something, with no malicious intent. If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still available for others, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know they're not the only one offended, which provides a measured response. When someone gets offended by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation of the offensive material they seen or heard, moving it to a different section. In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music, preserving access. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else, who may find value in it. A book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted on to be removed or stay in the library, allowing for a democratic process. This way the material has a chance to be available in the future, rather than being removed by a single complaint. Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censored version so it is suitable for the people that were not offended, offering a compromise. In some cases there is only one person that got offended by something that was in a library, representing a minority view. In these cases the person could choose to wait until someone else is offended by the material to speak up about its offensiveness, ensuring the concern is shared. If material is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace, considering the greater good. If relocated the material is still available to other people who seek it out. When voted on it could stay or be removed based on community standards. Someone can speak up about the offensive material after someone else finds it offensive as well, creating a more compelling case for review.
835	3812	2	3	If I think that something is offensive then yes, it should be removed from the bookshelves, to protect people from harm. The library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people; it should be a welcoming space for all. If something offended you then you wouldn't want someone else of the same race, religion, or family to read it and be offended, causing them pain. Yes, we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want, but I think it should only go so far and then should be stopped when it becomes hateful. Someone can only take so much hurtful language, and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good, leading to distress. If somebody were to write about the blacks and saying they are all dumb just because they are black, then the blacks would not just stand around and do nothing; such content is deeply damaging. After you call someone names or pick on them so much it scars them for life and it could hurt their whole communication skills for the rest of their life, affecting their self-esteem. Not everyone but some even take it so far as hurting themself or others, which is a tragic potential outcome. So if I seen a book on the bookshelves of the public library that offended me then yes, I would want it to be removed so it doesn't offend anybody else and cause similar pain. I don't think that hurting someone's feelings is worth messing up their whole life or causing them to hurt themself; prevention is important. If something hurt you or offended you would you just let it happen or would you use the rights that we are given and try to make it right and not hurt anyone else? Taking action is a responsibility. Would you want someone writing about you in a mean way? You would probably try to make it right and have it stopped. If you could fix something and didn't just because you didn't feel like it and it continued to offend other people then not only is it the persons fault that wrote it but I could see it kinda being your fault for letting that person still hurt people through inaction.
836	3813	2	3	Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library? My belief is no because many people in today's society are pretty offensive themselves and the books are meant to show the life of fiction or fact and when you do censor something the other person will try his or her best to try and find an uncensored version of the same material. Art books are another thing that should not be censored because the artist is not trying to be perverse or offensive he or she is just trying to show his vision of art in the form he or she feels people would find artistic. Censorship is important in some ways but you also have to have an opened mind because someone who finds something offensive might not feel that way later on in their life, as perspectives can change with time and experience. So my belief is don't censor something because it might offend some, because there are many who probably don't take offense to it be it books, music, videos, video games, writing, or movies. We are all going to have a democracy over if something should or shouldn't be appropriate, allowing for a collective decision rather than an individual one. So what are your thoughts censor a book because of it's content or leave it and let the people decide? My thoughts would be censorship is moral but you also have to think it would be immoral to take a book away from a reader that might find this book interesting and valuable. So please don't censor books from our public library, we need books that have facts or fiction in them but also have a great story in it's words. My other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended, placing the power of choice in their hands.
837	3814	2	3	I think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful. Then you should have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out. The reason why i say @NUM1 is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong AND you can handle it if is wrong. I mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it. It would be differnt if some one waz but no one is. Some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @MONTH1 make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. BECAUSE ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it, since every individual has unique sensitivities. If you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @NUM3 ask for @PERSON1 and we can talk bout it and mabe you @MONTH1 be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do. The reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @NUM1 to check out surten books. If ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you. There is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff, and they rely on libraries for this access. What i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem i got. I mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find BUT some say that they have work and they dont. They just want to get out of class and not do work. People go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games, which is a separate issue from book content. But as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people like them being there for them to enjoy and learn from.
838	3815	2	3	In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more. Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages. I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read. It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads, fostering a sense of personal responsibility. Let us start with books. There are many different types of books. From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires. How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though? The answer is simple. When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself. It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book, based on your own judgment and comfort level. Movies guidelines are along the same pattern. Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth. When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating. If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not, exercising your own discretion. Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books. If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian. Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation. Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director. The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone. If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't, and their access should be respected. There are many books, movies, magazines, etc. out in the world. Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive. There are many other choices that are 'okay'. So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like, allowing everyone to find materials that suit their own tastes and values.
839	3816	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? Well i think that they they should be put to a vot for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide. That some might not find it offensieve as others do. No because people have different beleafs than others. I think they should be put to a vote for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide because the staff might think its morally incorrect and morally offensive. But others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff. The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do, so they shouldn't have sole authority. Some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently. No one person thinks the same reson unless they have been told what another person thinks. the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason. Weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life, and that lesson can be valuable to different people. No because people have different beleafs then others. In one culter that book might be aloud and they might live around that library. So that would make then miss out on going to the library for books. For example, if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers. Their business would fall, and the community would be poorly served. The library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money, which could create a conflict of interest. So my answer is no because they shuld put it to a vote, some might not find it as offensive as others do, and people have different beleafs than others do. No one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible, and a democratic process is the fairest way to handle such subjective matters.
840	3817	2	3	Dear editor, I feel that we should not take any movies, books, and music off the self. I mean realy it will start confliced. Then we have law suight. I have seen what happens when you take a book off the self. the people start yelling because they did not find it offending. Then they say that they are going to suw. Last it costs mouney to go to corght, which is a waste of resources for everyone involved. I have also seen what happens when u take music off the self. people yell at first. Then they start to get vilent. Know you have a mob of people destoyinh your store because you took down some music, creating a dangerous situation for staff and patrons. This is why we need to keep them all up. You can take this any way that you want but i hope you learn before it is to late. I hope that you will put this in the peaper thank you. Allowing people to choose for themselves prevents these kinds of conflicts and maintains a peaceful and functional community space for all.  Sinserily Your, @PERSON1.
841	3818	2	3	I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves. I stand firmly with this because it is a personal choice to read material that is found offensive. I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropriate materials because they are simply not interested in them, just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid's book. Basically there is a natural maturity barrier that separates what each age level is interested in reading. There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing. People who would get offended, mainly children, are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence. And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you personally think is offensive. If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well. A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button. Also at a library there are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out material deemed too mature. Some people might enjoy material that others find offensive. If material is removed a lot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted. There would be a lot of complaints, and problems. And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited. The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have. Many people will be satisfied, and most people will be happy with this approach to access and choice.
842	3819	2	3	The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that people wish that their kids or even their own self did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if you were to take away every book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of the tone the author uses or if they do not like what the characters call each other. People all have their own mind set to a way that they want to live or how they want their kids to live. Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there are books on the shelves about kids drinking and then having bad effects on their life because they did drink, then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling because they are afraid of what would happen, and then in the long run telling after they get pregnant or injured from it, can be powerful. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to; it might help them feel some relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it; in the long run if they did take it off someone could get hurt or not know what to do and it could be all that one person's fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone? Authors like Judy Blume are good examples, as her books show how something that you might think is good turns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe. I have a friend that has parents that do not like the music on her ipod, so she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made copies of the songs that they did not like. She drives so the music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that people do not like, either due to their religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get their songs from there. There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artists now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use their brains. No one can stop them, not even the people that publish the songs and put them on the radio. In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid might grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid their age getting kidnapped they might understand more clearly on the whys in life. So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for their little girl or their teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the shelf. Keep playing the same music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on their own rather than you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over again. So keep the books on the shelves, let the radio play, and just be safe in doing it.
843	3820	2	3	Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no. Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segregated by race; the segregation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segregation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probably how some people feel when they get offended by the media, and such widespread offense can create real conflict. Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong, allowing them to learn from the content. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong by comparing different ideas? In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended and the severity of the offense. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no, a balanced approach based on the scale of the offense.
844	3821	2	3	Everybody is entitled to making their own decision. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that decision for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others; that's just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others who may want to read it. If there are some books that are offensive to a certain type of ethnicity or religion, etc., then just ignore it and go on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for all we know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs it for their work. Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very important for the future. The Catcher in the Rye is a good example; in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, but that book is now being used in our classroom and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like The Catcher in the Rye that are being taken out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers and readers. Katherine Paterson has the perspective of many authors; taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books left at all. For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book banned from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving for their own child. If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it; that is a parent's right. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted to only the most inoffensive works. The library is a place of discovery, not a place of restriction, and it should remain open to all ideas.
845	3822	2	3	Libraries are often known for protecting our children and keeping an educational atmosphere; however, you would be surprised the content our children might find in such a seemingly friendly place. With a simple library card, children could check out a boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn. But nobody can be looking over their child's shoulders all the time. The answer to this problem is strict censorship of available materials. Books are big, powerful, and contain a vast amount of information. Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children read books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library whether or not a book can be checked out. Most of the time, only adults can understand what the characters in a book are going through, grasping the complex themes and contexts. This might be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life, which children lack. Another common belief is that separating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem. The fact is, even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home that was brought from the library. The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries in the first place and censoring the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands. Libraries are great for research or school projects, but books and magazines that are inappropriate should never end up in the place built for an educational experience for your kids. Censorship has to be enforced to help keep and maintain our libraries' educational atmosphere and to keep our children safe from offensive material that they are not yet equipped to process.
846	3823	2	3	I don't think that certain materials should be removed if they're found offensive to people. If someone reads something and it offends them, they can go do something else, like choose a different book or engage in another activity entirely. I'm not the type of person to get offended too easily, so I don't know how well my opinion fits. Everyone gets offended over something, so I can see why people find some things offensive. But in all honesty, if someone read something and thought that it was offensive, they have the option to either say why they thought it was offensive, or they could just ignore it and move on with their day. In libraries, I think that if the librarian finds a story offensive, it should be okay for them to take it off the shelves; they work there after all and have a role in managing the collection. If it were me though, I'd just let it go, and if someone asks me to remove it, I might do it depending on the specific circumstances. A lot of people now-a-days, seem to take offense over everything. But a material should not be removed from a library shelf, unless the librarian, or the manager, find it offensive, then I can understand their decision from a professional standpoint.
847	3824	2	3	Censorship on Libraries. Do you ever walk into a library, walk up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and pick up a book that looks promising, and worth reading? Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this unfathomably great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the style that this book is written? Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do. But, if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any books to read at all. Books based on race, religion and even personal appearance can be a nuisance, because it segregates people and creates divisions. When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards? The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about a different faith? If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You might be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book. This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years without a clear resolution. Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf. This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention? You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about religion. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of people in this way. People are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person, unique and individual. What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and their size? Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words. Different genres of characteristics include; being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are criticized and teased relentlessly because they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased; it can be hurtful and damaging. Books based on faith, religion and even personal appearance can be a nuisance, because it segregates people. I have written you this letter to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the ideas they sometimes present, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books left at all. So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves. We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke. Where would the world be today, if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics? Do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be and how far we have come.
848	3825	2	3	It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them directly and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works might be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowledge they wish to acquire without restriction. These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor, created with great effort. What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compromising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression and right to choose. The capabilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display its functions are limited in their opportunities. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our literature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash, extinguished too soon. Just out of a few broken heartstrings? Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, misunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding and empathy? I think not; the cost is far too great. In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together if we unite. So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression for the sake of future generations.
849	3826	2	3	Knowledge Censorship. Would you ever remove something that be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither would I, and I dont believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controling how people think, known as communism, which is against our principles. Also anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything would be offensive, and removed. Then libraries would cease to exist as we know them. What about in the court room? If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials would leave people in a bored mindless state of mind, devoid of critical thought. Do you want the government controling what you think? I didn't think so. In the past, modern day Germany, Hitler did just that. He decided exactaly what went in and out of peoples minds. He did this by desiding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like things you can get at the library, right? We can't have the government controling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government run. If we let them deside what we read and listen to, thats the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom; it is a slippery slope. Lets say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation. Then, at the same time, an African American women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the mans book banned, and the man wants the womans book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy, because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it to much. Plus if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offencive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. Noone is left happy or enlightened. If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendent gets to say their piece to makes it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? Your going to go to jail, most likly an innocent person, and your marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentinced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial' or proper consideration. So, if you want to have an un-American, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because noone, except the writer knows exactally what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. Thats what the freedom we have is, you have a right to read, watch, and listen to whatever you want, and nobody can stop you. Do you want that to change? I know your awnser; it's a resounding no.
850	3827	2	3	A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. Censorship isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people, but it must be applied carefully. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the area in the library that contains the offensive materials; it is a matter of personal choice. In my own personal opinion, censorship doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent it or read it, to ensure maturity. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials without some oversight. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them, as per the library's policy. Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials on the shelves. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them if they don't wish to. Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them, perhaps online. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do it, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see regardless of barriers. If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents; the responsibility lies with the parent. If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business from patrons who seek them. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials for the community. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library, monitoring their choices. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules and guidelines for their access.
851	3828	2	3	To begin with, a woman might read a book about wives and find it offensive. But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it. Should it be taken off the shelf? No, why should it? Different people have different perspectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way about any given piece of media. The same thing goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it, but it was their choice to pick it up and look through it. No one held a gun to their head and said 'read the book' or 'look at the magazine.' Why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and others who might not. You can't just think about that one person; you have to consider everybody else. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen more wisely the first time and/or never should have chosen what they did. It is their own fault and their own responsibility. For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off the shelf; if its offensive, just don't read the book and etc. Another person might read it and like it immensely. Some people who find things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way or from a single viewpoint. Keep the book etc., on the shelf because if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive to someone. Then what will we be able to read or listen to? We would be left with nothing.
852	3829	2	3	There is much censorship that occurs in the world today. Music on the radio, television shows, or the internet is all censored to some degree. In today's society the library is a forgotten wonder to most, making it a secluded world of its own. The library is a place were one's mind can explore and discover as much as it wants without immediate judgment. The library should not be a place of restricted discovery, like on the television or the internet; censorship in libraries should be non-existant. People learn from all kinds of books; books with happy endings, and sad endings, and gruesome endings, are all able to provide valuable lessons for the attentive reader. Many say that history repeats itself. Therefore history is taught in schools so that the bad events that occurred in history can be recognized and prevented. This is the same for the books that are on library shelves. When reading a book, the reader is able to experience the lives of the characters as if they are living alongside them. Through the experiences of the characters, the reader gets to observe all the things done wrong and right by that character without actually living through the experience themselves. By the end of the book the reader will have new views on life, and will try to not make the same mistakes as the characters in the book. A major fear among parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that might be described in books. To be blatantly honest, there is foul language and inappropriate doings in this world. It is much better to have it discovered gradually through reading and maybe a couple of life experiences, than to have it all thrown in one's face at one moment. The censoring that occurs on the radio and television is fine for those mediums, but when someone wants to improve themselves by reading, they should be able to read whatever they feel is necessary for their growth. A library is a place of wondrous learning, but if there is censorship, it restricts one's learning and exploration. Through reading one is able to experience life without the consequences of experiencing life directly. All books are able to be learned from, and they should all have the opportunity to be learned from by those who seek them.
853	3830	2	3	Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experience and to read or listen to what we want; who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to? As an avid reader of all kinds of literature I can't stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and alternative ways of life. The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, and as individuals we should be able to read what we want, whether it is offensive to some or not. If you want to put certain restrictions on a book such as an age limit I can understand that, but to completely take them off the shelves means we are losing our greatest right as a free citizen. To read and watch or listen to other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our own back yard. Regarding music and television I understand some censorship; I don't want my little brother or any younger youth hearing certain explicit language or seeing anything obscene, but these days it's getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to, seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media. Many kids today have access to the internet which can be both good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to put certain blocks on their computer. Kids these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the internet and television, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible whether it be fiction, classics such as 'The Catcher in the Rye', or educational literature. So are our reading choices becoming scarce? Yes I believe so, and it all has to do with censorship. We can't read some of the classics because they're deemed 'racist' or are 'pornographic', but you have to understand for the time they were written they weren't considered so. So let everyone read what they want when they want without unnecessary restrictions.
854	3831	2	3	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' No, I do not believe that just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does. Everyone has a different opinion; we're all different and unique in our tastes. We need a variety of all books, music, movies, magazines, etc. to choose from. Censorship is understandable, in some ways and in certain contexts, but it should not dictate public availability. Without a variety for all, it would leave everyone with less choice and a narrower worldview. Your opinions, your decisions, and your outlook on life are one of a kind. How are you to tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book? Exactly, that doesn't make sense, right? If individuals didn't have options and choices there would be no real entertainment or intellectual growth. In my opinion; if someone has such a problem with a certain topic, subject, etc. then they should simply leave it alone and not engage with it. It's a big world with more than just you with your singular opinion. Be open minded and consider others! Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this very prompt. It just goes to show no one's opinion is entirely right or wrong; it is simply their perspective. Individuals should all have their own individuality and the freedom to express it. Without variety and choice, how is that even possible? From music, to books, to magazines, to movies, disagreements are one thing but in questions like this you have to learn to agree to disagree for the sake of collective freedom.
855	3832	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censorship in the library. This is a very tricky subject because it seems no one will ever be completely happy. All books, music, movies, magazines, etc. can be considered offensive to someone, somewhere. When it comes to books in the library we should have clearly defined sections. One for young adults, children, family, activity, romance, etc. If we have those then it would cut down on what books children can easily look at and help guide their choices. One time I went to the public library and I accidentally wandered into the adult books section. I knew that I was not supposed to go into that section, but if they had it marked more clearly that it was the Adult Books section then I might not have gone in there. Parents need to monitor what their kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into. If a child wanders into the romance section then they are going to see that kind of book; it is not the library's fault or even the fault of the writer. If the parent does not want to monitor what the child looks at directly, they could set clear boundaries. They could say 'Do not leave this section.' If my mom said that to me I would stay around the child books. The parents could monitor the child to solve the problem of accidental exposure. Libraries need to decide what kind of books they are going to have in the library based on community needs, not individual complaints. If the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child can not look at that book there. If your public library does keep those books in the open the parents could always go to a town hall meeting and tell the mayor, librarian, or other townspeople about their concerns. If you tell people the library has that kind of books then others will perhaps stand up against the books or for them, starting a dialogue. If you do not like what the library has on the shelves, you can suggest sections for the books, keep watch of what your kids look at, or tell someone that can do something about the problem. What are you going to do to improve your public library? How are you going to make your kids not go and look at the books you don't want them to see without removing access for everyone else?
856	3833	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be mandated. Censorship should not block the 'allegory' in some books that the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader. Censorship would lead to complete government control just like in the book '1984'. You could not see the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art. The word definition of allegory is a story within a story. It is where the author is trying to show a deeper meaning to the reader. For example, like in the book 'Lord of the Flies' is an allegory. It shows many stories tying in with each other. When the character Simon dies on the side of the cliff by the sea when the boys launch the huge rock over board. That shows the fall of man. In the Bible where Adam eats the apple from the tree and that is why we sin. You just cannot censor such a great book. Very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other. Everyone needs to look at both sides of the story. People need to know the true meaning of what is being said. Art should not be censored at all. Art is what makes people creative. The way artists make things abstract could kindle some controversy. Also they make things that we use today that we just don't think about, that are utilitarian. Who would give you the right to censor their master pieces. For example, the painter Pablo Picasso had a dark period in his work and painted demons in his paintings and people might think that is way too graphic. People need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time. Censorship is complete government control. This would lead to a society like in the book called '1984' by George Orwell. In his book he shows complete government control. We as the people of our government would be classified as the 'proles'. The proles made the majority of the people and were not very smart people. Also they could not think for themselves because the government censored everything you could think of. The government did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the ruling party. They knew that the proles could over throw them, but they were on top of their game and censored everything. This is what would happen if we censored everything. We all would have no personality at all. No one could express love the way we do now. Censorship in libraries would not be the best thing anyone should do. No one would know what an author would be leading to, not a single artist could display their art. Also censorship would lead to complete government control. This could not work in our society today. So censorship is not the best idea anyone could think of.
857	3834	2	3	Bad language and explicit content should be kept away from children, and yes, I do think they should be removed if they are bad. If you wouldn't say it to your parents face when you're at a younger age then you don't need to be listening to it or reading it. I would not want my younger kids reading or watching anything that they know they couldn't say to my face. There are so many things that little kids can see. Like at any grocery store or any where there are magazines with ladies in their bra and underwear and its the same thing with the guys. I don't think its right they should they them put up where it isn't so easy for the little ones to see. Those kind of things are just going to get kids asking questions that make the parents have to lie. Then there's kids watching tv and they have the stupid cartoons where the kids are on there cursing and talking about sex then your kid goes to that channel when your not around hear all these stupid stuff. Then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it. When you can just take channels like that off your tv and make everything easier. I think the worst is listening to people sing about killing people and raping kids and all this and that. I would never let my kids listen to music like that I don't care how old they are. I also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up are from the music they want to listen to its horrible. I would do anything to make it where kids couldn't listen to that stuff until their parents didn't care. I know my parents didn't like me listening to it when I was young and I see why now that I'm older and know what all of it means so I'm never going to let my kids listen to it when they are at a young age. In all that I hope that I made a good point and hope you feel the same way. Why let our kids listen to the stuff that hurts them and us in the long run it just not worth the trouble letting them do what they want.
858	3835	2	3	I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to. Anything publically exposed is going to be seen anyhow. I think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something too mature or inappropriate for themself. If it is a child I think the parent shall be in charge of that decision not the librarian. Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. People read all kinds of material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. Everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair. If it is public that mean it should be released under certain circumstances or age, and maturity. Regardless of in a book or magazine everything that you don't want people to see will always show up somewhere else, such as the tv or the internet. The public library is were people go to get books to learn more about something so if you take that book off the shelf someone might miss out on an education about something. I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about somethings that are out there. If its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it. If its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent. Anything publically exposed in a book, magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want rather elders' agree to it or not. Nudity, profanity, violence, and provocative material are in everything now days even cartoons so there is no way of keeping it from children or people its apart of everyday living.
859	3836	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' While many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style. Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library. 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', 'Harry Potter', and 'Catcher in the Rye' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive. These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader. While one reader may love the story and wear out the pages, another may get halfway through and never finish it. However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct. 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain is a classic example of a censored book. Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some. However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong. Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it. None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response. Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'? Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way. They are a tool of knowledge. Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge. Every story has a unique style, which may appeal to some and not to others. Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written. 'Harry Potter' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story. How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the 'Harry Potter' books? They often state that it is their favorite book of all time. If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it. Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions. How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp? If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons.
860	3837	2	3	I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons may not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read. I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge. All offensive items a library may have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the shielding nature of others.
861	3838	2	3	All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf. Well at least I know I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'. I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the shelves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and explicit sex. A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called, '@CAPS1'. I thought it was a good book but it was also very explosive and inappropriate. The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in an abusive relationship, intense peer pressure, and a dangerous addiction to sex and drugs. This book was exposing and very detailed in its descriptions, in which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book. I feel sex and violence shouldn't be so graphically displayed in books or any other type of media for young audiences. In conclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the shelves of the library unless they are issued to someone eighteen or older to protect younger readers.
862	3839	2	3	I am writing to the newspaper, about removing certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more. I don't think this should be allowed because I don't think it would be fair to others who may want to access them. I'm going to give you three reasons why you shouldn't let people just remove stuff like that off of shelves. @CAPS1 first reason is that, what if you had a child and wanted he or she to see the same movie or book you did when you were little? But they took it off the shelves. That would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they can't. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 second reason is, what if you and a wife or husband had a favorite song, but they took it off the shelves? That would be devastating, it would just break your heart. Well I know it would me if it was our wedding song, a piece of our personal history. The last reason and @CAPS1 favorite reason is, you just have your own opinion. Everyone has their own opinion, if you don't want to see them or look at them just don't do it. It's as easy as that, just try to ignore it. It's really not your problem to worry about what others choose to enjoy. Those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 if we let this happen everyone will take advantage of it until the shelves are bare. That is why I am @CAPS2 no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves.
863	3840	2	3	Should we censor books in libraries? Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 provides a very valid point. If we start taking off books that we find offensive, there will be none left for anyone to read. Books are meant to provide information and insight into someone's life and experiences. If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter, which is a form of intellectual suppression. The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity. Books provide insight into the author's life and the world they lived in. Also the things that are happening in history affect the author's tone or style, like @ORGANIZATION1. During his lifetime, @CAPS2 was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to appease the @LOCATION1. It also helped appeasing the @LOCATION1 since he was sponsoring @ORGANIZATION1's plays. Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be @CAPS3. He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly saw oppressive things like serfs. When he wrote his tales, he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side. @CAPS3 was not afraid to displease the @LOCATION1 in his social commentary. If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson wisely observed. Where one might find valuable information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa. Every book would have someone say it was offensive for one reason or another. It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it; it does not matter. Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are considered offensive. However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books. It builds the tone and mood of the story or character, creating a certain image and teaching us not to emulate what these people are doing. The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life. These stories teach us life lessons about consequences. Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like it, that does not mean someone else does not. It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it. I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me. It revolves around us as a whole, and if someone starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same? It would not be fair to impose one person's views on everyone. Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity and hard work. It also might make them think that their own ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them in the future. I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone, but I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of restrictive society. Books are important to have. They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience. It is important to be aware of what is going on around you in the world. I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occurring in society because my parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society. Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like, both the good and the bad. So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up and understanding the world. I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after. Unfortunately most do not, but there are some that have a happy life. That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad. So @PERSON2 was wise in her observation about the dangers of censorship. Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this process has started and where would it end?
864	3841	2	3	Books, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves of libraries. For many years people have come to the library for them, seeking knowledge and entertainment. Some materials @MONTH1 be vulgar as well as they @MONTH1 be offensive to some, but there should be an age check out law instead of outright removal, as well as being within consideration for this century's ways and societal norms. There are many people who thrive off of the horrible things people put out into the world; they love the pain of others as a form of dark entertainment. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves completely, there should be an age limit to what certain age groups should read and access. Yes there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that responsibility lies with the parents to monitor and guide them. If there was an age limit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem of inappropriate exposure. As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book, giving them control. If we had all of this in place then there would not be any more problems with censorship; it would be a nice controlled library environment that respects both access and responsibility. So in conclusion this is the way to go for a balanced approach. This is the future of tomorrow's libraries.
865	3842	2	3	Let's think about it: in today's known world the children and teens have access to pretty much everything through the internet and media. If you ask a teenager this same question, should this stuff be taken off the shelves, they might say no because they want the freedom to choose. If you ask an adult however they are most likely going to say yes, wanting to protect the youth. The music that surrounds young adults and children isn't the best in terms of content. Go ahead and listen to the lyrics; you will be amazed at what they hear. If they have access to it in libraries then they are going to take it and borrow it, so the content matters. I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off if they are inappropriate. Now that's just my opinion. Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff, which sets an example. I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this distracting and sometimes harmful media. @CAPS1 you think about it, they have so many rights and access that they shouldn't have at a young age. If there is anything offensive then it should be taken off the shelves to create a better environment. They should be replaced with educational things that promote learning. Let's go back to where it all began back @CAPS1 when everything started to come out into the open. Did you have most of this stuff growing up? You probably didn't have such easy access. But now you can find anything almost anywhere, which is kind of sad if you ask me, as it exposes children too early. Magazines however are starting to become more like movies and music in their content, mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show openly. If you look at athletes, it doesn't matter who it is, they get in trouble for things they shouldn't have said or done. @CAPS1 they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff, acting as role models. That right there will help out education and what not, guiding the youth. You can become a more responsible adult by showing them what's right and what's wrong, starting with what they listen to or what they watch on screen. I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway; that's because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't set those boundaries @CAPS1 when I was little. If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want, the odds are they might not do good in school because of the influences. One way you can help out is by hanging out with the child or children, even teens, even though they don't want you to sometimes. Talk to them, make conversations, teach them right from wrong; @CAPS1 if you teach a child right from wrong, the outlook on school and their future will be better and more positive.
866	3843	2	3	When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' But how would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would probably be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library. However, a little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adult section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it meant but they would have that image in there head for a very long time. Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns, which is also unsettling.  Its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender that is too mature for them. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable with its content. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even alcohol, which is not what they expected.  The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine, which is aimed at teenagers. The car magazines often feature girls modeling in front of the cars to make them look better or irresistible. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding. You could have just wanted to look at it because of the babies, but you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding in a public context.  The library is a very resourceful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think the music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies and books; they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in, so you are prepared.  I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them, ensuring a more comfortable environment for all patrons.
867	3844	2	3	Libraries are stocked filled with all kinds of reading materials, such as books, magazines, and catalogs, but are all of these appropriate for the crowd that dwindle around a library? My answer is no, but should they be taken away from the libraries, no. Although many kids go through libraries, so do many adults trying to find good pieces of literature, which is why they should keep these books available to most, just with some thoughtful organization.  When I was in the seventh grade I recall reading a book, by the title of a popular author, about a child who had gotten sexually abused, and I wish I had never picked up that book. Although it made me very frightened, it taught me a very good lesson about the dangers in the world. I learned at a young age to never associate with strangers, and if it wasn't for this novel it could have been very different for me. Therefore I believe it is good to get children at a young age small dosages of the real life, not every thing in the world is sugar coated like some people would argue, and books can provide that perspective safely.  From classic novels to the bible, there is a vast variety of literature available. This variety provides stories for many different audiences and tastes. The libraries try to do their best by categorizing these books so that smaller children do not get their hands on the wrong books, using systems like separate shelves or sections. Instead of taking the books totally out of the repertoire, another suggestion that could be made is to have a system like they do for mature rated video games and only allow people over the age of seventeen to check certain books out. This would make it near impossible for children to get their hands on the wrong books without proper authorization.  Lastly, a suggestion that could be made is to label inappropriate books such as adult content and movies clearly. This could make a small difference and make children think twice before opening up a book labelled for mature audiences only, similar to warnings on other media. This provides stories for all, and protects small children from magazines such as those with explicit covers, ensuring a better experience for everyone.  Like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I perceive what she is trying to say is similar to what I am advocating. She wants all the books to be provided and kids just to be shyed away from these, and hope that children can make the right decision when choosing a piece of literature from a library, which is a balanced approach to access and protection.
868	3845	2	3	I think that if it is a problem for others and not all, why can't we just separate the things in sections? That way there would be no problems for those who are uncomfortable, while still allowing access for those who seek such materials. It is a simple and effective solution that respects everyone's preferences.  I mean, why change something entirely if only a few people don't like something? That's only going to lead to a big conflict and dissatisfaction among various groups. Think about if we were to try and give everyone what they want, how would that work out? Not good at all, as it would be impossible to please every single person. So you should just limit things down and put them in sections based on their content and intended audience, creating a more organized and harmonious environment for all library users. This approach maintains access while minimizing unintended exposure.
869	3846	2	3	Censorship is a very sensitive topic. There are so many things people dislike, so they censor information, hiding the ideas from the people who don't know about them. I personally detest censorship. I would rather the world be an educated place with minor dangers, then a place where everything is kept secret and safe, as ignorance can be a greater risk in the long run.  You must be thinking, 'There are some things we have to censor, they can harm our children's minds.' But in truth, your children will find out about these topics in the real world eventually anyway, through friends or media. In reality, drugs, alcohol, sex, rape, violence, and all the other things you censor are common things that your kids will hear about. Most children first hear about them in school, normally elementary, and if not they will definitely find out in junior high. If they will eventually find out anyway, wouldn't it be better to let them find out the easy way, through controlled and educational materials?  Now you must be thinking, 'But if they find out too young, it could traumatize them.' That is a risk, but most teenagers are more traumatized anyway when exposed to difficult topics without any prior knowledge or context. If they already know what their dealing with they would know how to react, but if they have no knowledge of whats going on they could make a major mistake without even realizing the consequences. Once again, wouldn't it be better they find out from you or a book, then find out the hard way through personal experience or scare tactics?  Now, you might be thinking, 'Our children must be protected, this knowledge could just put them in more danger.' It might put them in more danger, that's always a possibility in any learning situation. The world is full of possibilities though, anything could happen at any time. This knowledge that you always hide from them might be what they need to know later on, and won't know when they need it most. What would they do if they see their friends start doing drugs, and since they have never heard of drugs, they don't know it's a bad thing to do? Or if they see older kids drinking, and are offered a drink, but don't know they shouldn't take it? Or if they wind up kissing someone they like, and it goes too far, but they don't know what their doing because they were never taught?  Anything could happen, and your children need to be prepared for the realities of life. If they don't know of these things, they can't tell if what their doing is good or bad, and they might wind up getting in trouble or hurt unnecessarily. Tell them, or let them read the books you always censor at the libraries so that they know and can make informed decisions. Life is full of risks, so let them know, that way when the time comes their ready to handle situations with wisdom and understanding.
870	3847	2	3	As I walked through a local bookstore as a young girl I saw a popular magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it. I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read because of its mature content. I found my self embarrassed and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored or placed in an adult section. I think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing for protecting young minds. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents jobs to teach at the appropriate time. A ten year old girl should not be able to see an inappropriate movie, magazine or book when ever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves in a careful manner. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be, allowing for natural development.  Censoring the books helps by keeping small children 'sheltered' in a positive way; they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up themselves without the pressure of adult concepts. The movies that are made often give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is, creating unrealistic expectations.  You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up too quickly. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too, which is harmful. Children see this and think that if their favorite star acts like that so should I, leading to early maturation. The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run by promoting these ideals. They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini on the cover. Sports magazines often prides itself on that image. Maxim has the swimsuit issue with a bunch of models laying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that its normal and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like, which is damaging. They get the men's magazines and drool over how the center fold looks. Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way to be accepted. It makes them think if you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too, which is a shallow goal.  Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, and things to try in bed that a child could just walk and see easily. Many of these books have images of how do this and that that are explicit. That it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable if stumbled upon. When you go to a bookstore or any book store they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books. Many young people might think love, oh I bet that's romantic or a storybook tale. They see the cover that intrigues them, with a pretty girl on it. Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents by preventing accidental exposure. The kids can just grow up the way that they should, without being rushed.  Now movies give a very large false pretence on what sexual intercourse really is about. They see the people do all these things and they think that its normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex. When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe both emotionally and physically. This isn't just fun and games as portrayed. In our society today many young women get raped and assaulted. Does it show that on the movie no it doesn't, many young women as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to be raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made which often ignores these realities. Pornography is false, women don't just look at each other and get turned on without context. Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is from a responsible source.  Censoring is something that I strongly believe in for the protection of children. To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate for our age. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait until their children are mature enough. By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids in their own time, and the kids get the time to grow up without being burdened by adult concerns too early.
871	3848	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote, ''If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'' This quote speaks to the core of freedom of speech, which is about believing in your own decisions and the choices you have made. If I were to reflect my views on censorship in libraries, I believe we all would have that same opportunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included. There could be inappropriate books in the library that we absolutely would not want our younger group of siblings reading. The best thing is to ask ourselves a fundamental question: Should we have the right to take our kids' freedom and right to read, listen to, and access updated media and publications from them when we had it? Should we put a censorship on the libraries really? I feel that censoring a library would not be necessary, considering a library is a manual guide of history. Our libraries are organized from A to Z in authors' names, separated into non-fiction and fiction, with CDs in one section, movies in another, magazines elsewhere, and adult books separated from children's books in different sections. Libraries all across the world have had a kid that might have chosen a book that was not appropriate for them to read, but what kid hasn't. What would a book hurt them if there is plenty of bad influences, peer pressure, violence, and sexually explicit publicity everywhere and prominently in the media. It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books. I feel no, we should not take our learning from our babies. Growing up as a kid I loved being able to go to the library; it helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling, and I learned plenty of new words. The books I read growing up weren't perfectly suitable for my age, but I could relate to a lot of books I chose as a kid, so no, I feel we should not censor libraries. We need them to be a fun place for our children and us to go to for learning, fun, comfort, and etcetera. We can't take that from our generation; it just would not be right to deprive them of such a valuable resource.
872	3849	2	3	Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed, as they can cause distress and conflict. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too, creating a shared sense of discomfort. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, we will reduce problems before they even happen, preventing potential upset. Now, more than ever, you will find offensive things in libraries because societal sensitivities have shifted. More people get offended by lesser things now, which increases the likelihood of conflict. One reason to have censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derogatory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that kind of material. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community, which is a dangerous lesson. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more than likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others as a direct result. If the government provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our government doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name and erodes public trust. If we look to our government for support and answers, we expect them to uphold community standards. How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country, leading to a loss of confidence. Which would cause many more problems then needed, creating unnecessary social friction. It would be an easier thing just to censor our libraries and avoid these issues altogether. If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value and educational merit. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something useful. Rather than lead them into making bad decisions, these materials would guide them toward positive growth. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it; not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried, so the library does not need to stock everything. If a library does have offensive things, I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for without compromising the library's environment. When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex positions.' I highly disagree with such content and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will it calm down some of the problems that are re-occurring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely and create a safer, more constructive space for everyone.
873	3850	2	3	There is a lot of different things that can be offensive to all sorts of people, making it a complex issue to manage. So if we started taking things off TV or out of books and magazines, we would be always taking stuff out, which is an impractical and endless task. If something is too graphic for kids, the simple solution is to put it in the adults-only area; this is a matter of organization, not removal. Would censorship be the answer to take out stuff? No, it is not the right approach. We need to be more aware of where our children are and what they are accessing, and there would be less problem as a result of this vigilance. If we made changes to the age limits on movies, we might be even better off, creating clearer guidelines. If parents were to watch the movie first or alongside their children, then the parent would be able to tell them what is okay and what is not, providing essential guidance. We need to put more true history stuff in them and make them where you want to watch them; we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know about the world. The music should be censored somewhat, like with rap music, which often contains explicit content. There is a lot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kids don't hear it and are not exposed to inappropriate language or themes. There might even be a better way to control this stuff so little kids can't get a hold of it, perhaps through better labeling or restricted access sections. We can have teachers help tell the kids and let them know that it is not right for them to watch that, reinforcing the message at school. We also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on TV, as their content is not always suitable. There are some that need to be cleaned up to be more appropriate for young audiences. There are also a lot of different opinions in what people want, which makes a single standard difficult. Then there are some that don't care about it too, adding to the complexity. Maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it in a way that satisfies the majority while protecting children.
874	3851	2	3	A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf, but this is a shortsighted view. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library, as each has potential value. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things, providing unique insights and knowledge. Magazines may not be any help towards a lot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you and offer current information. Music is not just something you listen to, but it's something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book, enhancing the overall experience. Movies can have a certain impact on someone; a lot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but they could have some encouragement, or they can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying, revealing deeper truths about human nature. No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there just for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know, expanding their understanding. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a person's life in profound ways. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of schools, or even the public libraries, to increase access. The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they may understand life and its complexities. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading, missing the deeper meaning. It's really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, that's why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelf to encourage deeper engagement. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life and the importance of preserving access to all ideas. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world and the diverse perspectives they offer.
875	3852	2	3	A library is a public place for all ages, designed to serve a diverse community. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons, catering to various interests and needs. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it, making it inviting. For adults they have coffee tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books, ensuring comfort for everyone. Never should a library have to disclose certain materials because of the ages that come in and out; access should be based on trust and personal responsibility. Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive; it would only limit access for others. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, and they should also be monitored by a parent or guardian while in the library to ensure they find age-appropriate materials. Most kids wouldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it anyway, as their interests naturally guide them. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are bookstores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't be thrown out of a library, which aims to be inclusive. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries, regarding access to information. The world is full of offensive things period, and sheltering children in one place is ineffective. Now while a child is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library, so removal there would not stop exposure. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything; it would only create a false sense of security. I think that if the parents teach their children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines, as guidance is key. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain extent in my selection of books, valuing diversity. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in there but at the same time I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing, which was my own responsibility. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remove certain books just because children are in the library; instead, we should focus on education and supervision.
876	3853	2	3	Censorship was the last time someone told you what you could, and couldn't do? Especially if it was something you didn't want to do. How'd that make you feel? You probably didn't want to do it did you. Censorship is somewhat the same way. The other day, my friends and I wanted to go see a new movie that just came out. We weren't allowed to see it though. You know why? Due to censorship, we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie. So, now the only way we'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us. Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends? Doesn't go so well does it. Censorship violates freedom of being different. You can't listen to music, watch movies, or even read certain books, unless you're of a certain age. That's not fair. Censorship is like a modern day dictator. Tells you what you can and can't do, how you can dress, and what to say. Everybody would be the same then. How did that dictator do with his idea, he failed miserably. How do you think the historical victims felt, they were punished for believing, or doing something different. They weren't hurting anybody, they just wanted to live their lives a different way. That's what censorship is doing, classifying people into certain groups, telling them what they can and can't see, do, or listen to. That's what makes the world different, people that are different. Don't make everyone be the same.
877	3854	2	3	Everyone has different views on works of literature, whether it be books, magazines, movies, or music. If libraries were to remove this stuff from the shelves then they would be losing business, they would be losing children, and they would be taking away the reason for it being on the shelves. These libraries would be losing business from the people who maybe like the kind of stuff that they might not. The people running the business might decide to take out older pieces of work that could offend younger people in this generation. The stuff wrote, sang, or played in these things might harm these people but that is not what it is in there for. The things that harm people are in there to show people in the younger generations how life was lived in the older days, as in the times of slavery. This would play a role on children that use this library also. If this literature was taken out, children might think that things have always been the way they are as they see it. If these children grew up and were to see a book, hear a song, or watch a movie about how things were in the olden days, and how much it has changed, then they might never believe it because they were not taught as children. As they are older, they might still never have the interest to learn about these types of things because they never knew about them growing up. These things are written to teach people and children about how things used to be, they are not used to harm people. When people take these things as harmful, they are not getting the true meaning that the author had in mind when they wrote them. Libraries should keep these pieces of literature on their shelves, only to teach young people of what the world has came from and how their older relatives lived, and what they came from.
878	3855	2	3	I feel that there should be censorship in libraries. Children shouldn't be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to. This could save people from getting in trouble and reading the wrong stuff. There should be censorship in libraries. I feel that it should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy. One other reason that I feel that it should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wrong way. When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldn't be reading or watching, you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it might be. That's why if we had censorship, they wouldn't have a chance to do so. Another reason I say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something then you should not have it in the library. As you can see, these are the reasons that I feel we should have censorship in libraries. With censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same. They already have book stores and online sites, where you can buy books and movies, and they have no censorship you just have to be a certain age and have a credit card. That way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card. So with that being said, I feel there should be censorship in libraries.
879	3856	2	3	The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it. Sometimes there might be inappropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesn't apply to you it might to someone else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you don't think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it. Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how they're bad for you and that you shouldn't do them. I know I like reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I don't want to live like that. There are some things I don't think should be allowed like books, magazines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because their skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not their fault they're like that and its just inappropriate. Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we might complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inappropriate things at the library you don't like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go.
880	3857	2	3	I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images. But that brings up the question about racism almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them such as To Kill a Mockingbird that book uses the n-word to describe african americans, but when that book was published that was common talk now people look at you like you have just murdered their first born child if you were to use that word. For the most part though books are not all that offensive at least none of the books I read. I know that there are books and magazines such as playboy and maxim that are offensive to women and have probably cause a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that. I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids. I know that during the second world war over in germany many books were banned because they had something to do with catholicism or something that Hitler believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race. I know that for a short time a lot of what Mark Twain wrote was banned for using the n-word but people have to realize that when Mark Twain was alive that was everyday language. As for me being catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good catholic. I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list. I can see how some of those books could be banned. As for music I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place. I know that all of this rap genre is what my generation is into even though I dont see why kids like that kind of music. I also think that music produced by the arian brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because their music is overtly racist. I dont think that movies should be banned from the libraries because of violence or anything of that nature. I do think that the movie should be banned if it contains anything of the nature of pornography but they do not let those kinds of movie in the libraries anyway so they are a step ahead of me. I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said that if I have those rights then everyone else does to and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive then someone else will find something else offensive and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves. My view of what I think is offensive is very relaxed compared to other's I do not get offended at a lot of things.
881	3858	2	3	The @CAPS1 Materials     Have you ever came acroos a book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know. My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves. People should have ther own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read. My opinion is that materials that @MONTH1 be offensive to certain individuals should not be taking off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies,etc., where access can be managed appropriately.     I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, but it was just full of action/adventure.This was very unfair in my eyes, just because I was young I couldnt check out a certain movie. This was experience that I been through, which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offenseto someone should not be removed, but rather their placement should be considered.      Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things. No one is going to have the same interest all the time. So by takiny materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking somethimg they @MONTH1 be interested in. I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. Then again I think all materials are not the same they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from, fostering a more inclusive environment.     In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual, might just be very interesting to another person. This a saying I heard before from the ebony magazine ,'another person junk @MONTH1 be someone else treasure' which I believe is a good saying for this topic and perfectly captures the essence of personal preference.
882	3859	2	3	I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like and exercising their fundamental rights.
883	3860	2	3	Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not. Like a qoute i once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                         - Katherine Paterson, Author     If you ask me, I think there should be a certain autority to these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 people sign it then the book could be removed. All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in librarys, as they all can contain contentious material.      I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person dosen't like something then no body should have the right to have it. But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe its best that we dont. We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure there not getting into something there not supposed to be in. Same goes with books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles, which can present challenging interpretations.     Now dont get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and trys to check out an 'inapropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute here, That doesnt meen the child cant go into the library find a book and just read it there. Theres also the senario where, mind me it @MONTH1 not be your child but with todays crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it, completely bypassing any safeguards.     In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we dont think children should be reading. Still we should definately have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully its yours now too, as it aims to protect the community's values.
884	3861	2	3	Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has there own taste and should be free to explore it.     Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch. ect.. People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it. Libraries are great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen. And other people should not get offended by what other like, as it is a matter of personal choice.     Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fare to others who might like it and find value in it?     If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has there own taste. Don't be offended by what others like, as diversity of thought is what makes a library a valuable resource for the entire community.
885	3862	2	3	Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away by censoring certain materials.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature, which is a natural part of a diverse society.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area, as parental guidance is also a key factor.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area, providing a sensible compromise.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives and needed research.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom to learn and explore?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read, thus upholding the fundamental principle of intellectual freedom.
886	3863	2	3	I believe everyone has the right to voice their own opinion on life. If we censor one's books, music, or movies because they are deemed inappropriate, it would be like silencing an opinion that stands out among the others. If we silence the author and their story or song, how will we be able to view life through another person's perspective? In the United States we have the freedom of speech and press. These constitutional amendments make it so that others can voice an opinion without being immediately shot down. Although we have these amendments, there are still restrictions on what we are allowed to publish. Say we found a diary written by a troubled individual; are we allowed to view his deepest, darkest thoughts? Or are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes? His ideas are different, does that mean we shouldn't show them? No, we should show them, we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life and understanding the human condition. I believe that no matter whose ideas it is, if allowed by the author, they should be allowed to be read and comprehended in our own way. If one wishes to learn about how to murder in a public library, then I think they should be allowed to do so. The reason why is that the library is becoming somewhat obsolete, as the technology era is officially here. There is not a thing we can't find in a library that can't also be found online. Although the library is a government-run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials they want if the media is censored. It is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a library a child could find it. But like the internet, you can implement systems to block things from those kids. All voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biased, or just insane. These are ways to view the perspective or the reason behind hate and war. If we can learn from other mindsets through books, music, and movies, then I think we should be allowed to. Nothing should be blocked from the public. Everyone has the right to voice their own opinion through their own chosen way, and that is a fundamental principle of a free society.
887	3864	2	3	KEEP ALL BOOKS ON THE SHELF! I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library. If we did that then there wouldn't be any books left, as almost any book could be found offensive by someone. The only thing we should be moderately worried about is the rated R movies. Yeah, those can be taken out of the library if necessary, but even that is debatable. If one book is offensive to someone, then don't get it, but someone else might like that book and find value in it. For example, an older woman is looking through a magazine, and she sees a teenage woman taking drugs, or being half naked. Although she is offended, the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip and finds it relatable. We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre. There wouldn't be any diverse categories left in the library, defeating its purpose. A good idea is to separate the books, perhaps putting the ones that seem more offensive in the back. Keep the children's books away from the big mystery horror books to create a more comfortable environment. Another example is this: a student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavery, but there aren't any books on slavery because somebody thought the topic was offensive against African Americans. This would hinder education. I understand that there are reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of explicit sexual content. Children do not need to be around those kinds of books. Or some books being taken out because of religious beliefs, like one book being removed because it was about worshiping the devil, or something similar. The movie situation I understand more. I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing a movie that has a graphic sex scene, or drug content in it. You could take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf. Just because I want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf. Then the library's movie business would be over, limiting choice for everyone. To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't, as it is a public resource. Personally, I think that there should be a wide variety in the library. If not, everybody would get bored of the same books, reading them over and over. KEEP THE COLLECTION ON THE SHELF.
888	3865	2	3	Katherine Paterson, who is an author, once thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read, then it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others, offering a perspective I had not considered. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience why I disagree with Katherine Paterson. In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using the Dewey Decimal system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the Holy Bible. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a Bible in her life. After helping her find the Bible, she asked, 'Why is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of Jesus and why this was important to me and many others. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about, sparking a genuine curiosity. It is against the law in some states that a Bible be in school at all. This is because of others' beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the Bible on a shelf, that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunately, other people think this also, which can limit access to knowledge. One book can change a person's life; what if that book was not in the library to change another? We must protect the diversity of thought that libraries provide.
889	3866	2	3	I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material. Its a library, a place where people go to get information from a multitude of sources and viewpoints. If you don't want your kid, or kids, reading, watching, or listening to those kinds of material then you shouldn't have to let them read, listen to or watch any offensive material, until they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it. It is a parent's responsibility to guide their children, not the library's to restrict access. It is a library, and they are gonna have a wide variety of books, as they should. I don't think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or its too gory or has too many curse words for your kid. Not everyone gets offended by the same things, or the same material. If you do, then don't read that book or watch that movie, but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it. That is a matter of personal choice, not public policy. Libraries are made for the entire community and the people in it, not just one person. Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by, and they have that right. This is what I think on the censorship of books, movies, music, magazines, etc. Its a library, they are going to have a bunch of material, some of which may not be to your taste. If you find something offensive, be mature, put it back on the shelf and find something else to read, watch or listen to, allowing others the same freedom of choice.
890	3867	2	3	In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Many people can feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropriate for anyone to see or hear. Inappropriate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that might offend people. The lyrics in songs can be offensive. Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and other listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as depictions of sex, race, and graphic violence. I believe that, if a book, music, movie, or magazine upsets you then you should simply stay away from that section or just that material in particular. If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways, which is often curated for their age group; and if you're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you. I have been in a library a few times in my life, and when I search for what I'm looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me, focusing instead on my own goals. In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above. People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them, preserving access for all.
891	3868	2	3	Who is to say what is appropriate for whom? Who is to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view, like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing, and censorship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridiculous and disrespectful to authors. In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except that mother won't let me watch that. It just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you, as if they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. It causes children to go behind your back more, and when they're in trouble, they will act as if you're their last place where they can ask for help, when you should be their first resort. No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. It's altering an author's work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and someone didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal, not required. Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children, will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of telling them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language? Or make them feel like a bad person for doing something your grandparents did when they were young? I conclude that censorship is unjust, unfair, and is the real wrong, not the profanity or the violence that will one day be a part of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset that there's nothing wrong in this world or that everything is censored and controlled. I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nurture.
892	3869	2	3	I believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons. I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular. First, it could be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. First, it could be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. People come to libraries to look at what they're interested in to entertain themselves. There should be all types of literature in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike. Every time an item is removed off of a shelf, there will be an unsatisfied customer. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Libraries always have some type of organization. In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections. This solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them. If that doesn't help, librarians should post a sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. A customers' needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own. If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items, because they know what readers like, then no one else should involve themselves. If I owned a library, I would be upset if a customer demanded I remove a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business. In conclusion, I believe it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons. First, it could be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading. Second, there are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. I believe I expressed my opinion to the fullest. Although some people might disagree with the way I feel, I'm sticking with it. There definitely wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons.
893	3870	2	3	Newspaper company, I am writing to this company on why I think certain books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I am writing to tell you from my own experience and readings that will convince an argument. I am reflecting my view on censorship in libraries. I am writing so you can hear me out on what I have to say and persuade you in this essay. First, I think no book should be taken off any shelf of any library, whether it was to do with people's thoughts on religion, race or any other thing that has been offensive to anyone in the past. For example, gay and lesbian marriage and people's thoughts and opinions on this topic. I believe that no one should disrespect anyone's opinion on what they have to say. It depends on what kind of language you're using for this type of subject; if it has harsh words and it's supposed to be harmful, then yes it should be removed. Another thing is children taking books off shelves. Maybe you should escort your child in the child section and tell him or her what they should not do, like taking stuff down that they are not supposed to. What I'm saying is if the material is supposed to hurt others and is offensive, using negative words to harm others' feelings, it should be removed. My letter to you was to show you my opinion on what I think should be in a library or not. I have used some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what I think is right or wrong in this situation. I hope my topics and argument have convinced you on whether you should remove a book from a shelf.
894	3871	2	3	Are there universally evil books that no one should read? Are good and bad no longer matters of opinion for the readers themselves? The answer is no. Censorship is a terrible practice masquerading as a boon. The right to read certain books should not be left to a conservative few, because everyone has their own opinion about everything. There is always something we can potentially learn from books, and it's never right to take that away. Freedom of speech should certainly come into play here as well, allowing the authors' words to be heard without interference from those who would dictate what we read. There is a reason libraries have many sections. They have to cater to the individual tastes of the masses, without regard to what other people find offensive. If one was to go through the library and burn every book they did not like, there would be scarcely anything left. Send in another person with different tastes, and then you have a completely empty library. It is far better to leave all the books alone so that everyone can find something to enjoy reading. Basically, there are bound to be people who have similar opinions to the author of just about anything, so allow the authors to share those opinions. Then we have the knowledge portion of the issue. Offensive material to one person might be what another person wants or needs to read, whether for recreation or class. There is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing. Perhaps a restricted section would be in order if the problem would involve corruption of innocent minds, but a full censor would never be necessary. Finally, there is an amendment in the Constitution of the United States for preventing censorship. It is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech, whether it be books, movies, music, or magazines. And what is more restrictive to an author than to have their books banned? The greatest difference between our country and a totalitarian government is the simple freedom allowed in the library. If we start restricting that freedom, what are we then? In short, censorship is a harmful practice that should never be used. People all have their own opinions, all media can be learned from, and our freedom should not be restricted. The practice of censorship is what should truly be banned from the shelves.
895	3872	2	3	Dear Editor, The question is, is it safe to draw the line on what kids should or should not see as far as the world is concerned? What makes kids behave better, being sheltered from life or being life smart and knowing what is going on in this world? I think it's safe to say what we do or do not want our kids to do, say, etc. But in other terms, do we have full control of our kids twenty-four seven? I know that this might sound weird, but I strongly believe in the simple fact that kids are being over sheltered today! Our kids are growing up with new technology. It's the century for computers and laptops and gaming systems. Our kids don't know what it's like to go outside anymore. The world has so much to offer us, yet we turn it down because we see what all the new advances have to offer as well. I think it is very important to be books smart as well as street smart; if you spend all your time doing one thing at a time, you are gonna end up lacking on one thing. I believe grades will come. I think that our kids are over sheltered for the simple fact that when our kids see something that we don't want them to see, or they're not ready for, then they're not allowed to see it, but who's to say on the days you're not watching them that they're not going to go in the real world and just see exactly what you didn't want them to! This is why it's important for you to teach your child what is going on in the world and not leave them in the dark. Also, we are living in the new age of life, where computers and laptops are the number one thing in the world right now for people to be using throughout the day. It is hard for kids to understand the realness of life since everything is done over the internet now. It is a privilege to be so far advanced in the world, yet we still don't know what to do! As we get older, we are not gonna know nearly as much stuff as needs to be known and taught because as we get older, we're getting more logic and more information over the materials on the web. Kids will not know how to fix cars or know how to start up a lawn mower. I think that books should not be taken off the shelf because as the day goes by, kids' reality is getting taken away more and more! I think that it is a big deal what kids learn about everyday life because that is our future, and if they have no idea what is going on, it scares me because there are going to be a lot more battles for our kids to fight; we just have to teach them all that we can and hope that they become the best people they can be in life! Thank You for Your Time! Deven.
896	3873	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been around for as long as there have been various mediums of art. In many cases, the censorship involves what many would agree is not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then there are other, more serious issues where the censor has deemed certain creations not suitable for a certain audience, or even for a whole country. What is it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lewd in nature? Censorship has been and still is a very useful tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely known cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Communist China, and North Korea. In these countries, all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the welfare of the government are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occurred in Germany, where the Nazi party would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the party's leadership that they would often times freely relinquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing is still occurring in China today, with a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In 2010, the popular search engine Google attempted to set up shop in the country but quickly entered into a dispute with the government about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of China's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the government. During that time, it was reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the government's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship is North Korea; their government has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so-called 'hermit kingdom'. In our home country of the United States, we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries, they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a government for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding? If we as a people were to allow such a blatant restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so, why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers? The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder, 'is it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intelligent art, others of a more deviant nature create some more inappropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography is the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the library's bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It is a reasonable question, one that should be taken into consideration, but in answer to it, I believe that it is and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that brings the child with them. It is simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want is a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what is and what is not acceptable for the general library? As author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Censorship has been around for a very long time and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning government. That is sadly an inevitability that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.
897	3874	2	3	Almost everyone in this world reads. Many people have to read almost every day; people may not realize it, but they do. Reading is just a part of life. If you don't know how to read, you are most likely not to be successful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just knew the basic words, people would probably be fine, but people definitely need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf. Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive, they should simply not read it. Just because it offends them, other people may find it interesting. If people just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. People can be offended in the easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in some way. The same thing with movies; movies can offend people just the same as books. I think movies would offend more than a book would. In conclusion, books, movies, or anything of that matter should not be taken off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this world way too easily. One person may love a book and another person may hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be taken off the shelves for everyone else.
898	3875	2	3	Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today. Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society and should not be tolerated. Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression. The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children. Are there materials that are acceptable for adults but not kids? Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution. Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word. In fact, there is nothing inherently wrong with the concept of censorship. It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise. For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of 'Mein Kampf,' the book that Adolf Hitler wrote as a sort of mission statement for Germany. While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored. People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on Hitler's teachings; it is not the government's place to decide for them. While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not. There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands. If someone understands what they are reading and is able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge or expressing themself by creating similar material. However, the issue changes completely when one considers children. If adults want to view pornography or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business. However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things. Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them. In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development. When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned. If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain. However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations. Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters. Then, it becomes the parents' responsibility to ensure that their child stays in that section. When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there. This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material without taking it out of the hands of adults. Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library. After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material. In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society but must be used very carefully. When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly. However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression. Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves. If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands.
899	3876	2	3	Books can make a very deep impression on whoever reads them, and sometimes these impressions are not appropriate for the reader. Books that are found inappropriate to children or even teenagers should be reconsidered to be removed off shelves that are exposed to children or teenagers. I think that children should not learn inappropriate material if they are not ready to learn about it; in other words, if they are not age appropriate. Books are just one thing; there are also movies, music, magazines, and etc. All of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers. Inappropriate media or information should not be exposed to people that are not ready or mature enough to watch movies or read books that could harm or give them wrong impressions. Children that have read books or watched inappropriate media can sometimes change how they are like. I think that many children that watch movies, especially those that should not be exposed to them, can be negatively influenced. Some of the movies that I have seen have been very inappropriate, and I could not imagine young children watching these movies. This is because I do not think children know as much as we do, so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way. I think that books or media that is inappropriate can change children's childhoods in a negative way. Children and teenagers should also be mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, movies, and magazines. If all the age groups would be exposed to all of the higher-rated movies, books, and magazines, I don't think that would be very responsible on the library's part, or whoever was exposing it. I think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere. Parents would also not appreciate it if their children were reading or seeing something that they think their child should not be exposed to. I think that children are simply not mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, magazines, and movies. It would cause a lot of problems for many people. Many of the children would be doing stupid things that they have seen in a movie or read in a book that they thought was cool or that they should try it. We are already having a problem with pre-teens or teenagers. This is because many of them are exposed to things at an early age they should not see, that affect their actions. There are many actions I have seen or heard of that relate to a book or movie that probably would not have happened if the person was not exposed to it. Children simply are not ready or mature enough to be exposed to everything that books, movies, or magazines have to offer. It can change the way that children think or what they think would be cool to physically do. I think that it is bad enough that a lot of teenagers have been exposed to a lot of these things already. This should be a wake-up call for those who have children. Books should not be exposed to every age group because it would hurt society and whoever is not ready to learn or witness what they will.
900	3877	2	3	Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies. These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials. What about the adults? Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelves in libraries because of censorship is not fair to the adults. Books now are being rewritten so they won't have offensive language in them. 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' is a classic example of this. Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it. This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the African Americans, and if that was altered, the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism. If libraries have books that are censored, they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them. Music is another piece of material that censorship has gotten a hold of. Offensive language is being taken out of songs, and uncensored CDs are not being sold in some stores because of censorship. Some adults like the original songs with the original words. Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean versions of CDs so that there are some that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to. Movies are another piece of material that censorship has taken over. They are being rated G, suitable for all ages, PG, suitable for children seven and older, and rated R, suitable for people seventeen and older. These ratings are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie. Libraries should have all kinds of movies on their shelves. If a twelve-year-old kid wants to watch a PG or rated R movie, he or she should be able
901	3878	2	3	There should not be a certain kinds of books removed from the library. Books should not be taken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. If you do not get the book, remember that other people might like it, as its purpose is just for entertainment. If you do not like a particular book, you simply do not have to check it out. While looking for a book, if you find one that does not seem right for you, just look past it. It will not even be a bother to you. There are a lot of books in the library, so you can easily find a different book instead of just focusing on that one title. There will always be many more books there to look at and enjoy. If you encounter a book you consider bad, just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person to discover than bad books. If other people would like the book, then the library should not take it off of the shelves. It might be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book. Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books. Certain people like certain types of books, and perhaps it was simply not the right section for a particular person to be in. The book could be an interesting book; all there is to do is try it. If anything, the reader might even end up liking the book and check it out. The books are there for entertainment. That is why they have so many different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a children's book because they feel it is giving a child the wrong idea, then they do not have to get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the very same book will be great for their child though. Books should be set out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one person's opinion, especially when all that person has to do is not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember the books are there for the readers' entertainment.
902	3879	2	3	I think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult shows. I can understand and see why they put it on children's shows, to protect young minds from certain content. But like really? You guys will put that stuff on good movies? Or on songs!? What has ever happened to freedom of speech? It seems as though the principle of free expression is being overlooked for content made for mature audiences who can decide for themselves what they wish to watch or hear. This overreach into media meant for adults ultimately undermines the creative freedom that artists and filmmakers are supposed to enjoy.
903	3880	2	3	Dear Newspaper: To begin, there should be censorship in libraries, but people should be of a certain age just to check certain books out. Some people go to the libraries just for books that are considered censored material. These days censorship basically is how you get children or students to just pick up a book that is deemed appropriate. Plus, if the parents allow their child to read censorship books because they think it does no harm to the child, which it doesn't, that should be their choice. Put a restricted section for those aged eighteen and older in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have identification just to solve the age problem. However you do it, the libraries might lose the little money they are getting from the people if they restrict access too much. I know you think censorship should be taken off every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good. That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on their shelves. I'm finished but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out of the libraries and risk their closure?
904	3881	2	3	Now take a moment and go back to high school. Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom? What about fighting for a slave's freedom with Abraham Lincoln? Perhaps getting people into trouble in a small town with Huckleberry Finn? No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it. It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered. What is this though? The author is a person of a different race. The author uses occasional bad words. The author is a woman. This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in public libraries is wrong. The period of Nazi Germany was a dark time. Thousands upon thousands of Jewish people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the Nazi party decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by Jewish authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked? This was wrong. Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others? Let us now look now at what a book, movie, magazine, or song offends with to be censored. A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. It would be pathetic. So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions? One thing is certain, I will not. I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. One day my plea will be heard. Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it.
905	3882	2	3	There are a bunch of very good books at a public library, and you can get all kinds of different types of books. You can get a book on anything you really need, any facts you need to know or anything you want to know how to do; I'm sure there is a book out there that can help you out. Just because a book expresses an opinion you disagree with doesn't mean it needs to be taken off the shelves. Everyone looks at everything differently, and a variety of perspectives is what makes a library collection valuable. If you read, it can help you in many different ways; you can learn a lot just from reading a book. Me personally, I hate reading, so I don't learn much from books. I'm more of a hands-on type of person, as words just fly through one ear and out the other really. It is really hard for me to understand text when I'm trying to read and listen or write and listen, as I lose my thoughts too easily. Nevertheless, the value of books for others is undeniable, and their place on the library shelf should be secure.
906	3883	2	3	My stance would be no, because all of that was history. For instance, say you had something like a KKK document or anything like that. Suppose you had a writing project but needed information for that. You would need information for that task, and that information would have notes, dates, and other things. Historical materials, regardless of their nature, contain factual records that are necessary for research and understanding the past. Removing such items would hinder our ability to learn from history and to comprehend the full context of events. Therefore, access to these materials should be preserved for educational purposes, allowing individuals to confront and analyze the past with all its complexities.
907	3884	2	3	I do believe in censorship, but I do believe that it is not that big of a deal. It should be the parents' job to block materials that they think are bad for their kids. If the material is too bad, then it is the parents' right to make sure that their child does not see it. My point of view on stopping materials like books, music, movies, and magazines is that some things are not meant to be shown, read, and heard by someone of a younger age unless they get the okay from their parents. The view of censorship in my mind is that if someone sees something they don't like, they want to get rid of it, and if it is something truly wrong then yes it should be censored, but if it could be avoided and is small like a word in a book then I say that people should be a little more understanding of it and try to think past it or try to find another path to take about it. If you don't like something then maybe you should not read it or listen to it, and if it is so bad don't let your kids get involved in it. I have never found a book, read it, and found it offensive or disturbing. I have found books that I don't like or are not good but never have I seen something so bad that I never want anyone to read it. If people are going to censor something I think it should be for a good reason not because they don't like the person or they think their idea is wrong, but for something that is bad about an entire race or too graphic for a young age. My point in censoring something in my mind is the right way to look at it; we see it all the time in the real world, people do something because they don't like someone, they try some extreme things to get rid of some bad material, but in any case, there is a lot in this world that people should know about and when I do have kids I will decide whether to block something if I want to and that is how it should be for every family.
908	3885	2	3	If I was given the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries, I would think neither taking the books off the shelf, nor leaving them on are quite correct. I would definitely recommend a voting to take place, in order to figure out what to do with the books. I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended. So I would take at least ten different people with different religions, backgrounds, and so forth, and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books. People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all. That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone. Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.' There are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other. This is the main reason voting is rough, because there's a wide variety of people on earth today. You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because there is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before. Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area. Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, it should be labeled in case someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book. Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now. Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well. Voting is always important and people should notice that. I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in the world today, providing a fair and democratic way to handle difficult community decisions.
909	3886	2	3	When ever has a few bad things being said ever affected how or what people read these days. That's what is hot in this present lifetime. No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on whether certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions. In my opinion, no one's work should be taken off of a shelf due to anything, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionally. Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are too embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast. Finally, everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or CD and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G-rated movies, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated PG-13 and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience. Now that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libraries what is your thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay. You have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topic. If you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you come about this, considering the balance between creative freedom and public sensitivity.
910	3887	2	3	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are used for people's enjoyment. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials. Books give people another way to learn new things, instead of in a class. If the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed. If someone is walking into a library, they have to be responsible. Adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and what's not acceptable. No one has the right to take a book off of the shelf, because they think it's offensive. There are millions of books in the world that people find offensive. There's not one perfect book in this world that doesn't bother somebody. Every single book that is made today has a right to be read. There are people out in the world looking for a certain book, magazine, movie, and even music. That material is helping find the answer to a problem, giving the right decision, and helping someone walk in the right path. The Bible is a book of understanding and knowledge. There are a good number of people who think we shouldn't read it, or even pick it up. Like the Bible says, free will. It's our free will to pick up books we want to read. This principle of choice is fundamental to a free society, allowing individuals to seek out knowledge and perspectives that are meaningful to them, thereby enriching their own understanding and personal growth through access to diverse materials.
911	3888	2	3	Should offensive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, and other media takes away from our fundamental freedom as an American citizen. If you think books should be censored, then think about this profound example. Would they take words like 'hell' or 'damned' out of the Bible because those words are considered offensive by some? I do not think so, as those very words give power and authenticity to the book. Many books, considered offensive, are a crucial insight into history and culture. Taking away these books will limit a comprehensive education. Books should not be censored. A very resonant and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.' The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man. In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently, reflecting the historical context. A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.' While some people were happy with the word change, others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story's impact. I agree with the latter statement. The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known by that term. I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotation, but that is the purpose of using the word. The author used it so that the reader could get a genuine feel for what life was like back then. When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a powerful symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful or historically honest. Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of modern censorship. On television, nudity and strong language is often censored when dubbed inappropriate for broadcast. It should be up to the parent to decide which books their child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch. If the parent sees the book as offensive or thinks that their child should not read it, then they should be the ones who makes sure their child does not read it. The books should not be taken off the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents. Books should not be censored; if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it themselves or allow their children to read it.
912	3889	2	3	Imagine a common scenario, you are in the library looking for a book to read, when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. What do you do? A public library should not have inappropriate items on the shelves where any patron can access them. Censoring libraries is something necessary to protect you and your family from unexpected and unwanted exposure. Libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves without fear of encountering offensive content. The first reason I think that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. Children are naturally curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different from what they normally see. An example I have from my own life is my baby sister. She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' This anecdote is showing that children want to see different and exciting things and if they were to go to the library and see the same safe items then there is not anything to worry about. The first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new and intriguing, which could lead them down an unsuitable path. The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place by staff or other patrons. Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the family-friendly movie you thought it was. What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over? Would that not embarrass you deeply? Well something like that happened to my cousin but she got an inappropriate video from the @LOCATION1. She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened. All of that embarrassment and discomfort could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored and materials were more carefully vetted. The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive to various individuals or groups. Would you be offended by seeing something like that displayed openly? I know that I would be. I would not want anyone to be offended like that in a public space meant for learning. When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother. We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me. I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked. I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other peoples' feeling into account before they offend, which is why censorship in shared spaces like libraries is a form of respect. While some people think that inappropriate material is fine to have in a library I believe that they should find other, more private places for it. Think of your family and how much you love them. Think of what not having a censor on the libraries can cause for their innocence. Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help protect them? Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries for the greater good.
913	3890	2	3	Why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves? That is a ludicrous proposition. There are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely, which is an extreme and unnecessary measure. We all have seen or heard of books that are inappropriate to certain audiences, particularly young children. It is completely understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as: explicit books, magazines, poems, movies, and songs. It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent their access without resorting to full removal. One way libraries throughout the nation can prevent this is by making a completely different section or even having the explicit materials be located in the total opposite side of the library from the children's materials. I know that many libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and childrens materials, but there should be more strict rules and perhaps even physical barriers regarding kids being in the adult section unsupervised. Another practical idea is to have parental permission settings on the child's own library card telling the librarian, when the child checks out a book, where in the library they are permitted to get a book from. For example maybe the childs' parents only will allow him/her to get materials from the children's section in the library; therefore if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless his/her parents are there telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it. This puts the control back in the parents' hands. I know when I was a child and I couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset and left out, but now that I look back I realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing. They wanted me to be a child as long as possible. They knew if I was reading or listening to inappropriate materials then I was growing up way too fast and losing my innocence. I know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me. To conclude, lets keep those filthy books and magazines away from the younger kids through responsible measures. I don't want to see it get banned from the libraries or taken out of libraries entirely; I just want to see parents stepping up to be parents and not letting their young children be exposed to that kind of thing prematurely. It isn't the libraries faults if people's children are being exposed to this explicit material; it's the parent's fault for letting it happen and not monitoring their choices.
914	3891	2	3	Should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves? Should movies you loved and used to watch when you were a kid be gone in an instant because someone finds them objectionable? This is a critical question about our access to media. Magazines are often considered offensive; they always have been, as they get the truth out of celebrities and people and they sometimes twist their words into something totally different from what they actually said. There are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people, replay a bad part of somebodys life, or say controversial things about people. Music is just words and sound, but artists make songs about people that have done stuff in the past, events that some people would find offensive. I have seen a music video about @PERSON1 and making fun of her being in jail, but do I think that should be taken off the computer? No, its entertaining and a form of social commentary. This world needs something to keep us entertained and informed. Imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters, no paparazzi, and no satirical content. We wouldn't know anything going on around the world, and while seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive, I can understand where they are coming from, getting talked about all the time, especially about mistakes you have made in your lives. But thats how the world functions; public discourse and criticism are always going to be a part of everyones lives. So as I have been saying, getting rid of movies, music, magazines, and books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion, cause what would entertain us and make us think if they were all gone from our reach?
915	3892	2	3	Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. This is a freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and to express their individuality and personal opinions. This fundamental right should also include the creation and distribution of books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment and art. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions; that is an inherent part of freedom of speech. In a specific case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she has the personal responsibility not to observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a public tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find it very enjoyable or meaningful. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with the principles of freedom of speech. What they may not like could very well be what others do like and value. So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment and artistic expression be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon or a vocal minority? It shouldn't be. Everyone expresses themselves in their own unique way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy and creative way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people genuinely like that venting person's style and perspective. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style; they can simply choose to look away. Censorship should not be allowed in public libraries. If there was a type of institutional censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy and learn from. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression, which is a core democratic value. There are many famous books that were banned from schools throughout the country for various reasons. Just because an authority thinks something is right doesn't always mean it is right for everyone. Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff, but why keep them from the realities of the real world? Let people out to see what this world is truly like and to experience its various types of art and literature for themselves.
916	3893	2	3	Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that I need to take a step back and argue both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we? Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not. It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permanently be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics. For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of Pokémon cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine? On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessible to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well, with content that was once considered taboo now being commonplace. The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even video games have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.
917	3894	2	3	'You are not eligible to check out this book', says the librarian. 'You are just too young for this book.' To me, censorship laws in libraries are not needed. The common people should have the liberty to check out whatever they please. The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. Everyone takes things in differently, it being said that some are more mature than others. If they want to play that game, or read that book, they should be allowed. The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. Therefore they are held accountable for their own actions. Isn't that how legal laws are carried out? If any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Something that seems offensive to one person but someone else might find that interesting. For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they might say things that offend his or her fans. The people who are not fans of him/her might find it amusing; so should they remove the post because some people don't like it? Someone might like that book, music, movie, or magazine; don't inconvenience them because of a few people. Interests may vary, but a teen might like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws won't let the teen read the book they like because of his/her age, and to me that is unfair. It is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. Censorship laws should be wiped out completely. If you might find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form, just don't read it. Nobody is forcing you to read that specific book; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books. There is a book out there that you will enjoy. In conclusion, certain material shouldn't be removed from shelves if found offensive. Some other people might like that same material. There shouldn't be censorship laws in libraries at all. That is just unfair, and unjust to some people. Its a new time and age and things are different, so people of any age should be able to check out any book they please.
918	3895	2	3	The things we find in libraries shouldn't be offensive to anybody. It's the choice you make whether you want to read it or not. Nobody is making you look at those things if you don't want to. Don't look at it, if you think it's offensive. The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves. Some people like looking or reading things like that. People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like. If that was to happen, then there wouldn't be any library around because anything you get from the library, I bet you can find something offensive about it. People find stuff like that entertaining when they watch or read stuff like that. It would hurt the people that make the books and movies that are offensive because they feel like that's what people want to see. True enough, that's what people want to see as long as it's not affecting them in any kind of way. What we see on a daily basis on TV is offensive things, so if we can sit there and watch it on TV then we shouldn't have a problem reading or watching a movie about it. I see stuff offensive on TV about everyday, but it doesn't bother me so reading a book or anything else like that, I wouldn't care because I'm used to seeing it on TV. Nobody can make you read or stop you from reading things like that, only you can. You don't have to look at it if you think its offensive. It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because that's what we hear and see everyday, and no matter what, some people find that entertaining.
919	3896	2	3	What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of something. Censorship can be a good thing; it could also be a bad thing. Does censorship really help in our society? Actually, think about it, there are still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censorship. How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings. Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows. In some movies you get to choose what you want to watch: the unrated version or the censored version. Well, most people want to watch the unrated version, because it's more than likely more funny and shows more. Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and don't want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version. I would preferably pick the unrated version, because I like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version. Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out a lot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television. Parents don't want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words. That's why most of the time you hardly ever see those kind of shows on in the afternoons; they are usually on at nine o'clock or later. Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows. I can't say that I don't watch shows that have some language in them, nor can I say that I don't watch shows that are all bloody and gory. I do watch them, but I would never watch them around my younger sister! She is eleven years old; I don't want my little sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her. Then she would say well my sister was the one who watched the movie. I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either. Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how. Right? Last but not least, my readings about, let's say books and/or music lyrics. So many books have been banned across the country, because people were offended by them or just didn't want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it. Some songs can't be played on the radio, because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and throughout the song. That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular. I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were. When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and don't let it bother me. Same with songs; the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use. Censorship can be good or bad; it really depends on how you look at things. Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do. My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good depending on the specific situation and context.
920	3897	2	3	I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book. What some people find as offensive, some other people might find it not offensive. I do not think that people should be able to take books off of the shelves just because they are offended. For example, if there is a person of the Jewish religion they might find a book about Hitler offensive. In that sense, if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books, our history of the world will be soon forgotten, and we would be doomed to repeat past mistakes. Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In reality, it was a hard time for the Africans. I do not think that they should take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation? If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries, what do we do about the Bible? Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So how would that work out in the long run? It would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well, leading to endless debates over different beliefs. In reading books as a kid I have found that some things are bad and I do not like them, but I don't believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books. How do you take away from the people that like to read different novels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future if we start removing books based on personal offense.
921	3898	2	3	Older authors love to write grusome stories about their pasts, whether it's fiction or nonfiction. Sometimes those books can get into the wrong hands and end up in the trash or burned by overzealous parents or community members. Other times parents get angry at what they're children are doing and saying, and they normally blame television or other kids at school, rarely considering the influence of literature. Parents don't always look at the big picture and consider all sources of information. Any child at anytime can walk right into their school or public library and pick up an inappropriate magazine, book, or movie, but parents don't usually catch on until it's too late and the material has already been consumed. There are all kinds of books out there and no two books are the same, each containing unique themes and content. Nobody can tell a book is going to be inappropriate just by looking at the front cover, as the content within can be surprising. Even though books are meant to be read, it doesn't mean they should be read by all age groups without discretion.  No book at any point in time should be completely removed from a library, that's just not right and constitutes censorship. No matter how graphic, perverted, or inappropriate a book can get, it should never be thrown away or destroyed. Those certain books are written for people with those kinds of interests or for educational purposes. Even books about drugs should be allowed to be read, some children or adults could be interested in what they really do do to your body and mind, and they'd rather read a book about it rather than trying it themselves, which is a safer alternative. Books about murder should also be allowed to be read, but not by children under twelve, as they may not be emotionally prepared. If people in libraries would just start putting books in organized age groups then there probably wouldn't be any problems with access.  The author should never be blamed for something they wrote, as they are simply expressing their creativity and perspective. It's their own personal thoughts and feelings and most of all it's their story to tell as they see fit. It's how they wanted it to be written and nobody should get mad over that, as artistic freedom is important. The rule should apply for magazines, music, and movies as well, as these are all forms of creative expression. Those people wrote the books, movies, magazines, and music so it should be expressed the way they wanted it to be, without undue interference. Even if the authors themselves thought their own writing was too bad for a child to read, or hear they would make it clear by putting something like, 'not for children under the age of twelve or whatever age they recommend' directly on the cover or in the introduction.  If adults are really getting mad about this then they need to look back at the kinds of things they were doing, saying, or reading when they were younger and maybe it would change their outlook a little on movies, magazines, music, and books, fostering a more understanding perspective.
922	3899	2	3	Walking in to the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people due to their content. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them, as I believe in protecting readers from harmful material. Are you in agreement with this position?  There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex that is too explicit. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people, causing genuine distress. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them in print, finding it disrespectful. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head, potentially influencing their behavior. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people, as it promotes hateful ideas. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book, feeling alienated. Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended and feel their beliefs are being attacked.  There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people more effectively. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there, creating a clear boundary. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that may offend someone, giving them a choice before they read further. It would be very helpful to so many people who wish to avoid certain topics!  In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good, as collections aim for diversity. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inappropriate and those books can be removed to maintain a wholesome environment. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read, which shouldn't happen in a public space. Let's put a stop to it by being more proactive about content management.  In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people, it is almost inevitable. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days, thus promoting a more considerate atmosphere. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading and can enjoy their library visits fully!
923	3900	2	3	I believe that there are certain movies, music, and other things that are bothering parents today more than ever. I would not whant my kid listening to music that has a lot of things that can teach you wether if its write or wrong, I would check the kind of music my child listens to to see if they are bieng tought bad things like violence or misogyny. I believe that there are some movies that are to violent for anyone to see, but this is a free country which us regular average people will watch any way, often ignoring ratings. There are movies made for adults, but how many adults let their kids watch them to, despite clear content warnings. No matter what they make there will be people who dont like what they see or they know somebody who didnt like what they saw, as tastes and sensitivities vary. Some times there are people that dont like what they hear, or knows somebody who didnt like what they hear'd in music or on the television, leading to complaints.  There are times my mom here's something on t.v or music and said turn that of, finding the content objectionable. my friends all listen to this music that i dont think amounts to nothing but the production of inmates, and other wrong doings such as, gangs, fights, shootings, and jurry trials, which glamorizes a criminal lifestyle. there are things on the market that has an error of a certain group who might like action movies, but that doesn't make it suitable for all. Well there are kids out there learning those things they saw, and they are trying to do what they saw, becuase they think that it will make them look cool among their peers, which is a dangerous mimicry. There will always be things that peolpe do not like and will never like, as opinions on media are deeply personal. I learned that when I was young, just like most young kids have, that not all entertainment is meant for me.  I think the biggest thing that sell's, is the dramma, action movies, and the stuff that parents will like, as these genres have wide appeal. Very little of baby movies, and baby music are produced for the mainstream market, focusing on older audiences. But what can you do about that? It is simply the nature of the industry. I like most of what I hear, and see, but I remain critical. I have always thought there was a lot of violence, and picture shots, and things about drugs that just should not be on national television to teach the young, as it desensitizes them. This is what I think about the current state of media and its impact on society.
924	3901	2	3	Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way, sharing fundamental humanity yet possessing individual traits. Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same in thought, experience, or curiosity. As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box, exploring unconventional ideas. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study, stifling their intellectual growth. Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course, to ensure guidance.  Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority by imposing their views on collection policies. Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner, as maturity varies individually. If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever, allowing for personalized learning. Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about historical figures and their horrible plans for the world? A person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present to comprehend the material!  It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day, driving scientific and social progress. As well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today, from medical advances to space exploration. The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future, shaping our world. If these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be to explore and learn without unnecessary barriers.
925	3902	2	3	In most libraries in the country, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children due to their mature themes. These books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing, as it may be confusing or disturbing. However, this does not mean that the libraries of our nation should get rid of these books, videos, etc. entirely, as they serve a purpose for other audiences. The libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of the community like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content from other sources, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational and historically valuable.  When you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were to young, enforced by your parents. Your parents and grandparents would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough to understand the complex themes. They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies, offering deeper narratives. The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them for entertainment and insight. If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library that suits their tastes. They do not want to be reading children's books all the time, as their interests are more sophisticated.  Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies from various sources outside the library. Most of the parents in the country have used offensive language infront of their child without even realizing it, modeling behavior inadvertently. The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if mom and dad use them, or they hear them from friends. Another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game, often at a friend's house. They have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies, so the content is not entirely new. It's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content' in today's connected world.  Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos, providing valuable lessons. For example, historical war films were great movies describing the search for one man in the middle of a major world conflict. These wars actually occured and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars, teaching history vividly. If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened, without sugarcoating the reality. There is no point in trying to hide the truth of historical events, as understanding them is crucial.  Overall, most kids in the country have heard offensive language or seen graphic content through various media exposures. Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it, making library materials just one of many sources. So why would we try to hide this from them in a library setting? Keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the history of the country, ensuring access to a full spectrum of information and culture.
926	3903	2	3	Do you think censorship is going to prevent people from getting offended? Taking items such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., will not stop people from getting offended, as offense is a deeply personal and subjective reaction. The central questions are who decides what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive to one person may be entirely inoffensive or even inspiring to another, highlighting the inherent flaw in any attempt to create a universally acceptable standard for media and expression.
927	3904	2	3	Many people in the community read. Books, magazines, newspapers, and music are a great pastime. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading dictionary books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters. Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You would be baffled as to why all of your loves have disappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to some because only their deity has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears. If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been banned, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My former history teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, some authors' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a buffoon? Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed. For all of the Book Lovers out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction, and the library would lose its soul.
928	3905	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My choice is no. I have several reasons for that; one is that this is a free country and a person has the right to speak on how they feel or what's on their mind. And that should be acceptable anywhere because every one has their own opinion about what they like or read. And if you feel that it offends you, maybe you shouldn't be reading it or watching it or whatever the case may be. You can find something else to read that you'll enjoy or your friends and family might like. My second reason is that you can learn from stuff that may offend you in any kind of way. Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging their pants; many white people that seen their pants below their waist had something negative to say about the young men. They only judge a book by its cover because they didn't know anything about the person that they were talking about, and one of the black males was an honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college. And when many whites started to find out they began to question the young man about how he dress and why. He told them this is a free country I can do whatever I like and whites liked that he spoke up for himself. So with my reason being said I find it not right to remove certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. So I hope you enjoyed reading my essay, and I stand by my view that personal choice, not censorship, is the correct path.
929	3906	2	3	No Censorship. Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to can be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it. The first reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture might find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To Kill a Mockingbird and books about slaves may be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people may love the book because of a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive or not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library. Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like may be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves, I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often. A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they might find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that may be found offensive to them, why would they read the book? Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie. Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions, and the role of a library is to provide a broad spectrum of ideas for individuals to choose from freely.
930	3907	2	3	I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive'. Something that is offensive to me may not be offensive to another. Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate, somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate. The main issues that most people have with books are foul language, sex, and difference in opinion. These three categories are very sensitive issues, and some may not be comfortable discussing these issues. Many books in the library systems today contain foul language. Surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section. I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading, but that is a matter of parental guidance, not library policy. In our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency. Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines. Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions, yet they serve a legitimate audience. Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends. Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree, and libraries should be a forum for this exchange, not a casualty of it. Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way? Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don't agree with what it says? Should there be a censor on what can and can't be put in libraries? I don't think that any books should be taken off of library shelves. If you don't agree with the book then don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they aren't reading something they shouldn't, thereby preserving access for all.
931	3908	2	3	'Censorship or No?' Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I wholeheartedly agree with her. She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world. There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world. There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive. Just because one person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too. I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my English class, we were assigned to read 'The Catcher in the Rye'. As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in a lot of schools all over the country. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned. Just as Katherine Paterson stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the country, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the country, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop. One little law change in America could cause great negative changes in the future. There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, your depriving other people of books. So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults.
932	3909	2	3	Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it? I know I would not. If everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone. You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future. If you ban a book then you are giving up your individuality. If you let someone decide what is offensive to you, then how can you express yourself. Therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom. By banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want. Therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want. There should not be any banning of books. You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press. The freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want. However, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. This means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not. You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press, and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want. If you ban books then you will ruin the future. There are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them. There are books that can change your life, and teach you how to deal with things, and if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems. People turn to books for knowledge, and help, and for ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way. Books should not be banned because if they were then, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future. In conclusion, books should not be banned because, it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. If you ban books, more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned. By banning books you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our individuality.
933	3910	2	3	Do you think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed from a libraries shelf? A library should carry every kind of book, movie, magazines, music etc. The reason that a library should carry every thing is because say a farmer wants to come in and get a book over cattle and some city person says that its no use and throws it away the farmer is outta luck or say the opposite would happen. Another reason would be a persons tasted some people like romance and some like action etc so if they dont carry one type someone will get mad about it and stop going. Say if Person A does not like violence so they take it off the shelf and Person B don't like chick flicks etc what would that leave in a library no one would have anything to read and they would close the library down because there would only be a few books. The movies and magazines i would say carry anything that was appropriate and if it was rated R you had to be 18 to rent it then the person would be a adult. There is different cultures out there that only like certain thing so what are they going to do make separate library's so that each culture will be happy or just build one big library and the ones that dont like just leave the book or whatever there. Ultimately its up to the parent to teach there child not to pick up the bad items if there not liked by a certain family or culture. If they would get rid of the stuff one person didnt like it would loss customers and make others mad so in my eyes its better to have one person mad because a library carries a certain type of item then to loss customers and make ten people or even two to make one person happy when it is as simple as dont pick it up. So ultimately we can not make everyone happy so just look over the items you do not like teach your children not to bring them home and move on in life and dont start a problem.
934	3911	2	3	I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a libraries. I think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to. Just because a person or few people don't like it doesn't mean remove it. They don't have to read that book. If I did like a book i just don't like it. Everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into. Like im in to freaky novels. Everyone I hangout with is not in to freaky novels. In I might not be into what they are into. Like I dislike a lot of love stories not them all just a few of them I don't like. I can say I am in to abnormal stories. I like fiction stories then nonfiction. My most favorite novels is 'The Hunger Games'. Most people would want to remove the stories with bad language or vocabulary off the shelves. I know a lot of people that are into those kind of stories. I think that would be unfair to do that. Why take away what they like in not what you like. Like I am into all kind of sex books. Some people wouldn't want those books on the shelves either. Just by removing someones type of book could make people don't want to read anymore. I know it would make me stop reading if I can't read what I want to read. Now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book. In the results of them not reading anymore. If you do theirs something wrong with you. How would you feel if that was to happen to you. So you all way pose to look at it in anothers persons point of view. You should look at all the positive way first. Like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books. Not only would it effect the reader but the person who wrote the book. You will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people. You would be putting someone out their job. You could mess up someones family of living. You could take away somones beliefs. You can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad. You can drive a person crazy. You can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all. Books could be a way people escape the real world. Reading books could give people more things to talk about. Books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way. I suggest that people should just leave the books wear they are at. Books are way people express how they feel, they life style, and what they been threw etc....... Life is hard in books makes it easier for some people.
935	3912	2	3	No criteria such as books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The United States is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you don't have to read it. When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy, simply because you don't have to go see that movie, or go read that book. Different people find different things offensive, this can be because of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive. Some people think it is offensive that professional athletes get paid millions for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street. Never the less the Super Bowl is the most watched event in the world when it comes on. Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good. Another example is racial jokes, some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive. This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes. Just as Katherine Paterson said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive. People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue. If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it. Almost every single book in the world has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive. If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read. This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not. So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library, just dont read them, because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might like to read that book.
936	3913	2	3	I think all books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say this is because what if their are little children that are willing too read grown up books and its all types of naked pictures and words thats not in a child vocabulary. Then they will pick up bad habits and then use them without knowing what the words actually means, which can lead to misunderstandings and inappropriate behavior at school or at home. Then, I think music should be edited because some music has cursing and talking about things that a young minded child or children shouldn't hear, such as explicit language or mature themes. The music should only be something children are supposed too listen too things that are in their age group, like educational songs or gentle melodies. Next, I believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting our children watch every and anything they want too. Things that doesn't control their language such as certain popular television shows. I believe that one particular show needs too be blocked because they really do and say exclusive things on that show, and a lot of children watch and repeat every thing they hear and see of that show, mimicking actions they do not understand. Finally, magazines...I say the same too magazines because they have naked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that shows just way too much and they put things in the magazines too make them look real when they are actually not, creating false expectations and body image issues. I think that the internet should only be used when needed too research and do homework because children use internet too watch exclusive things and listen too such bad things, which can be easily accessed without proper filters. In conclusion, all together I think it should be a limit too everything we listen too and watch. Because children pick up everything they hear and see, and it is our duty to protect their innocence for as long as possible.
937	3914	2	3	I don't think they should remove anything that's offensive from the library cause honestly, most of the books author publish have something offensive in them. It's not the library's fault, if there's children reading these books that are offensive then that's the parents fault for letting them read them. I've been to the library and listened to music, watched movies, and even read magazines that have some offensive content in them, but if they were to remove all the offensive content from the library, then the library would be half empty, lacking the diversity of thought and expression that makes it valuable. I've seen parents discussing to the librarians about banning content that's not appropriate from the library, but why would it even matter if they can just ignore it and keep it away from their own children. It honestly isn't a big deal when it comes to these type of problems, as personal responsibility should prevail. I discussed this with my mom once and she completely agrees with me. My mom said 'it wouldn't be a problem as of today if they could of just ignored it and focused on what they themselves choose to consume'. Also the music that they have should stay their whether or not its offensive cause people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to, and it is a form of art and personal identity. The movies that are made these days all have inappropriate content in them, whether its a rated R movie or not, and that reflects the realities and creative visions of the filmmakers. As of all the argument going on about library's having offensive content, it should still be kept at the library and not removed. I'm sure a lot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library, finding entertainment, knowledge, and solace within its collections. If children end up listening to the offensive music, or watching offensive movies then think about it like this, they need to grow up someday and learn about the world in a controlled manner. If that's not the case then parents should keep them away from the content, as it is ultimately a parental duty to guide their children's media consumption.
938	3915	2	3	Certain material such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. The quote by Katherine Paterson simply states that if everyone had the right to remove a book from a shelf, then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us. The world of literature would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive, whether for religious, political, or personal reasons. To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all, and may even find it enlightening or necessary. A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion or social issues, leading them to demand removal of works that challenge their worldview. There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by everyone, and attempting to do so through censorship is a futile effort. In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out, from a student researching a topic to an adult seeking a new perspective. That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library, a practical solution that maintains access for all. Adult novels, children's books, science fiction novels all in different sections of the library. This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes and allows them to supervise their children's choices. If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame; the parent, for not providing adequate guidance. Children always wander off into random places because of curiosity, and it is a parent's role to steer that curiosity appropriately. Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such as seeing something that a toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see, but this is a matter of vigilance, not censorship. One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons about history, humanity, and themselves. If those lessons are not taught yet, they will be taught later, often in a harder way. The person might have to live the lesson to learn it, and literature provides a safe way to explore complex themes. That is why some material should not be taken away; it serves as a crucial tool for learning and empathy. Everyone believes in different things, and a library should reflect that diversity. There is always someone that has a different opinion of things, and a public institution must cater to a public, not a single viewpoint. The world contains of many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go; understanding difference is part of education. There is always a choice of what to do and what not to do, and individuals should be free to make that choice for themselves. Someone has to find a way to fix things and in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others, and that way is through dialogue, not removal. Removing material from libraries can cause many things; approval from some, disapproval from others, anger, and happiness. Most of all, it can cause fights and deep divisions within a community, which later on can turn into a war over ideas and freedoms. The material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life, and if people find that wrong, then it means they do not wish to fully experience life with all its complexities and challenges.
939	3916	2	3	Censorship is not an easy question to answer; it involves a great deal of thought and consideration for various perspectives. When thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture beyond immediate concerns. You should think about the aftermath like the thoughts and opinions from everyone else who uses the library. When it comes to censorship in libraries I feel that all the books should be left on the shelves, as a library's purpose is to provide access to information and ideas. So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't? This seems like an unfair solution that prioritizes one group over another. If you don't want a child to look at adult books, then you can censor them by watching them, and not taking them to places that have such books, thereby teaching them responsible media consumption. This way other people can read these books and benefit from the stories and knowledge they contain. If you truly think about it, then you will realize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can, and will, find a way of getting it, often making the forbidden content more appealing. If you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more, fueling their natural curiosity in potentially less safe environments. Books are good for people; they expand the mind and foster empathy. It tells them stories that cannot happen, past events they did not live through, and even the thoughts of others, which is vital for a well-rounded education. Keeping books away from people is not good for them; they would not be able to learn from the things they read and would be sheltered from different viewpoints. So, maybe some books are more racy than others, that does not mean you should hide it from your children; it means you should be there to discuss its content with them. If you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some significant problems for the community. Now you will have no books for some people who rely on the library for their reading material. You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children, ignoring the needs of the adult population. This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library, and people will stop going to the library all together, defeating its purpose as a community resource. So, when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books, and banning them from the library does not erase their existence. Books are good for people especially teens, whose minds are developing and need exposure to complex ideas to grow. In some places books that are banned in other places are celebrated for their literary merit or cultural significance. When trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from, and the value those books hold for them.
940	3917	2	3	You go to a library to read books, listen to music, and look at magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books available to the public. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelves if they are offensive to people. We are supposed to feel safe and comfortable reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines in a public space like a library. When I was younger I went to the library all the time, seeing it as a place of wonder and discovery. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitement went away after a few bad experiences with the material I found there. Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was written and the themes it presented. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused and a little frightened by their meaning and context. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really libraries should only have good books not bad, to protect young and impressionable minds. After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something, but the feeling of discomfort remained. Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelves for good and never to return, ensuring a positive environment for all visitors. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a bookworm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book that's not offensive is all that I ask for in a library, a simple expectation of decency. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be allowed to be in libraries at all, as they contradict the library's role as a safe community space. When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, to get lost in a story or a song. But if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that without encountering something upsetting or harmful? There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines; their presence does more harm than good. In closing to my essay I still have full courage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your niece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say to her? I ask you this, how would you feel knowing she was exposed to that material in a place meant for learning and joy? We must prioritize the protection of young minds.
941	3918	2	3	When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community over a contentious issue. Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in her English class. In these parents' opinion, the graphic rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter. While this seemed a fair personal stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book entirely from the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to @CAPS1 was clearly traumatic material. This crusade of theirs posed the fundamental questions '@CAPS1 can and should be censored? And when?'. As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject deeply. Who had the right to tell me @CAPS1 I could read? Or listen to? Or watch? The answer I came to was a firm 'no one'. No one has the right to censor anyone else. This comes with one clear exception: parents and children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. They must use their best judgement to decide @CAPS1 their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read. This was true in the censorship of @ORGANIZATION1, as well. No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel; it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the significant problem arose. This is precisely why public libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials. Music you love @MONTH1 be offensive to me. Books your @CAPS2 teacher assigned @MONTH1 not be appropriate for five year olds. Your friends @MONTH1 be offended by your favorite movie or @CAPS3 show. These feelings are entirely subjective; almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate. We must, as a society, be able to accept this fundamental truth. We learn throguh @CAPS1 we see, @CAPS1 we hear, and @CAPS1 we read. These experiences teach us @CAPS1 to do, as well as teach us @CAPS1 not to do. Because of this, it would be profoundly unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn and grow. Parents have the right to censor @CAPS1 their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn about the world. We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists. If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn vicariously. Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the very people we wish to protect.
942	3919	2	3	Libraries are a vital source of information for a community. They provide us with valuable research, diverse entertainment, and cold hard facts. Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out. Everyone is faced with choices in life. Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts. Everyday we have choices. We also have significant choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like @CAPS2 might be offensive, then we should just walk past @CAPS2. Most libraries are well organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the personal choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If @CAPS2 does offend us, then @CAPS2's our own fault for choosing it. The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. @CAPS2's always a personal choice. No one puts a gun to our head and says, '@CAPS1 this book or you will die.' @CAPS2 just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to @CAPS1 something we don't want to. @CAPS2's all up to you and how you feel about the book. Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own conscious choice to not watch or @CAPS1 those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see @CAPS2 as perfectly fine to watch or @CAPS1. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because @CAPS2 offends one person should not happen in a public institution. If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? @CAPS2 would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because @CAPS2 contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no fair way to properly censor all your books without upsetting a portion of your customers. I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Some are obviously worse than others; but, when @CAPS2 comes to books and movies, the people generally know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive. There are simply too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display. For these reasons, libraries should not censor the materials they display.
943	3920	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what the wish within the context of their own individual wrighting. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well. If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people who seek them out. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be to a minority. Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art. @ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world. Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used. Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be.
944	3921	2	3	There are many different styles of literature and media in this world. With this variety, it has to please at least one person. If not, why was it made? There come a point when things just become too much. Some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on public library shelves. Media is a huge influence in todays society. What would you do without it? Everyday, everyone is using media related, whether it is turning on the televison in the moring and watching the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' to opening up a magazine and reading about what famous person is in jail this time. You cannot get away from it. Teens @CAPS1 are truely addicted for the most part. We have video games, online chats (facebook and myspace), and moives. Many things we learn from these are not good for our minds and health. Some video games are good to play but when you become wrapped up in them, playing non stop, killing people and laughing at this, here you know there is something wrong. Our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence, so we think it is okay to do. Many people see it as, the movie stars do it, so why can't we? @CAPS1's society is killing our minds and many young people who think their life is miserable just go out and commit suicide. Music can get too extensive as well. Yes, you have you oldies, country, and the jazz but when you add in the rap and heavy metal music, there is no understanding. Rap is all about who am I going to sleep with next and how many times I can have sex. Really, is this what our lives should be focused on? I didnt know people like the thought of a @CAPS3. Heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living? People say that this music helps them calm their anger down. Feeling realived after they have listen to it. You @MONTH1 be clam now but after hearing these words and banging your head around, what is going to happen when you do get extrememly mad? Too many lives are effect by @CAPS1's media and literature. Lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined. Someone is always going to say a certain amount is too much, but I think we need to set a goal of how much is too much and try to save ourselves from this harmful content. We are not like a video game that has seconds lives.
945	3922	2	3	Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them? When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Librarys don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area where materials are curated for younger audiences. Librarys usually don't carry offensive music. They have @CAPS1's for books to listen to. That might have offensive lauguage in it. Before renting or buying the @CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the @CAPS1. Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways, based on reviews or summaries. If movies are offensice they are marked rated @CAPS4. @NUM1 movies are the better ones for families. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you the rating and content description. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @CAPS4 movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see at that age. Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. They also have
946	3923	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be allowed to be shown to the public. If these offensive things were not allowed to be shown, I personally think it would help out our country, which is full of racist people and documents. Every time you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician, you see embarrassing aspects of their lives broadcast all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in their life. If it wasn't for actresses and musicians, we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radios. There would be no reason to, there would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us, and they deserve our appreciation, not our judgment. Books in the libraries should not have sexual assaults in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Especially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them, not vulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school and the values it should uphold. Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child bringing home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from our local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library; it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children's films. She said that the movies should be separate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie, or at least have a parent's permission. Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Let's keep our children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in our school libraries and local libraries, it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and promote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf and protect our children from these harmful influences.
947	3924	2	3	Should some materials, such as books, movies, and magazines, be removed from the shelves if those things are found offensive? There are some things in books and movies that are offensive, and that other younger adults shouldn't watch or read. Reading a book also says a lot about certain topics that are offensive. But at the same time, can you learn from these things such as finding it in a book or seeing it on TV? So I don't think that certain things that are found offensive should be taken off the shelves, because people should learn off of these things. Some people have a hard time understanding what's right and wrong in life, because they're not getting the full effect in life and what it is meant to be. The problem I think is people might not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it means. Movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence. Movies can affect someone, especially someone who is very young. Those children can look what's on TV and copy exactly what they are doing. They also might see a role model which is not always good for some people, leading them to imitate bad behavior. Another thing is that music plays a big role in someone's life because there is sad music, loving music and also violent music. Music can define a person. For example if you are listening to a sad song, you might feel sad or depressed. Or a person listening to hard and violent music might feel upset or angry. Certain music that people listen to can define who they are. Especially when I had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in. I think when people listen to the music he or she likes, it defines who they are, it shows what kind of mood they are in. Secondly, magazines are an advertisement. It shows everything, it tells you stories. Just like in the movies if you see it, you're going to do it. But magazines are different, they show like the styles, and life stories of others. When you see things you might want to do things just as the what the magazine shows. Usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so its not as big of effect as the others such as the music and movies. They more likely describe things and present ideas for consideration. Books on the other hand are similar. You can learn what's in a book just by reading it. So if a person were to read something about violence he or she might think it is right to do so. Even if that particular book is telling you what's right about the topic, the reader must interpret the message. So no I don't think that some books that are found offensive should be removed because only that person or individual can learn what being offensive is. So keeping these types of books might help other people who are readers understand complex issues and learn from them.
948	3925	2	3	What is this country's main idea in the area of art, language, and music? The idea in those categories is freedom. Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person. It is one of the amendments in the 'Bill of Rights', known as freedom of speech. Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the American public. It is their right as an American to buy what they want. It takes away freedom from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see, which is a fundamental right. Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better? I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway. That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive. We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. Columbus had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it. Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking. But he did it, and proved himself right. Galileo Galilei thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the Earth. He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory. The people of where he did his work got enraged and threw him into exile and imprisoned him. After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him. Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the Earth. That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world. It makes people think in different ways and helps people think of new ideas. Freedom is the key to any way of living and progress.
949	3926	2	3	There are a lot of things that you can find in the libraries that you can find to be inappropriate to some but not all people. If there was something that I was offended by then I would ask them to pull it off the shelf. If you have somewhat of a project to do then go to the library to meet some friends and work on it there. If you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it. The library is here to help those that don't have a computer at home; they can go to the library and do their work there, using the available resources. If they would have a lot of their books on a disc or DVDs, movies, tape players a lot more people would want to read more. If that all library had all the same books then they would have more people in and out getting the book they want to read. If there was little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them, a dedicated area just for children. All the library should get rid of the inappropriate books that some of the people write off the shelf so that they don't have people complaining about the material on the shelf. There's probably about fifty to one hundred libraries in the state. I know for a fact that there's something inappropriate on the shelf in all the libraries. There are tons and tons of books in all of the library so there's a good chance there's something out there that someone will find they don't like and ask for it to be taken off the shelf. If they would get a lot of people saying they are offended by it then they would have to take it off to address the community's concerns. There is also a lot of magazines out there that some should not be seen by little kids. If they get one that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offended by that. All magazines should have somewhat of a rating on them. You would have to be older than eighteen years of age to get a pg-18 mag. Some of the magazines should be for little kid that go there all the time and adults. They should have them divided into sections for little kids and adults to keep things organized. They need to respect all the people in the library at that time. I think that there's some of that here in our home town but not one hundred percent positive there is. We all have the right to ask them to take it off the shelf and if they didn't then they well get into trouble for not listening to the public.
950	3927	2	3	Dear newspaper editor, Today I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of our town. This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others. Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers. Its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but its not about what they like. Its about the people in general that have a certain interest towards that subject. Some people have even removed the Harry Potter books from local library systems, deeming them unsuitable. Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. The belief in a religion or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about; sex, drugs or alcohol is removed for just that. If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left would be children's books. Some people would find ways to get those censored as well. We would become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature, losing access to diverse knowledge. There's even an account of a person being fired from their job for reading a magazine on their break at work! What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf? Then another and another, we would have no books in our libraries or stores, leaving the shelves empty. This censorship is a major problem, very few people really care about this subject. Most think it should be done to most items, some think we don't need to censor anything, as we are a free country with rights to choose. So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, 'Would I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again?' Then everyone will know the answer and understand the importance of fighting censorship.
951	3928	2	3	Some books on the library shelves contain material that some may find objectionable, whether due to the subject matter, the presence of curse words, or simply being inappropriate for certain age groups. This raises the question: should the books at libraries be censored, or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read them or not? I do not think any of the books or magazines should be censored. If someone wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that, then they should be allowed to do so. Parents may not permit some kids to read them, but some parents just do not care. I think if children read them, they might repeat the words, but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say. The same principle applies to movies you can get at libraries. I do not think they should be censored either, because parents are not going to let their children get a movie or watch it if they do not think it is something they should be watching. The kids generally know what they can and cannot watch, so if it is something they know they are not allowed to watch, then they should not get it. Even if a child does get it, the parents could always take it away and explain that they cannot watch it. Should all books, magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censored? The answer is no. If it is a school library, everything does have to be school-appropriate. If a book, movie, magazine, or music is not appropriate, then the school cannot lend it out. A public library can stock a wider variety, and there are mostly adults there anyway. Children should know what they can and cannot watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something that is not for them. Some parents may agree with censoring materials, but if you do that, you are limiting the books everyone can read. Even the parents or adults would not be able to read them as well, which restricts access for everyone.
952	3929	2	3	What do you think about books? Do you think it matters how appropriate they are? Well, I am going to tell you my opinion on the books that should and should not be in libraries. I think that there are many different views from many different people on books. Someone just cannot say that they think a book should not be in a library, period. I think that if a book is inappropriate for someone in grade school to read, then it should be available in the high school library or a public library instead. I can understand that some parents may not want to have their kid reading it, but I also think that children are going to hear a lot worse and see worse things in life than what a book is going to contain. I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they do not want their child reading that kind of book. I believe that if a kid wants to read it, then they are going to find a way to read it; parents should not be so uptight about what their kids read. I know that they want to protect their child from seeing that stuff, but it is going to happen one day, so they might as well get used to it. Also, a grade school should not even have a book that would be considered inappropriate for a student in its library, or it should have a parent sign something saying that they are okay with their child checking it out. So in conclusion, if parents have a problem with a book, then they should discuss it with the school. They can just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they do not want their child to check out such books. All a parent would have to do is go into the school or wherever their child is getting the book and tell them that, and it would solve all the problems.
953	3930	2	3	To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views pertaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using, censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be? I do not believe that it is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature, older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age, then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be introduced to real life. It would not be beneficial to them or to society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There may be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, there is no reason we all need to read the same thing. Variety is what makes libraries appealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing their material, thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in this country, and I feel this would go against our values if they were to induce censorship in a harmless library. No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inappropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice. Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feels no need to change what is good.
954	3931	2	3	My opinions on censorship in libraries are that libraries are great places to get information on books such as biographies, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, and other genre books. I do not believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and other things should be removed from the shelves because people love music and they want to get information about the artist who made the songs and information about the artist. Also, people want to learn the lyrics to the song. The reason why books should not be removed from the shelves is because people enjoy reading books and they want to know what the book is about and have some information about the book. Books are very important to people and they need some entertainment other than television. Also, people use books to study, for instance when a book is going to be read and then they are going to be tested on it. The books that are found offensive should only be removed if they cause genuine distress, because people get very upset if they find out that a book is talking badly about them. Unless some people are not mature at all and cannot read books that are not even talking about them. Movies should not be removed from shelves because people love watching movies and they are very entertaining to them. If a movie is very offensive to people, yes, it is probably best to remove the movie because they do not want to watch it anymore. But other movies are not even bad. Yes, some movies have foul language, but people still enjoy them. But sometimes in movies, people hear something and they spread it around the school. Then everybody starts saying the foul language. People just have to learn how to not use foul language when it is not needed. Magazines should not be removed because people love reading magazines, especially sports-related ones. I know I love reading sports magazines because I am a very true sports fan and sports are very important to me other than school. There are very inappropriate magazines that children should not be reading, and they should be removed from shelves. Magazines are also used for different things such as comics, housework, and for ladies, makeup and perfume, etc. People think that magazines are very important to society.
955	3932	2	3	Censorship in libraries is almost a primitive, if not childish, way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who does not let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs parallel with censorship in libraries. A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, feeling no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course, cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library; however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author? There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is a free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out. Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the Dewey Decimal System, but that is about as far as categorization goes. Suppose books were even further distinguished by their location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about historical concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the history and historical aisle of the World War Two section in your library. Problem solved. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I cannot even literally see it. You see, outright removal is not really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I am sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they do not like anymore.
956	3933	2	3	Having libraries is a good thing because it teaches children to learn how to read and get examples from the book or magazine that they are reading or just looking at it. How can they help with children and family members that hardly ever knew how to read and write about them? Some libraries have shelves; some of them don't, which is crazy but also silly to consider. Libraries have books and magazines that are for children and also for adults and even grandparents. How can they tell if there is a position that you have to put your books on bookshelves and on a cart? They would have to have a lot of respect and also a lot of body work to put the things that need to be in the library. Librarians can have more than just books; they can have CDs, computers, and also a table that has coloring pages for children. I think they need to be removed because I wouldn't want my children going in the library and finding a whole bunch of stuff that they don't even know what it is about. This would be a wonderful thing to do; they should not have stuff like that in a library in the first place. The librarians should convince the person that brought those in there and tell them to take them back where they got it from. I would think that they should just put stuff that would usually go into a nice and quiet place to sit down and read, and also there is other options like computers to do your homework on. Librarians can have stuff like that, and that is wrong because children see that all the time; this is ridiculous and uncalled for, as that can teach them bad stuff they shouldn't be doing. How can they tell if they should convince them to not have inappropriate things that should not be in a library, things that children should not see? They could take a book home that they don't even know what it is about or what might be in it that should not be in it. I think they should just take everything that is inappropriate and just send it somewhere else where it belongs instead of where little children can reach and learn what's going on, ensuring the library remains a safe and proper environment for all.
957	3934	2	3	'Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines?' Why do people take these books? Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be censored or 'banned'. Why do people believe this should happen? Well there will be three topics that will be talked about in this essay. The three topics are children, society, and religion. First, 'children'. Many parents themselves don't want their child to be exposed to violence, vulgar language, or even possible drugs. Violence is one of the main problems to do with all four of these types of entertainment. Influencing their child could cause a loss by doing things as far known as stupidity. Another is vulgar language; to adults from a generation above us, they take it as being disrespectful. News wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them, causing an overdose that could lead to death. Second, 'society'. Many people going from black to whites to everyone around the world with different colored skin or more different type of features as one another. Here starts racism, meaning against ones color or their ethics. Now to this day it has been calmed down but there was a time that certain words labeled certain people showing that they were less than others. Leading this to riots and gang violence to earning respect. They want to be treated as an equal not less than others that which our ancestors did them in the past. Third, 'religion'. Religion is pretty big in the world and shows a lot about the past and what certain people believe in. Religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects. Everyone believes theirs is the right way and someone else's is the wrong. They cause conflicts in between one another. So trying to keep them from being banned isn't going to help for religion matters, because people do talk and some people out there want to change certain people to believe what they think is right. So back to the question: would everyone or some take to these books, movies, music, magazines? Well it's going to be exposed sooner or later. Options are let it happen now or let it happen later. The sooner could be better or for the worst. Either matters just let happen what happens, someone will learn from their experience so why ban now?
958	3935	2	3	Leave controversial materials on the Shelves. In every library it is entitled to have all types of books, movies, and magazines. Even if they are good or bad. Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings. If there are people that are offended by what types of sources they find in the library, I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone is able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like. If the library didn't have diverse materials, how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certain books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read them or watch them because there might be other people who would like to read them or watch them. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is supposed to have all types of sources. Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books, movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library because if they are offensive to some people, they aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldn't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see what's new, or watching all different types of movies, and listening to music. I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves, and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, movies, or magazines that would offend people today. Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on purpose for people to feel offended; they leave them for other people to read. With this being said, all types of books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about, fostering a space of free access and discovery for all patrons.
959	3936	2	3	I think that they shouldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books, not the little kids, because they don't need to hear the kind of words in the books. Also, the little kids have ears too small to hear and also eyes too small to even see the words in a book like that. The bigger kids, like in grades five and above, should be able to look at the books because it will be words that they have heard before. The books shouldn't be in the lower grade libraries because the little kids will check the books out of the libraries, like the books that are called 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' because it says the n-word a lot of times; another one is 'Of Mice and Men' because it says a lot of dirt words like the f, s, and etc., words that they don't need to hear that young of an age. Another reason why it would not be fair to the bigger kids if they take them away from the libraries is because they are trying to get them out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home and read at home. If you are going to take away the books, take them away from the grades K-3 because the book called 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', and 'Of Mice and Men' will be bad for those kids to read. Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why the little kids shouldn't read the books: why should the bigger kids in grade five and above read them? Because they are bigger then the littler kids are. The littler kids shouldn't because we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to their mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, and etc. Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newspaper about my reflecting on why or why not we should get rid of the censorship in the libraries. Also until the next time I write again about this topic, and I hope you like this persuasive essay for the newspaper and consider the importance of age-appropriate material placement.
960	3937	2	3	Picture for yourself you, as a ten-year-old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, in ancient Athens. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' Why? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, it's unnecessary. Here's why. Fundamentally, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next time you look at a copy of 'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger; is it really that offensive to you? When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because it's of some educational value to you. Books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' provide a huge educational value because they show what Southern culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in America because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness. There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, it's just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problems are that there are people who wanted to read this book but can't because you thought it was offensive. Then this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. Then you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what it's about, making the ban worthless. I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that banning these things is wrong and ultimately counterproductive to the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.
961	3938	2	3	I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own separate room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers getting into those kinds of books and magazines then put a lock on the door and if you have proof of age that shows you are eighteen or older then you are going to be allowed back there; if you don't have proof of age then I guess you're not going back to the adult section. I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not allowed to be seen unless you're eighteen, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures in your mind just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be eighteen or older to go back there and look. I bet it's rough when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then that's just going to cause a bigger problem than what you started out with. People have to understand these days that kids are growing up way too fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think you're smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand it's only a word but it's disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inappropriate things to nice people. When kids do that then other parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think 'wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that it's never going to stop but it would be better if children's parents did not let them cuss around other people; okay at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train it's all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies. I'm going to close this little description now and I'm still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen.
962	3939	2	3	There are many inappropriate types of entertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of entertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inappropriate. With censoring materials in a library it will extremely limit what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches its prey was offensive then if a person was interested in learning about that topic they would not be able to. Many people's only way of research is at a library, so if they had an assignment for work and they could only get information on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offensive. Also people in the medical field have to watch many movies demonstrating certain procedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a person's life. With censoring there would be no diversity. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choice in what we could read for entertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for entertainment because if one person does not like a certain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to choose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefore making the diversity very small. I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inappropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and I believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, hatred, sexual things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring might hide that for a small amount of time but it's not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society. I do not think that we should censor things in our libraries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communities. It is a great idea but I do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cause a lack in diversity, education and a realization of our society.
963	3940	2	3	Now, one way or another that certain piece of material will be found and be used. Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others. So really, either way you might try to remove any material that you think is offensive but is it your right? I don't suppose so, I would consider that unfair. It's unfair that you were able to see this material and just because you thought it was offensive, it does not mean that others might find that offensive in their opinion. So the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous. For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an American for the author of that material. Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers, readers, listeners, etc. to look at and use, would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive. It's a big world out there, you think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see, that no one will find a way, people will always find a way for it to get out or be found. It would be as if you're trying to control what people should be viewing, listening, reading, etc. Almost as if you're in control of people, but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world. Also that not everybody in this world has the same mind set as you do, and that what ever you find offensive might not, or actually does not mean everyone else does. So this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or a group of people find offensive. Do not try to control what people or children should view, listen, or read because it will be found sooner or later. No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect, reality is that it won't happen and you can't keep everything hidden.
964	3941	2	3	Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive. Like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelves. It should be the parent's choice to decide what their child can look at or listen to. But nowadays when a child's parent or any other authority doesn't let them do, watch, or listen to something it makes kids want it more. Since they want it more they will find a way to do, watch, or listen to whatever it may be. They will even go behind their parents' back and probably won't care if they get in trouble. With this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. Computers, television, and the radio are three different major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents I do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age. That is what makes kids think it's alright when their parents do whatever it may be. So let it be the parent's choice of what their child can see. Cause either way they are going to be able to find a way to get it.
965	3942	2	3	To start this off, I am going to say Katherine Paterson is saying what is correct. There is a lot of people around this world that is very sensitive about the things in their house and around their life that they wouldn't want anyone to touch or be around. One important thing that I have that means so much to me & my family is the record that my grandfather gave to us right before he passed away. Me & my family have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time. But we just can't get the nerve to do it. We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that record and just grab ahold of it. So me and my sister do not like that. We say something. That's one thing that we do not like for anyone to touch because it means so much to us! Most people think we are crazy because we do not like anyone to be around or touch it, but all I have to say is that there is other people around this area that is more crazy about their things being touched. For example: 'Don't be over there by my clock hanging on the wall I don't want you to knock it off, so get away from it!' That is something that my best friend's mother had said before, and she still feels the same way still to this day! But I mean it's just how we feel about everything around us that means a lot. But to get back to the situation about why do people get so frustrated about things that are hanging on the wall, or things that are in cases and that's where they have been for years and years, it's because it means so much to them. It's not just cause they're mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe. It just because it means so much to them, and when I say means a lot to them, I mean a bunch, bunch!! They're just trying to say that it means more than anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered. Just try to understand what they're trying to say to you because it could mean so much, and you could get to the point to watch out for it also, just to help out. But the story that Katherine Paterson had wrote is saying the right thing, and she also probably has things in her life too that means a lot to her. You just have to recognize what she has that is so important because there is a lot of people that have important things in their life, and you could be one of them. Just try to see and feel how a lot of other people do around the world around you. You just have to remember what's important to someone and help keep an eye out with them and be a good friend to everybody else.
966	3943	2	3	What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library, enjoying the quiet atmosphere and the variety of resources available. If you do think a particular book is offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book; the choice is yours to make. Everybody has their own ideas on what a library should be, and if they want their voices heard, let them speak it out at community meetings or through formal feedback channels. What I think about all this stuff in the library these days is that it is good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library show me that there is a lot more people in the library now and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.  Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it, which limits access for everyone. But people sometime can take it too far and do sometimes burn it to the ground, destroying a vital community resource. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing to stop the destruction.  The most valuable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down your home; this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together, even if it often goes unheard. That if you do something that make them feel better, that would be really good to them and show you care about their future. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through, and it is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go when the library is gone.  If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard around the world and have the freedom to let it come out through peaceful and constructive means. You have three different voices: your own, other people that do or don't agree, and you have your children who depend on your choices. So which one are you going to listen to when you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one for the entire community?
967	3944	2	3	Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world, thereby letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these precautions to facilitate this? In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people committing suicide, being murdered, government scams, and even terrorist attacks, its hard to keep people that shouldn't know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch television or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we don't think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magazines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, music, and videogames available for checkout.  I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card filing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for, which is a responsible approach.  When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library, perhaps a restricted access section for adults. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called 'The Meaning of a Word' its by a man with the last name of Johnson. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It may be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldn't say it, providing valuable historical context.  Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don't care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library and can make an informed decision for their own family, which places the responsibility back in their hands.
968	3945	2	3	We all find things offensive, whether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and some people may or may not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left, and the shelves would be bare.  Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are inappropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it may not be the writers at fault here. It may be the readers and their individual sensitivities. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading, and could focus more on the educational value.  Yes most adult things now are inappropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies, carefully curated for their age group. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section and guide them appropriately. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that, as the system is designed to help them. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about them reading or watching something they should not be; that is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that supervision.  If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be ok if they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong and understand complex themes. Parents can not always control what their children do, and if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they might see it in a different way than their mother or father did and they might even learn a very valuable lesson from it, gaining a new perspective on the world.
969	3946	2	3	When going to a library you expect to see various books, movies, music, magazines, and maybe other items. If a person is looking for a book that maybe could be offensive to a race, culture, religion, or etc., they should still be able to check out that book. Libraries shouldn't be able to control those situations, because it's a persons choice or adults choice to read those kinds of stories and form their own opinions.  In our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the Constitution. The First Amendment includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters without fear of government reprisal. If a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual, technically by the law they have the right to do so. I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel, but by the law its ok for people to want to read, listen, or watch those works, as that is their protected right.  Libraries are government funded organizations. Therefore meaning they don't have the right to disregard these works or remove them based on subjective offense. The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library, using public funds. This means they need books that people would want to read, and be interested in even though some groups of people might not agree; its their job to serve the entire public, not just a select few.  I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the United States we are allowed to listen to what we want, and read anything we want, because thats what our country is meant to stand for: freedom. When I think of America I think freedom, and i have to say I'm proud our country stands for that, and we should stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life, like choosing a book from a public library.
970	3947	2	3	You ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries. Well ok then I will, you may not like what I have to say but I really dont care because if it was up to your dam government to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do, they'd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldn't learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs, and that is not freedom.  Now the way I see it is that we have every right to read any book we please when we want to read it. Now if we don't want to read a book then we don't have to read it, it is a simple matter of personal choice. But we as a people and they as a government do not have the right to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want no matter what they as in the government thinks; it is the people who run the state not the dam government, and we must remember that power.  My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our history, and our world. Books teach us about what is wrong and what is right, helping to shape our moral compass. Books are here to give a scary story by a camp fire; they are here to give kids a bed time story, creating fond memories. If we take those books off our shelves, you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait; the next one will be worse than this one I promise you that, as they will be deprived of essential knowledge and imagination.  Now it is our right to save our books, because if we do not then us as a society will be lost, adrift without our cultural anchors. For without books our past is lost, our folk tales are forgotten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without their stories to comfort them.  Now come on guys, as a whole we need to pull it together. If you see a book on the shelves and you think its offensive, then by God put the dam thing down and walk away from it; don't complain about it. No one told you that you had to read it, so don't ruin it for everyone just because you disagree. Either you don't believe in God and you think that the bible's not right then don't touch it. Its the same way around; if you do believe in God and you think that all books that tell about a witch or vampires or that may even have a whore house in it, just leave it alone. Its just a dam book; let us read them. See, you guys blame us kids, saying that the video games rotten our minds, but really its the parents that don't see there is nothing more a teenager like myself loves to do more than to do something their mom or dad says not to. So just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do, and trust that we can learn and grow from the experience.
971	3948	2	3	Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them. Others do not. For me I dont. I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people. If a person took offense from a book or magazine I believe that person should just put it back and choose something else. If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves there would be no books on the shelves because I'm sure there's atleast one person in the world that would take offense to each book. There are a lot of people in the world after all, and personal taste varies widely. For music there's different types also. There's rap, country, rock, pop and many more. For example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country. If that person doesn't like country though it shouldn't be removed because others may like country and want to listen to it. For movies there are many different types. There's horror, comedy, romance and many more. That's why at the theater there's different rooms for different movies, allowing viewers to select what suits them. People always have a choice. Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them although some don't. Every person is different. People like different things. That is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature and the reason why a wide selection should be maintained.
972	3949	2	3	The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere. The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people, containing vulgar language or violent themes. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to. The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of. If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want. Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This may be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to? Although to some people this argument could go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world will come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want, leading to a more considerate cultural landscape.
973	3950	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials , such as books, music, movies,magazines, and so on should be removed? Yes I think that they should all be removed, becuase it could hurt people's feelings, and could make them do plenty of things. Such as suicide, drama, and so on having any of these things at a library could hurt someone's feelings. I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else? I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better and prevent unnecessary pain. From exsperince in the library last week, I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american, and the book said something about thier race. And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again. I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me, that kind of thing would just ruien my day. Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock to protect their visitors. Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience. I think that they should take my advice, and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids,teenagers, or even adults that they should not be reading that stuff. All it does is bring some people down, make them cry, and also do stupid stuff. Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart, and make things better for everyone by creating a safer and more positive environment.
974	3951	2	3	Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology. A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that might interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want. Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they might not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought.  Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn.  By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn. We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology.  However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish, limiting their potential for growth and understanding.
975	3952	2	3	First of all i believe if its on the shelf you should be able to get it, no matter what your age is. Yeah theirs thing's that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not. If kids arnt alowed to get certant material on the shelfs, Then it shouldn't be their, in my oppinion. Parents might think differnt, parents might think only certant things should b alowed at a libray. It is not their choice though. Anything is alowed to be at a libray to provide a wide range of information. If you dont want your kid reading or getting certant thing's, then when your kid goes to the libray go with them. Help them pick out a book that is appropriate for your family's values. In conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf. Kid or if your an adult. If your not alowed to get, then why is it their? I dont know i couldnt anwser that question, other than why is it their? That is my oppinion though, and I think access should be universal for all library materials.
976	3953	2	3	"""Are you reading?"" asked mom. I immediately hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parents don't like for their kids to read some content, believing it is too mature or contains inappropriate themes. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There are some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying our parents, and coping behavior from books that might encourage rebellion. There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and reflect actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed, even if those things are negative. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media, which often glorifies bad behavior. It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't necessarily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best interest to remove materials that are offensive or contain violence. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch, keeping our minds focused on positive influences. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decision at home to not become involved in such things. I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likely to model after them and do the thing they do. Let's say I was a fan of a certain actress and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it is considered cool. If I did the things a famous criminal done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got lucky somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure. So in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraries because it insures the well being of students and protects them from things they don't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censorship in my school because I would know it is only there to help me and guide my choices. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or books, and that censorship serves as a protective barrier."
977	3954	2	3	I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, because it's not fair to everybody. If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining about different topics. I have a few reasons also why I think there should not be censorship in libraries. My first reason is freedom of the press. In our Constitution, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our fundamental rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read, as it stifles creativity and open discourse. Another reason I have would be freedom of speech. Also written in our Constitution of the United States, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our constitutionally given rights, just because some people are offended by books and things of that nature. A personal experience I have was one day my friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the 1800's and slavery. Unfortunately, my friend was African American, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment and the material we had to read. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then, with graphic descriptions and illustrations. My friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, 'Why don't you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' My friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard from the librarian. After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right. 'What's that?', he said. I said, 'Because if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, since somebody would find something hurtful in almost any topic.' 'You know, your probably right,' he said, realizing the impracticality of trying to please everyone. Censorship isn't fair, because it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy. It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say, as we all have different perspectives and sensitivities. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours got taken away simply because someone else disagreed?
978	3955	2	3	Some people often go to the library to check out books, movies, magazines, etc. But what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people or certain groups. I think that everything that's in the libraries should stay there. Obviously the library allowed it there for some reason, such as its educational or historical value. So honestly it can't be that bad, or it wouldn't have been acquired in the first place. I do not think certain things should be removed from the library. People have to realize that that's life. There's going to be certain things that you don't like but you have to deal with it and learn from it. If you watch tv you'll notice that there's some offensive things towards certain people, but no one really makes a huge thing out of it on a large scale. The books might be offensive to you but to someone else it could just be another book that they want to read, with no intensive purpose of offending anyone. The library is all about learning and expanding one's horizons. Everything is for educational purposes, even if the lessons are difficult. I've read books that I stopped and thought about for a second while I was reading it and noticed that there's some pretty harsh things in it, depicting violence or injustice. But I didn't complain about it, I just kept reading to understand the full context. A lot of books are based off of true events so no matter how offensive they are to people, you just have to think what the purpose was for the author to create this book, and same thing with movies made from historical events. So people can see what the author has to say and learn from past mistakes. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion, and that's a cornerstone of our society. And that's what most magazine articles are about, expressing what you think about a certain topic from a particular viewpoint. Even in the English class that I'm in now we had to read 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. Some African American people might think it's racist but it really isn't. The author is trying to get his point out, which is about racial injustice and moral growth. He shows how things use to be before white and colored people were treated the same, which is an important historical lesson. Now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then that's alright, as you are entitled to your feelings. That's why this is a free country. Everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it, as long as they are not inciting violence. So I hope I got the point across that it's alright for some things to be offensive towards people, as offense is often subjective. As long as that's not the whole point of what you are watching or reading, which I doubt it is in most library materials. So next time your reading or watching something that is offending you, think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across. Maybe by it offending you it is getting the point across about a serious issue that needs to be understood.
979	3956	2	3	Censorship can be a very good thing when applied judiciously. It keeps inappropriate material from falling into the wrong hands, such as young children. It also keeps the horrors that are in the censored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in, especially for families. But too much censorship can become a bad thing, leading to a lack of information and stifled expression. For instance, Nazi Germany had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books to control public thought. There are also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book Fahrenheit 451. Libraries should censor some of their material, but must be careful not to go too far. Books and magazines need to be censored according to their content. Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get their point across. If a book is using vulgar and inappropriate language it should be in some way censored, perhaps with a rating or restricted access. With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog without any warning. I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine that is readily available to young readers. Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore, which can be disturbing. Magazines and books also use pictures to help get their point across. If there are inappropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored or placed in a restricted section. If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting out with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy and its appropriateness for a public space. Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inappropriate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy regarding graphic content. Also if a magazine has an extremely violent picture or extremely gory picture it should be censored to protect sensitive viewers. Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inappropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored or access should be limited. Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored. Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people. If that artwork includes swear words or inappropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored, perhaps with a sticker or a cover. Musicians also play music of course. But if the lyrics to their songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be censored for a general audience. Someone should not have to deal with wading through music like that in a public, tax-funded institution. No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inappropriate, it should be censored or not carried at all. Movies are most likely the hardest things to censor. This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video, combining multiple media forms. Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inappropriate for certain age groups. If a movie is rated R it should not be in a public library without restrictions, or perhaps not at all. Movies that are rated R for sexual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored or access should be controlled. A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library without parental consent. Also depending on how violent and how gory a movie is it should be censored accordingly, with clear ratings displayed. Movies that are inappropriate, especially ones rated R, should be censored to maintain a family-friendly environment. The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad, but it is necessary in our diverse society. But it does so we must censor certain things that people might get offended by if they saw it in their public library. Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence should possibly be censored or have restricted access. There also needs to be a line where we stop censoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left, as almost any book can offend someone. But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries to balance community standards with intellectual freedom.
980	3957	2	3	As an individual and based on what books I have read, I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf, or at least their access should be limited. My concern is primarily for the children who get a hold of these books without proper context or maturity. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things, such as complex adult relationships or graphic violence. This also includes music, movies, and magazines, which often contain content not suitable for young minds. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder, by normalizing or glorifying such actions. The less obscene material we have readily available, the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway, guiding them towards more positive influences. We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault on the news and in our communities. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you; they show it in movies, they talk about it in books in great detail. There's even songs about it, celebrating a criminal lifestyle, so no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we might see positive results in youth behavior and attitudes. Like I said before, kids should be kids and be free of these obscene materials for as long as possible to preserve their innocence. They will be exposed to it sometime in their lives, but hopefully when they're older and better equipped to process it critically. In the mean time, censors should be put
981	3958	2	3	Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldn't have? Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, and magazines, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living and can shape a child's developing mind. Let's start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not want my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at a young age, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There are also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that might be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days I for sure wouldn't want my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people and create racial division early on. Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about stealing on it. Thats another thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries where kids can access them freely. The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any circumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't appropriate for schools to have available for students. The last one is magazines. There should not be magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble, or lead to inappropriate behavior. Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library and why some materials need to be restricted.
982	3959	2	3	If there is any books, movies, music or magazines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them, perhaps in a separate section for adults. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is necessary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials to protect their innocence. There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to. Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definitely stay off the shelfs. Unless it is just grown ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house, younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room. Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the lyrics. If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse music away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around. Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not necessary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There might be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them to avoid early exposure. I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults. So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult, but with clear boundaries. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive. Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they aren't suppose too, and this is how we safeguard their upbringing.
983	3960	2	3	In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, etc., to extreme levels which can be troubling. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, etc., would have to be scary and confusing for a young mind. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are and can be quite harmful. Would you want your child, that's twelve, to go out and do what the other twelve year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do? Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit, and may actually help them. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss, which are not acceptable behaviors. I know that my mother worries about me as a teenager, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if I had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then I bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyberspace or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not acceptable or necessary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities, a life that is fulfilling and good. So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldn't be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong, guiding them with a strong moral compass. Lets make these profanities go away on their own by choosing better media. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either, setting a proper example for them to follow.
984	3961	2	3	Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread it to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating it anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over. Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about it. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding it offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library. Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive by a single standard. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and it's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because it contains 'offensive material.' It's ridiculous; it infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think it could get into the hands of a child, or someone that it would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are separate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items, which is a sensible solution. How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have it banned so that other people can't enjoy it. If you find something offensive, just leave it alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with it. It's not only disrespectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created it. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, it doesn't have to voiced in a way that restricts others. We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think it's appropriate to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, it's mediocre to report something just because you do not agree with it. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If it weren't appropriate, you honestly think it would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere in daily life. To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because it is offensive to some. We as citizens have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if it does offend someone else, because art should not be constrained by the most sensitive person's views.
985	3962	2	3	Imagine that a person comes up to you and says, 'What is that you are reading there? Wait, I know that book! That book is absolutely offensive! How dare you read that!' Then, imagine that they snatch that book up, and you never see it again. This is an example of how censorship works. If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to grab it away? No, not in any way do they have a right to do that! Everybody should be able to decide for themselves what is right or wrong to watch, read, or hear. Nobody has to be exposed to anything that they don't want to. Also, if a person truly wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they will find it, no matter if it is legal to or not. Therefore, I believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action that wastes resources. Remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story, 'How The Camel Got Its Hump'? Well, you can't read it anymore, the government declared the book offensive to camels and took it away. Now, you have only a boring book on facts about camels. What fun is that? And I have to think, 'What about the authors?' Another thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression! Stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel. Writing a great story is near impossible to accomplish with limitations that could result from government censorship, stifling the artistic spirit. If a song is beautiful and sweet, but contains one bad word in it, is it a bad song? If there was censorship, who would decide what is appropriate? Would the government decide for us? Or would a committee get together and read aloud the books before they were declared inappropriate? Personally, I would love to decide for myself. And, as a mature adult, I can. I have the morals and the mind to choose for myself what is good or bad for my own consumption. Perhaps, the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether. It is possible. It is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment. This could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated, creating a cultural desert. So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment that satisfies everyone? Understanding that there are young, fragile children, that are privy to all forms all public entertainment, some censorship might be required to protect them. However, I strongly believe that this should be limited and carefully applied. The censorship should be used only to help the kids. This is similar to
986	3963	2	3	Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves due to space and budget constraints. Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves and express their unique perspectives. If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding? Such control would stifle the very creativity that fuels cultural growth. Libraries should not have the right to censor material. One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections into genres and topics. Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice for patrons seeking a quiet environment. It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book by organizing the collection logically. Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned by an authority. If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today culturally and artistically. If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone in their personal or intellectual development. Censorship holds back many artists true potential and limits the diversity of available ideas. Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world by restricting their access to a full spectrum of information. I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference in their value as reading material. Many things interest different people, and that diversity of interest is what makes libraries vital. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left, rendering the library empty. Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else who might have benefited from it. Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something, hindering intellectual freedom. As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right, leading to chaos. Censorship shouldnt be in libraries as it contradicts their fundamental mission to provide access to information and ideas.
987	3964	2	3	Is it offensive? This is a question with no single answer, as perceptions vary widely. Should people have the right to take down other people ideas? What do you think; I think so ? for centuries people have been writing,making video,and, all types of music, expressing a vast range of human experience. Some consider it a freedom of speech, a fundamental right in many societies. Others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy against established norms. I believe @CAPS1 are exceptional writers and promising producers and artists, creating works that resonate with many. But not all medias are good or beneficial for every audience. Over a vast amount of time young children have been influenced by medias such as:books,movies,music,etc...Its perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media they deem harmful. But thats not all @CAPS1 are more cases than just children that are suffering theres also religon, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups, all of which can be negatively portrayed. @CAPS1 should be a certain rules and certains laws that are against such wrong doings to protect vulnerable groups. But everyone is entiltled to @CAPS1 opinion, which makes creating universal rules difficult. Hundreds of people are discreminated because of what they here and see in the medias, which can reinforce harmful stereotypes. A life changing expierience for me was the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This could be considered offensive to lots of peolpe such as those of the african american decent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse, as it might depict painful historical events. This is just a few issues with freedom of speech ,but @CAPS1 will always be disagreements and differennt views of oppinion, which is inherent to a diverse society. But I for one believe that theres just certain stuff that shoukdnt be allowed to be put out in to public media because of its potential to cause significant harm or spread hatred.
988	3965	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2 @CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book? It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive. To this I disagree strongly. The world @CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field for accessing information. Some information @CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself, which protects our liberties. Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech, to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country and its founding principles. To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint, ensuring both access and responsibility. Our country has many problems, but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6, the document that guides our nation. In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech. This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter, as protected by law. This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips, which is essential for an informed citizenry. There was just an example of this, inside the @LOCATION1,when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6. However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some, as that would be arbitrary. The world @CAPS5 a contantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant, including social and moral standards. This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types, which evolves over time. No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future, as attitudes shift. At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation. The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten, particularly through digital means. The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad, making control challenging. To block all of this information just can't be done effectively, but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope for managing exposure. To to create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections, similar to other age-restricted activities. A perfect example of this would be off of '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher. That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age, balancing freedom with protection. As humans we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading; it is fundamental to our nature. To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential for growth and understanding. Many things are offensive, but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive, and we must learn to navigate this reality. Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information, a cornerstone of our democracy. This @CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them, requiring careful judgment. We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children, a dual responsibility. To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want, and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians, thus respecting both individual liberty and parental authority.
989	3966	2	3	I'm ok with censorship on reading materials to a certain degree. I understand that the poeple selling the prodects want to appel to the eye and make poeple buy what they are selling, which is a standard marketing practice. I have alot experience with this because I read alot of car magazines and they sometimes have alot models in them, but I'm your avage seventeen year old and I'm ok with this also, as it doesn't bother me much. but there is a lamt to what I find acceptable. My school is very good about this they see one flag it and put it in the back , but they still let you read it if you ask, which seems like a fair compromise. I like this because it keeps the bad apples off the self and out of general view, yet available for those who seek them out. I have a very good kinship with my mom and dad they do tell me I can get certain magazines, but if it's nineiy-five perent cars and only five perent models they are ok with that, focusing on the primary content. I said a thing about limt earlier. All things have a limt like how much hosepower stock parts can take on a car before they break, which is a mechanical reality. I have a limt on what I buy sent I'm not yet eightteen I can only car magazines but don't get me wong I love cars and have sent I little, so my interest is genuine and my acceptance of some content has its boundaries based on my age and values.
990	3967	2	3	What is offensive? How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs, shaped by unique life experiences. So how are we suppose to know what offends who? It seems an impossible task to create a universal standard. The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination, as these attack a person's core identity. Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure because sensitivity varies from individual to individual. Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, a principle enshrined in many constitutions. People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want, which is a reality of a free society. People need to come to sence and understand that consept of mutual tolerance. If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item; personal choice is key. No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them, as we all have autonomy over our consumption. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases, especially in matters of media and information. Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, given the vast diversity of human opinion. but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? This is a challenging ethical question. So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it without imposing personal restrictions on the creative output of others.
991	3968	2	3	Isn't there a saying in the world called 'it's a free country'? I thought it was there are a lot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is; the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lies about the world we live in. From the media to the press to paparazzi, maybe even from the people around you, they all contribute to the spread of things that should not be seen by the people. There are things out there that we the people don't know nothing about, things that the government and the world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are shown by the world, like the case of @PERSON1; a lot of people think what happened to him is offensive. Not only that but racism in general, and also the news: why would people put violent things on the news like murder stories and kidnappings and robberies and many more? People find that offensive and even scary to a lot of people, but yet we keep it on there. So no, I don't think it should be removed from shelves and or wherever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supporters and protestors were near his funeral chanting offensive things, saying 'thank god for dead soldiers' and 'god hates the army.' Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come together and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed, then what's the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when you're going to end up doing it too? And you're going to do it without a care in the world, not thinking about who you're hurting. Everyone has an opinion and wants to defend it, but people are different and some will always see it different than what you see. So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside, don't watch it, don't read it, don't try to hear about it from a friend or stranger; leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone, and then you wouldn't have even known about it. Live life and don't worry about the negative; let's focus on the positive of what you see and move forward.
992	3969	2	3	'Can I read this?' Parents around the world have asked this or been asked this question. Parents have their own right to read what they want, but are the children allowed to? There are books that children or young adults should read and should not read. This judgment can vary, for it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut, and violence in books that children should not read. In high school there are some books like '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' that have cursing in them. For high schoolers of sixteen or older it will be alright to read. High schoolers understand and have heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a fifth grader, they would not understand the full potential it holds for learning from it. Children in that age range will not understand that the man is handicapped, and then the children would not understand the killing the handicapped man had done or why his friend killed him after it. Would a parent let a ten-year-old read a smut novel? This depends on the way the parent was raised and how they feel it will affect the child's development. An @PERSON1 book would not be appropriate for a child of that age, for the child does not, and will not, understand the book itself. The book is more than just that one part of smut; there is a gothic and romantic style of writing to @PERSON1 books. A child of ten years old would not have developed the mature way of thinking required for the book. Violence! 'Violence is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This phrase is said but it's not always followed. Young adults play video games and read books in school related to violence. '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is a book about a colored teenager going to a white school. This is a book giving kids a chance to see how things were. A child in elementary school would think it's funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will see it as a game and do not have enough background or maturity to understand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a TV show with a hit or a punch, the child will think it is okay to do it. Overall, there will be violence, cursing, and smut novels out there. The thing is, it depends on the parents and the maturity level of the person or child. There is a wrong and right way to do it, but for parents, it is not right to let someone underage read a book filled with curses, violence, or smut without proper guidance and context.
993	3970	2	3	Almost everyone has a movie they would like to see, or a book they would like to read. What happens if they take a trip to the library and check the catalog, only to find out it had been removed from the system because of bad language or mild themes? I believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read. Some parents don't allow much offensive material at all while others don't mind it. Also, the books and movies for adults are different than children's books and movies. It would not be fair to remove offensive books, music, or magazines from the shelf because different people like different content. Today, we live in a world of violence and it is going to be hard to avoid violence and offensive material. For some people, they want to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or they like it. First of all, different people consider the same content differently, and the titles being removed might not be judged fairly. The people who want to see the latest movies that just came out are usually going to see some type of violence. With more advanced computers and technology, there can be more special effects and more violence added to movies easier. In books, they might have old language that isn't up to the standards of today. For example, in the 1920s and 1930s, when the word 'gay' used to mean happy, it is a whole different word now and it is in a lot of old books and songs. Some people might find that offensive and some might not. Adult content is very different than children's content. Adults have movies and music based on real life situations and stories while most children's content is based on the alphabet and sing-alongs. There are also the more grown-up kid movies like @ORGANIZATION1's '@CAPS1.' That one is based in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 training to be a hero. During his fights, he kills the creatures that he fights. So if the libraries started censoring materials, then a classic @ORGANIZATION1 movie would be considered violent. The adult movies are worse in every way; they involve cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content. I'm not going into any further detail about adult movies. Being an adult, one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and be the judge of what they are going to let their children watch. Different people like different content and it is only fair for them to be the one to decide what they watch and consider violent. An example: one person might grow up around a farm and be used to seeing animals killed, while one who grew up in a neighborhood has never seen an animal killed. When they both see a movie or read a book with an animal killed, it will have hardly an effect on the one from the farm compared to the likely painful effect on the one from a neighborhood. Think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book. A soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a CEO of a company. As stated before, different people prefer different types of content. All in all, I don't think there should be any censorship on library content. It should be up to the parents to make the choice of what they are going to let their children watch or read. Adults can also be the judge of what they let themselves watch. Lastly, again, different people like different content and it's not fair for one to choose what another can or can't watch, as personal freedom and responsibility should prevail.
994	3971	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies, or magazines on the bookshelves are offensive, they should still be left there. They are a part of our history and the history we're creating. If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today; you could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer. Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business by driving away patrons who seek diverse materials. From what I've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already, especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored. A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them and learned from their narratives. Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to access these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them, as they serve as a vital repository for all ideas and expressions, allowing individuals to make their own informed choices.
995	3972	2	3	Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies, and magazines. These books, movies, and magazines might come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take those offensive books off the shelf? If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young children need books to help their imagination grow and to learn about the world around them. If there were not any more books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow in the same way. Movies are just like books, but for young children, it is easier to visualize a movie rather than a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another one, but it should not be removed from the shelf for everyone else. One book or movie might seem offensive to you, but it might not to another person who finds value or enjoyment in it. A world without books would mean no imagination and no adventures; it would be a boring world indeed. I would rather have a few offensive books than none at all, because that way I can learn and see characters' adventures through my own eyes, developing my own understanding and critical thinking skills about the content I choose to engage with.
996	3973	2	3	Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you? If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying i can't learn with this black girl in class with me? Or if two people with different religions yould say he or she offends me because we dont believe in the same god. The principle remains the same in all these scenarios. Just because someone is offended by a book or wrighting does not mean it should by removed form the shelf. In fact if they dont like it they dont have to read or even look at it. That is one freedom we have in america is to read anything we would like to. For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom and the freedom of others who may wish to access that material. It sets a dangerous precedent where any individual's personal discomfort could dictate what is available for everyone. In conclusion it is not okay for anything to be takin off of a public shelf no matter who in offends. It is a right we have as american's to read or wright anything we would like to, And removing offencive meteral would be taking away our freedom and undermining the very foundation of a free society.
997	3974	2	3	I do not think that censoship has a ightful place in our librares. I know that libraries were created to be information hubs for the public, offering a wide range of perspectives and ideas. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they could be seen as offensive to a minority of people. This would diminish the library's role as a comprehensive resource. A library's collection should reflect diverse viewpoints, not just those that are universally agreeable. Removing materials based on individual complaints would ultimately impoverish the intellectual environment and limit public access to knowledge. Therefore, censorship contradicts the fundamental purpose of a library, which is to serve as a repository of information for all citizens, regardless of content.
998	3975	2	3	I do believe that libraries should censor certain materials. Some things like music and magazines have bad language and racey pictures in them. Some parents might not want there kids to be exposed to this. Some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and wants them to be safer. The easiest way to prevent children from listening to innappropiate music or looking at offensive books is to take them off the shelves. Some children go to the library without adult supervision and have freedom to check out whatever book they want. The child could easily pick out an innopropiate book and read it because there is no parent there to guide them. There is nobody to tell them what is wrong and right so some kids might not know. Thats why some books and music should be removed. If you do not remove innappropiate books and music from the shelves you would have to have an attendent. The attendent would have to walk and around and check out what each individual kid is doing. It would be a lot of busy work and the libriarians are aready busy enough. Nobody really wants to do that so the simplier solution is to just remove the books and music from the shelves. Another opition if you do want to keep the music and books on the shelves is to have an age limit on the books and music to check them out. If this were done it would still lead to problems like kids reading the books at the library but never checking hem out. This is an easy way to get around the system. A child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them, so they could read it later. This is another example of how easy it would be to get around that system. Therefore, the easiest way to aviod problems with books and music is to remove them from the shelves. If this were done it is harder for the children to get the innopropriate books and music. If somebody needed to check out an innappropiate book for any reason, they could go someplace else. This is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe from content deemed harmful.
999	3976	2	3	Censorship? Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it? Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries. Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. Everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it. I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it . If it has a good message to send to you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there. If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you about the importance of free access to information.
1000	3977	2	3	I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship. A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the classic books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it. Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves. Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it. Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them. You can't please everyone, so just let us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin and trust individuals to choose for themselves.
1001	3978	2	3	In the words of the author, Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' There are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another. If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted for by everyone, they are mistaken. Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they will not always be pleased with the outcome. Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncensored material can be found on every shelf. As in my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language. Shakespeare's play 'Othello' describes him in very crude ways. Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved. Othello was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis. Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate. Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom. Shakespeare also discusses a 'strumpet' in 'Othello'. Once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different. Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products. Magazines are a threshold of adult matters. Once a teenager or child views all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life. They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine. Who wouldn't want to be like a model? When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like goddesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards. After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications. A whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful. In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide. Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind. Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men. Are you going to control your life or let the media?
1002	3979	2	3	Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some books, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is too much racial slurs, profanity, and inappropriate situations. How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain. It recently got banned from schools all over the country. People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools, it is up to the kids not to read them. Inappropriate situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scenes in the books. Do you say to blame them? I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for America's youth.
1003	3980	2	3	People out there have the right to decide whether or not their child's books have censorship in it. Some parents don't want their child to read books like that till they get older. Kids in grade school don't know the book they are getting has profanity in it. I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yeah some parents don't care what their child reads. Think about the ones that do. Not every one has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me I would not put books with censorship in them in my child's school. Then again the high school students are old enough to look through the books and decide if they want to get that book or not. Yeah some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own decisions. Some students may not realize what book they grabbed until they start reading but that's when they turn around and exchange it. I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books. This is why I think books and magazines etc. with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools. If you agree YOU can do something about it. Talk to your child's school.
1004	3981	2	3	Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contain offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that don't consider them to be offensive. What is offensive to one person, may not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from a song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday. These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certain magazine may not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likely be nothing left. Removing them could cause chaos to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certain materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesn't offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge. Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in a lot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain a lot of physical and sexual content along with a decent amount of foul language. An older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more because they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing a lot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest. Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor may not offend me. Chances are that there will always be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They may still be offended on the inside but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing.
1005	3982	2	3	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in libraries or some may not think it's so important. Books are important parts of peoples lives, learning, etc, they are also read for many different reasons but some of the topics books are written about may not be right or could be inappropriate or possibly against all of someones beliefs or religion. I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of libraries just some things shouldn't be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library maybe materials that are inappropriate for children or people may find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials. Another reason why censorship may not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that may be offensive or inappropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on television or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. Television has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that a television show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of todays young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. Todays children and young people should be taught of whats wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unnecessary at the time when they mature they hopefully will see why they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on television and not get involved with these activities. Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the inappropriate and harmful things in todays culture. Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with whats right. In conclusion censorship is not necessary, it could be in the future but if everyone is lead to what is right they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.
1006	3983	2	3	You Are @CAPS1 You @CAPS2? Censorship is a touchy subject in our society today. People ask, '@CAPS3 much should be censored?' or even 'Should @CAPS9 be censored at all?' @CAPS4 opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are reading, listening to, or watching materials. Television networks and reading companies, including publishers and libraries, can't possibly take the place of a parent. I believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care @CAPS1 the child is reading, the distrubuters of the materials can't be punished for that lack of involvement.  In @CAPS4 experience, @CAPS4 mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age. She is always interested in @CAPS1 I am reading. Occasionally, she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to @CAPS2. @CAPS4 mother has also censored @CAPS4 music by glancing through @CAPS4 music player and every so often, playing a song or two. @CAPS9 discourages me from listening to anything that @CAPS4 mother wouldn't approve of. I have also experienced censorship in @CAPS4 local library. The library is divided into sections, begining with the children's books. These books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material. @CAPS9 section leads to young adult, then eventually the adult books. The music is also similarly divided into these catagories. I believe @CAPS9 is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to for their own well-being.  Through reading the book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' by @PERSON1, I have observed that parents need to have some involvement in @CAPS1 their children are reading, listening to, and watching. In @CAPS9 book, @PERSON2's parents simply left him alone while he was in his room. They let him listen to his own music, and watch @CAPS1 he wanted. @CAPS9 led him to listening to a @CAPS7 metal band called '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.' @CAPS9 band influenced him to commit a homocide in his school, killing ten students. @CAPS9 is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all. Violence can have a large impact in young kids; therefore, they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature enough to process it properly.  Through @CAPS4 reading, I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population. The novel '@CAPS10 @NUM1' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme. Reading is banned in their society, except for comic books and sex magazines. @CAPS9 shows that without a right to @CAPS2, society is reduced to very simple, uneducated creatures. Censoring an entire people's reading is impractical and damaging to intellectual growth. @CAPS4 opinion is that once a person is an adult, they have the common sense and maturity to @CAPS2 whatever they choose without government interference.  Censorship is difficult to take a stand on because ther are so many posatives and negatives to consider. @CAPS4 position on @CAPS9 vital subject is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading, not the government or the reading companies. Once a person is an adult, their right is to choose whatever they like to @CAPS2. Reading is a magical thing that should not be held back from adults who are prepared to experience it to its fullest. As long as society keeps a balance between the outcome of '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' in which censorship was not practiced, and '@CAPS10 @NUM1' in which it was enforced to the fullest, I believe that we have reached an appropriate balance. Censorship is healthy for children, but restricting in adults.
1007	3984	2	3	Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certian types of book away from people. How does that really help? Even if you remove certian book or music from a library doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad in the grand scheme of things. I think it is better for some one to read about somthing the have it happen to them and then experince it. Like Katherine Paterson said if we let people get rid of book of music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to what will we have left. Nothing! Through people think censorring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad side to have much of a good effect overall.  When people try to censor things they normally just take things off of shelfs and get rid of them. But, in today world of technology that doesn't stop people from obtaining there goal. We have the internet that lets people upload book and music to share with others. So yeah, you many not be able to get a book at the library but you can almost always find it online. In result trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really is doing anything to limit access.  How do you determine what should be censored? People all have a different idea of what is ok for the public and what is not. Some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them. Then you loss business and make poeple mad at the same time. In some way isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt anyone directly. When things like that happen in a book they normally don't just stop there. They show the results or how the situation was handled. Which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situatuions later on it there life. Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't be.  Katherrine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is unmoral nothing will be left. Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad or objectionable. Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way and want it to remain. No books would be left if we censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book ever written.  Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth. It is not stoping people from obtaining the information another way. There is no way to decide what shuld be censored that everyone will agree on. And, censoring somethings will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing on the shelves. In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end for society as a whole.
1008	3985	2	3	Dear Newspaper staff, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1 I @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I am in the @NUM1 grade. The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc. They are exposed to too much too soon.  In @CAPS7 books, magazines, movies, have things in it that shouldnt be in there for young people. When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it and it can influence their behavior negatively. When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on, which is another source of bad influence. If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music, the virus on the computer and the books being riped up. But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things that are not good for them.  If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves, that would solve a lot of problems. That would be so wonderful for everyone, especially for parents and teachers. If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes with behavior and attitudes. When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape and the environment will be safer for kids. This is why I think removing offensive materials is the right thing to do for our community.
1009	3986	2	3	What is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world? There are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby. Books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers. The latest gossip can be found in many magazines. Music is sometimes said to help people cope with life problems. Movies can open up peoples' imaginations and make them feel emotions for a theme of no importance. All these things make up peoples lives and provide enjoyment. Without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time? Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off shelves. They're huge factors that make up the society and make life what it is, interesting and diverse.  Books and magazines are two fun things people love to read. Fiction or nonfiction? No matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people and expand their horizons. Reading is a hobby that's been around since the beginning of times. There are many different selections in reading, for example, adventure, mystery, comedy, or love stories. People will always read no matter what, as it is a fundamental human activity. Most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome, but those are the stories that draw people in and make them think. Magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store. People love to read gossip, and learn about the latest trends. Magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people, a brief escape from daily life. When reading a juicy title, most people can't help themselves but to pick up the magazine and learn what's going on in someone else's life.  Music is used for so many different things in our daily lives. It's often listened to when driving down the road or relaxing at home. Many people fall asleep to soothing instruments that make a beautiful melody. Lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge or difficult time. There is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples' moods instantly. On most @DATE1 nights, it is always seen that movie theatre's are very crowded with people seeking entertainment. Movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along, becoming immersed in another world. When watching a movie with a sad ending, most people cry, showing its emotional power. Although not always real, it touches people on an emotional level and helps them understand different perspectives. Movies can bring things to life in a way that nothing else can.  Life is what it is from contributing factors that shape our experiences. All people think differently and like unsimilar things, which is what makes humanity interesting. Books, magazines, music, and movies all relate to peoples' likes and dislikes, forming part of their identity. Taking things off the shelves because they are offensivc or don't alway make people feel good, won't make our world any better of a place. If anything it will take away happiness in the world and limit our understanding. These things make people feel different in ways that can't be described with words alone. Most often things that are offensive is the truth that needs to be confronted. Why hide things that are real and part of the human experience? What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't do something just because it could offend a couple people out of millions? All these things are comfort for some people and should be available to them.  Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and everyday life what it is, full of variety and creativity. They are simple things in life, but once gone they are a huge gap missing from our culture. Things are fun and creative because of books, magazines, music, and movies that inspire us. In my own experience books make me interested in subjects I never knew about, magazines fufill my want for reading about celebrities, music makes me feel happy when I am sad, and movies make me feel like I can feel the same emotions as the characters do.They should not be taken off shelves just because they are offensive, they are part of life and help us grow as individuals.
1010	3987	2	3	In this essay I am going to write about the books about the librabries. Also if they are books that can be offensive and that it can or not be removed by the libraries.I think that the libraries have the right to have any materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more on the shelves. Well in my opinion I think that they should not remove any books because people @MONTH1 think that it can be offensive but other people @MONTH1 be into those books and find them valuable. So no I don't think they should remove any because some people have different opinions on different books and what they find enjoyable or offensive.  When I go to libraries they are books that I can enjoy reading or not like but that is just my opinion and personal taste. Some people might like the book that I did not liked or hate but I think that the books should not be removed from the shelves because some people might enjoy it and some won't, and that is okay. I think they should not remove books because the books are for people that are interseted on the books that they want to read or learn about the stuff about the past or just fiction books for entertainment. Everyone should have the choice to pick what they want.  I just talked about the essay I just wrote I talked about the books about the libraries, and how some books can be offensive to other people that are trying to pick books, and also if
1011	3988	2	3	Books are an extremely important part of literature and culture. Many different people have different views of different kinds of books. Some people enjoy books, and some people don't. Some people are fast readers, and some people aren't. Reading is an individual task. Your reading abilities, interests, and preferences are different from everyone else's. The main idea here is preferences. You may enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else might find offensive. But just because someone else doesn't enjoy it, does that mean that you shouldn't be able to enjoy it for yourself? Just because it is in the library, doesn't mean you have to check it out. Just because it is the new release in the book store and everyone loves it, doesn't mean YOU have to buy it. Other people can avoid the topics that they don't like. For example, if the local library took out all of the books that had anything to do with drugs and alcohol, because they found them offensive, the fact that they took the books out, could be offensive to the other people who enjoyed them. Also, some things could be offensive to some people that could be critical to research for others. Then, some people might not have the resources available that they need for their studies or personal growth. If it is music, movies, or magazines, then it should be dealt with the same way. People have a choice of what they want to buy and rent. If a certain artist or actor is offensive to them, they should find something else and leave that CD or movie for someone else to enjoy. They shouldn't complain about it. How would they feel if someone found their favorite band's music offensive and then no one could rent it from the library or buy it anywhere? Then, people would understand that everyone is different in their own way and not everyone will enjoy what they do. I think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that, everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels. Every book, movie, song, magazine, and any other thing, should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too.
1012	3989	2	3	People of the world will always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves. If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued. Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have. Books about anatomy are an exception but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to change in that facility. Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it. Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future generations. If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it. What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are. People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad that says Budweiser Beer, or All New Cigarettes, these are found in a lot of magazines like Sports Illustrated and sometimes Cosmopolitan. These ads are totally uncalled for in publications that might be viewed by minors. If people looked into this more, than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much. These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians. These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive. So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences for the community you serve.
1013	3990	2	3	Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view? For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated R. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it should be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages. Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a CD has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a CD can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to. Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, I don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you. With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech and the freedom to access diverse ideas.
1014	3991	2	3	Magazines and Books. I am writing an essay on should we take books, magazines, or movies off the shelves if they have bad language or have violent roles in it. First thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. For me personally like books that have violence and graphic language in them because that just makes the book so much more interesting. And when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to. And television broadcasters need to watch what they put on the air because some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch. The second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books. I don't think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violence or hearing words that are graphic. But its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it. Because it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that. And its also up to the childrens parents what kind of music they listen to. Nowadays there is more curse words in the music than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazines. Magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to pictures. Me myself don't really look at magazines because they don't really interest me I would rather sit down and watch what ever it is on TV. Then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in american more censored for kids. I think the libraries should have different rooms that have different types of book in them. Because if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading. They should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphic pictures or that just are not suitable for children. That is why I think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands. Kids don't need to know bad language at their age because that is a bad habit for a kid to learn then they will go to school saying them. And reading books that talk about beating somebody up or murder might get it in a little kids head that that is ok. And that is not ok with me or with most responsible adults.
1015	3992	2	3	Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be censored? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be censored. My first supporting reason of why books and music should be censored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncensored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer pressure. The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music offends people by their race, religion, or their appearance. You find most of the criticism from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to do drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisement about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended. My final reasoning for books and music being censored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, certain rap artists and heavy metal bands tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all metal and rap artists are bad. If songs and books were censored there wouldn't be a stereo type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material. Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are censored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be censored for the betterment of our society.
1016	3993	2	3	I do not think they should be removed at all. They show a person's opinion on something, which is a fundamental part of individual expression. We can't just disregard it because we don't like what it's saying; that is a form of intellectual intolerance. Thats like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how you look. Or just anyone that we don't like how they look, which is clearly discriminatory and unjust. I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship or suppression of their voice. I may not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance to be heard like anyone else would. You should restrict access according to age and content appropriateness so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be exposed to at a young age. I could get a book removed because it offends me personally. Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me, and that would set a dangerous precedent. People are offended by little things and should just except the fact that other people have different opinions and perspectives. It's just like judging a person for their race, which is universally condemned. They have different morales and values and you can't just change that in a person or force them to conform. Like if you don't like this article just don't read it; it is a simple matter of personal choice. Don't say other people can't read it because of your own personal views and sensitivities. I don't think there should be censorship in a society that values free thought and open dialogue.
1017	3994	2	3	There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while other believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books of their own volition. No one is forcing them to read them; the choice is entirely personal. I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion and subjective interpretation. I feel that people have different perspectives and personal thresholds on what they find appropriate or inappropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. Some politicians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter or even as legitimate satire. Another example would be a book on religious purposes. For instance, a book on an unfamiliar religion. Some followers might take it as offensive if the information paints them as being a certain stereotype, but others may see it as educational learning about different cultures and beliefs. I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will and personal autonomy. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song; that would be an infringement on their liberties. It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us and aligns with our interests. I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who might be coming to rent the book that day for their own purposes. Its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their personal take is on the matter presented. I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes, which are central to a library's mission. I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive or without merit. I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information from a wide array of sources. Some of the material found might be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong' or entirely without value. I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational and historically significant books would not be available today for study. The library is a place where our free will comes into play and we exercise our right to choose. I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries for that reason alone. These books all contain information that could be veiwed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decifer for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable for their own consumption. I believe that no one should decide for us what we can or cannot access.
1018	3995	2	3	Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you exercise that power? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive or controversial to some. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, which is a drastic measure, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive while retaining the core message? First, no one should have the right to remove materials they find offensive from a public space like a library. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to entertain ourselves, as almost any material could offend someone. Also it would start a big fight because a lot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people don't find offensive, a big riot will start over the control of information. Secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? Maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if they could make it less vulgar or more nuanced. Same with music, movies, and magazines; there are often ways to adjust content without resorting to outright bans. So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not, and that right must be protected. I think if I came across something that offended me I wouldn't do anything about it beyond choosing not to engage with it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves; that is a fundamental freedom. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do, and we must coexist with differing viewpoints.
1019	3996	2	3	Empty Rhetoric: Why is it wrong to censor? In the world there are today there is about eight billion people. All these people make up different groups with different moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and out looks on the world, creating a vast tapestry of human experience. With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is universally defined as wrong and right, as no single standard exists. The three subject that will be discussed in this article will be censorship, expression, and society, and how they intersect. To be censored puts a label on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone, effectively silencing a perspective. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel by those in authority. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, whether it would be of sex, drugs, or politics, which are often contentious topics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, television, or other forms of media that reach the public. the reasons that something is censored changes from place to place based on local norms and power structures. Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a general area could be disastrous in the eyes of some who fear dissent. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next da Vinci, Socrates, or any other great thinker of the world whose ideas changed history. Censoring these people can and would be horrible for the progress of knowledge and art. The idea that just because someone has a different out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world; they may simply see things differently. True their work could cause a problem for established ideas, but their idea should not be shunned by the world without consideration. The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age, with guidance where necessary. Society possess a big problem when it comes to agreeing on standards. Society or how one should act in public is different all over the world, reflecting diverse cultures. So therefore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else, showing the relativity of such judgments. This also mean what is wrong or right is different to everyone on earth, making a single standard impossible. The society will have great effect on what is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society and its institutions. if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned, suppressing minority views. If this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything, leading to stagnation. So ultimately, why is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others, as it privileges certain viewpoints over others. If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that persons views, creating a cycle of suppression. So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for their ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct, as it undermines mutual respect. Everything should be aloud to exist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter, allowing for a free marketplace of ideas. In conclusion censorship, expression, and society will always have views but none of these view should ever be hidden from anything or anyone if we are to remain a free people.
1020	3997	2	3	If content in a library is considered offensive, it should still remain on the shelf regardless of personal objections. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many patrons, but a select few will still value the media for what it is and the perspective it offers. Taking one kids cake because it has too much frosting would anger most kids (and adults), as it is an unfair deprivation based on a subjective preference. If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material it should remain organized with the rest of its kind, not exiled in the furthest corner or removed entirely. When one checks out such media they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropriate and/or offensive content, acknowledging their informed consent. I personally find certain controversial poems or in the context of a song, certain intense themes fascinating from an artistic standpoint. Every time I look up these poems I have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with its violent or hateful content before proceeding. Although, I do agree it should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read (or listen to) without their consent and a clear warning. I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice for managing access. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to when a simple solution of choice and consent is available.
1021	3998	2	3	Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose. These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes. Some things did happen, such as the Holocaust, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it. Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize something big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the story line is phenomenal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time. As for books in libraries, we should make a separate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wander across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a special sticker on the book to warn parents as well. In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just maybe moved to a different location. Let the people read what they want to read.
1022	3999	2	3	As far as opinions go, everyone has one. Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an argument for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in one's opinion should not be omitted. At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed. Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of eighteen, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding. Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the child's curiosity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and might be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplest solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated. Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book because they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read. To agree to removing information from the library is absolutely purposeless, and might be an inconvenience for someone whom might have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be.
1023	4000	2	3	Libraries have so many books, and books that talk about everything so what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves. If people want to read something that is too bad I say let them; what is so wrong with reading? Everyone needs to read, maybe that's the only books some people like to read. So by taking them books off isn't helping anything. I think some of the bad books taken off the shelves are good just have bad things in them; any book is a good book. If something is so bad it needs off the shelves there has to be a reason for it, the way I see it is that there has to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad and you know what that is funny. People get mad at books that they don't want their kids to read, or they're mad because they didn't come up with that idea. If you don't want your kids to read it tell them not to; let the older people that don't care have a good time reading. Most people like to read about messed up things. Music and Movies are a different story. Bad movies shouldn't be put out for everyone to see; movies aren't the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not know what half of the bad stuff means. But movies show you how bad things are shown. Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make them look cool. But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick and if you have kids you are a boss to them; you can tell them not to get anything bad.
1024	4001	2	3	In all libraries you are offered a choice on which book you would like to choose. So if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want censorship then you can. The libraries should not take away books because of the content, in my honest opinion it should be the readers choice and not someone else's. When choosing a book you have to think, do I really want to read this? Each book gives you a little description on the back of the book giving you a little inside so you can tell if you would like to read the book or not. I do believe if it has suggested content that you should not let little kids read them but at a high school level we pretty much are able to make choices for ourselves. Music should not be censored because if a song says something that you don't want to hear like cussing or suggestive content then just turn the station. You don't have to sit and listen to the song, you can change it with a click or push of a button. Songs that are on the radio are for enjoyment and entertainment so you made the choice to go to that station and listen to the music that is on it; you made the choice and nobody can make it for you. With movies they have a description on the back that tells what is going to be in the movie and what it's rated; if you don't want to watch a movie with bad language or bad content you should not have chose the movie in the first place; it is clear as day on the case what will be in it. On movie cases it even gives you pictures of certain scenes and if they seem a little suggestive then put it back and select a different movie. Magazines are meant to tell the truth and sometimes the truth is hard. Magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself. If you are really bothered by certain language thumb through the magazine and see if it is appropriate or not for you. Libraries should not have to get rid of books just because of some content; a person who walks through those doors should be aware of what is in the library and what exactly they will find. In libraries they have categories in which certain topics are under; by going towards a selection it is saying that you understand what type of book it will be.
1025	4002	2	3	Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like; you might think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else might like, and want to read. Would it be fair to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else does not like, and thinks that it offends them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said? I don't think that things like that should be taken off a shelf for something like that, because there could be a person in school that needs something like that; it is not right for a child to be looking at, but what if there is a kid in high school or college that needs a book to do a project over that type of things? But also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a library, and their children see something that they do not want them to see. There are very many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is too little to see or hear what their parents do not want them to. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a certain age to be able to go look or listen to them. Libraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds of books you should be mature for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it because you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it.
1026	4003	2	3	First, libraries are a good source of information, yet they can have both pros and cons regarding their content. Some information should be accessible only to adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this? Next, you can find information about everyday life through various media. Through magazines, movies, music, and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses and says inappropriate things. There have been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as 'Cosmopolitan'. All these materials have to stay out of libraries or be put in a special section where children can't reach them. Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library space should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library; they could remove the music entirely. Also, at the same time, while children shouldn't get their hands on certain books, they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventually. The library committee should have a contest in which people of any age from the community could write an essay telling their opinion on this matter. Finally, I've come up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should discard these books because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be eighteen or older to enter and show an identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that specific department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, and children will not be able to proceed into this section. In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information, so they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines, and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of a certain age, and in that way, they won't need censorship.
1027	4004	2	3	I feel that you have the right to choose to remove certain books, movies, music, and magazines, but only if they are not appropriate for some people and children. Some people like them, others do not; it all depends on who you are. If I go to a library and the books I want are on the restricted list, the library should have a small fee somewhere around one to five dollars depending on the type of book. For instance, if I wanted the movie 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and it was restricted, I would pay something like a Redbox rental fee. This system would allow access while maintaining control. That is what I think about restricting certain items from the library, as it balances community standards with individual access. -@PERSON1.
1028	4005	2	3	People that walk the surface of our planet sometimes feel the need to have something banned or at least get some dirt on it to make people think less of it. It is just the way our world works when it comes to something you just can't stand, but why even bother, just what exactly are they going to get out of it? If someone took the time to create it then we all deserve the right to view it. I do not agree on censorship in our world. Local libraries are a very nice place to go for books, movies, and information. How is this to be such a good resource for people once everything is gone, especially considering some of the world's greatest books ever written are the ones that are targeted by censorship. I believe Katherine Paterson has a very valuable point in saying, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' because it is true. People don't stop at just one; once something is gone they will continue hunting for things that they just hate, which will lead to people suffering from not being able to enjoy the things they want. When I was younger, I remember going to the library all the time for Disney movies and books. I personally got to actually see a book be removed because of censorship, and although I did not fully understand, I felt that if I read it, I would get grounded. Which is also not good for kids because they shouldn't be scared to read something. We live in a place with the freedom of speech, but yet that right seems to be fading away. There's still more ways to see censorship and how it affects the libraries though, such as actually reading about some of the cases that have tried to ban books. Although most attempts fail to result in a ban right now, the world is very unpredictable. In school there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned. Which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year. So that doesn't make sense on why to take them off the shelves. Reading is what keeps us informed, on the past and even the future. 'Then we have no books left'—if this is what people wish for then keep at it, but if there is some sort of decency in you, I would imagine when it comes to making an easy choice like this, you too would choose the right one, saying no to censorship. Reading is what keeps us strong, entertained, and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it, unless books are gone.
1029	4006	2	3	Many individuals visit different libraries all over the world every day. Some go for books, some for magazines, some for movies. Everyone has different taste, so a library is where they go because they have absolutely everything. Libraries have all kinds of amazing different books. It is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research. There should be no limits on what books, movies, magazines, etc., are on the shelf. Everyone has different beliefs and feelings on what they would like to read or see. If libraries starting limiting their options, I don't think that they would have as much business and people would not read as much. Which means that an individual's literacy could go down. Reading helps everyone in this world, by learning new vocabulary and just exercising their own mind. By taking away someone's interest, they won't read as much, or feel as free. Just because someone doesn't like something, does not mean the next person won't. If a book or movie, etc., is offensive to someone, they can just simply not read it or watch it. No one has the right to take over someone's mind regarding what they are interested in. However, limiting the age groups for certain items would not be a horrible idea. Books that may be offensive or not appropriate for a young child should not be allowed to be seen or checked out by a young child, but that does not mean take it away from others who are mature enough to handle the content.
1030	4007	2	3	Books nowadays have action, romances, and other exciting elements. So that's why the books that are not moving off the shelf is because they don't have what other books have. So they just sit there, while most of the other books that are getting off the shelf are the happy stories, the fantasy side, the mysteries, and all of the vampire books. It's because they have action, love, and engaging plots. The books that are on and off the shelf are maybe really good books. Some books don't ever leave the shelf; it's probably because they are not really that great. The reason for it is because the books that remain on the shelf are boring, or are old school books; they really don't have what the reader is looking for. However, the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies, like the fantasy side. That book has gotten sold faster than the movies. The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because the books from the movies, like the fantasy side, provide more information on the story. I heard that that book is nothing like the movie; the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more detail on the plot. So therefore, people really like books that come from a movie. There are more reasons why people like books nowadays. You don't have to go to a book store anymore; the books are now on your iPhone, iPod, iTouch, iPad, and a Nook, etc. So now you don't have to go to a book store anymore. You can get it on your iPhone and other devices; people are really happy that they don't have to get up in the morning or whenever they get their books. They can however now just get them on the go. So that is why physical books are now on the shelves for good, because you can get digital versions on the go. But I believe that people who like the feel of a physical book should also try getting an iPhone or Nook, something that saves you time while you are on your way to work or school.
1031	4008	2	3	First, I do not think the libraries should take all of those items off the shelves because some of those things people need to help them with their work. For instance, when some people need music to think clearly and concentrate, they rely on the library's collection. Similarly, maybe some people need magazines for research or for a mental break during their studies. These resources serve important functions for various patrons. Therefore, I do not think the libraries should take the items off the shelves as they provide essential support.
1032	4009	2	3	The short assignment is about my experience watching the movie anthology horror film with a friend. I admit I was scared out of my mind at first, then I got over it after a while. Then after a few times of watching similar films, you get used to the suspense and the frightening scenes, and I did eventually become accustomed to them. That's it for this assignment, which describes my personal reaction to the horror genre.
1033	4010	2	3	The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker. The library holds books of past and current writers, preserving a wide range of intellectual work. It also holds information on past and current events, serving as a repository for societal memory. Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate in many communities. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles, as this practice undermines the library's fundamental purpose. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history. One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information for future generations. Periods like the holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jewish people by Nazi Germany, would eventually die with the generations that knew about it, leading to historical amnesia. The holocaust was an event that became known worldwide during the Second World War, which was a major historical event that shaped the modern world. The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship, erasing a significant and painful chapter. The slave trade is a major part in American history that helped shape the country it is today, and understanding it is crucial. Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance to our collective identity. If we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history that inform our present. Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn from past mistakes and triumphs. Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed if we value a complete and honest historical record. Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books. One reason is because authors wrote their books how they intended them to be read, and altering them distorts their artistic vision. An example is Mark Twain. The author of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Both books use the word nigger to convey the tone and setting of the era they depict. Another example is the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee. Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an author's writing style, which is integral to the work. The author writes a book how they want it to be read, making deliberate choices about language. Therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about to create authenticity. Mark Twain didn't use nigger because he was racist, he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked then. Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books and compromise authorial intent. Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles. One reason is because newspapers were the primary way to send out information to the public before digital media. It brought people's attention to recent happenings in their communities and the world. It informed people of what was going on, fostering an informed citizenry. Getting rid of that is just another loss of information that could be vital for research. Newspapers were key players in getting out information about the Vietnam War, the Second World War, the assassination of President Kennedy and the Civil Rights Movement. Another reason to keep from censoring newspapers in libraries is because of their importance today as historical documents. They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events, providing context for current affairs. An example is the death of Osama bin Laden and how he caused the deaths of many Americans on September eleventh. Articles about views on the death penalty also show the diversity of public opinion. Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles that are part of the public record. The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker, a sanctuary for learning. There, they can read about past and current events without filtration. They can also read classics by great authors in their original form. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles, as access to unfiltered information is a cornerstone of a free society.
1034	4011	2	3	Dear Editor, Around the world there are people who censor what their people read and write, these works are oftenly produced by communist and socialist governments that control information. Here in America we have the right to say, read, and write what we want, about anybody or anything, as protected by our Constitution. Censorship does exist in the United States, and it is in the form of opinion that it exists, often through public pressure or political correctness. I have read articles in the paper about how text books have covered up the truth, due to what is politically correct and avoids controversy. I have heard of libraries taking down books that have a very strong political opinion, often these are books written by conservatives that challenge mainstream views. I have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming, probable presidential nominees, which are highly partisan. Being a conservative myself, I do not believe that these books should not be in book stores, libraries, or other public venues, as that would be suppression. I believe this because in America we have freedom of press and, for these books not to reach the public is against that right and, the free-flow of ideas which is essential. You may ask why I believe this? I believe this because I too want others to hear and read about my ideas, on how to obtain life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which is a fundamental American ideal. Now that is why all books should be in our libraries, to ensure a marketplace of ideas. I agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored, so little children will not get a hold of inappropriate material, which is a reasonable compromise. I would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts to stimulate discussion. We the American people are a republic, and we for over two hundred years have encouraged the free-flow of ideas, which has made us strong. Why stop now? Thank you for considering my perspective.
1035	4012	2	3	My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways to those who are concerned about community standards. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person, indicating a broader community concern. If they are not that big of a problem and only bother a few, they shouldn't be removed, as libraries must serve a diverse public. People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there that conflict with their values. Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, such as young children, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think, in a negative way. A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying, as these themes can be harmful. From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously and internalize the messages. Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos, as collections can be large and oversight difficult. I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it, which shows a inconsistency. In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them, involving the community in the process. I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries, to maintain a safe and appropriate environment. Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials to protect their children, which is a natural parental instinct.
1036	4013	2	3	I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inappropriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not. Certain material such as rated R movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that. People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library. Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library. I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far too young to know about. The youth of our community is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it. Therefore, implementing sensible censorship is a necessary measure to protect our children and maintain a family-friendly environment in our public libraries.
1037	4014	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote from the author, Katherine Paterson, means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle. First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inappropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show an I.D. so that kids and children don't accidentally slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better. Secondly, if an individual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough complaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see. Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inappropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas. Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inappropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inappropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it, and this balanced approach protects children while preserving access for adults.
1038	4015	2	3	Books on shelves are there for a reason. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote. The quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children. Libraries have non-fiction and fiction books as well as magazines, music and movies. I myself like to learn a little bit of everything but of course there is things that I don't like learning when I am too young. I like discovering things on my own. There is times where I do like discovering new things because I don't know when life ends. In other words I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world. Magazines also just have a lot of trouble and sometimes, yes it's life but also its just dramatic things about people. A library is a good place to learn lots of things. You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people, music, etc. Honestly, the only thing I go there for, is to read and to check out books, but from books I have learned a lot. There is some material that shouldn't be read and discovered when you're too young. There's material that is too strong for some children and they should learn it as they grow, not all in a bunch. Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have warning signs for their age. There is times where it is good to learn about life but you have to be careful because it might be too strong. There is books that teach you a lot. I have learned a lot from old books to new books. I don't think that the books should be removed, yes they might be strong, but it is our own choice to read it or not. There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason and it's not to make fun of people. Magazines are also sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about what's going on around the world. There is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people. I don't think its important to be showing other people's personal lives or criticizing it. That is definitely not good for children to learn at that age. Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone else has a decision at what to read and what to look at. Music, at the library there is mostly music from like a centuries ago, but they were also great composers. No the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music. There's also new music, everyone has different taste and should choose what they want to listen to or who to listen to. Movies, are a big part of life, so I think. There's a lot from them that I learn from. From slavery to the future, there are movies where I have learned a lot. There is also some videos that are rated R, PG-13, MA, etc. It is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not. There is different reasons why there are certain books, music, magazines, movies that offend people, but it also has a significance. Books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through. I'm glad that I as I grow I know what to learn and when I'm too young to read something. I think it should be allowed because it's for everyone. I don't think nothing should be removed from shelves even if the material is offensive, as each item serves a purpose for someone's education or perspective.
1039	4016	2	3	As a fellow person of the community and a person who often visits the library, I think that books, magazines, movies, etc., should not be taken off the shelf. The reason for this thought is because, although it may be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another. Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world. This in turn makes the world illiterate. Libraries provide multiple things that are not family discretion but, to the right age group offers a lot of knowledge. Movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there due to entertainment reasons. I feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as whether it is offensive to a certain quantity of people. The removal of these things might become harmful to a new generation in the long run. I personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways. I have read multiple books that have been acquired from all different sections of the library. Some even pertaining to racism of my own ethnicity that uses words that are not to my liking. I tolerate with the words due to the fact that I would like to know what my ancestry had to do in order for me to get where I am today. Magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. As like movies though they are there to provide entertainment. Most people like to use the library for a time of relaxation. The library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something. In conclusion, as a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attendee, I think that things should not be taking off of shelves. Libraries provides various things that are not at a family discretion level but, may provide help to other people. Some books pertain to racism of ethnicity. It's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are. Things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you shouldn't read or watch it, as personal choice is the key principle in a public library.
1040	4017	2	3	There are two things that I would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf. First being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it may or may not be. Second, no matter what you do or try to do there will always be something that a child will do or see that you may not want them to see or do. If people could remove things that they find offensive then there wouldn't be anything on shelves or in stores or really anywhere. There are too many different kinds of people who might dislike too many different things from anyone else. If a person were to remove a book, and another person wanted to get that book, but found that a person requested it to be removed that person wouldn't be happy and stop coming back to that library after one person had to ruin something they enjoy because they found it offensive. So what if a book found offensive was removed? There are much worse things on television. Cartoons are more violent then what most books are, more and more commercials and other types of advertising are using women, money, and fame to lure people. Most of the time they are not meant for children, a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product, or some kind of adult enjoyment, they are part of life. No matter what you may try to do to keep your child 'safe', it just will not work these days. No matter hard a person might try to change something they find offensive there will be something just as equal around the next corner, be it a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band, someone will always find something offensive and teach their children to do the same but, just because someone may not like something does not mean their children or anyone else's children will not either. Therefore, the effort to remove materials is ultimately futile and infringes upon the rights and interests of other community members.
1041	4018	2	3	Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's a classic novel with controversial themes or a modern film with explicit content, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press. You could take any famous work and someone could be offended by it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the United States we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age. To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. Judith Krug stated that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' By saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended by every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances. The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going by making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. By allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, by keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history.
1042	4019	2	3	The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials may be offensive towards the foriegn and children. Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all R-rated movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves. One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on Mexico and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the Mexican people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the Mexican people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made! Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie. We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves to maintain a respectful and safe environment for all patrons.
1043	4020	2	3	I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf. I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children. This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about. This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book. I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older. Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at. Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated G or PG, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated R or NC-17 then my kids can forget about watching it. So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to. And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain. I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so. There are so many inappropriate books, movies, magazines out there in today's libraries, it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home, which is why parental vigilance is so crucial.
1044	4021	2	3	If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed? In the following I want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries. If some parents see a book they are offended by, and they don't think their children should be able to get it from the library, they could just forbid them to read it. I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might think other children shouldn't be able to get it either, but that's not their decision. Every parent has to decide on their own, if they want their children to get certain books, but one parent shouldn't be able to decide for everyone else by removing a book. Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, doesn't mean that everyone else is going to be offended by it. Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed? It is their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it they would also keep other people from reading it, and that is not fair. Different people like different books, and are offended by different books, so if everyone would remove a book they don't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left. I think if someone is offended by a book, they just shouldn't read it. They could tell their friends and family not to read it, because they thought it was offensive, but in the end everyone should decide for themselves. I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries, but if the library itself thinks a book is offensive, then they shouldn't have it. It is their library, so it's their decision what books they want to have there. i also think that when the library doesn't have certain books, because they really pay attention to the books they take in their library, that that should be good enough for other people. So all in all I don't think people should be able able to remove certain books, because everyone has their own opinion towards what is offensive, and what isn't. We all should be able to read or see, what we want to, and not what others think we should, preserving the library as a space for diverse ideas.
1045	4022	2	3	Everywhere I go, there always seems to be something, small or big, that can be considered offensive. Because of these offensive things, there is often censorship in public places. It is acceptable to view non-noncensored materials at your own disgression and privacy, but not very acceptable to do so in public. I believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences, the public materials, and the opinions of certain people. Libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences. Whether it be children, teens, adults, or elders, some things are inappropriate and should not be accessible to certain people. This is directed mainly to children, however. Like the quote mentioned, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Why put these offensive books in libraries then? Censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups. Because libraries are considered public places, their materials are considered public property. Everyone has the right to these materials. However, not every library will have the book, magazine, or movie you could be searching for due to the fact that it may contain profanity, or inappropriate content. Some people may be against censorship in libraries, but there often is not censorship in bookstores, movie stores, music libraries, etc. If you desire a certain non-censored material, then go purchase it. That way the material will no longer be public, but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose. We now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so. Libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone. Certain parents do not allow their children to read certain books, view certain movies, or listen to certain music and this is just because it is their opinion and their parenting. Some parents, on the other hand, do allow their children to partake in inappropriate materials, and that is perfectly fine, because it is their parenting and their children. However, libraries should not have the right to introduce inappropriate things into the lives of children; that should be the decision of the parents or gaurdians. In conclusion, censorship should be allowed in libraries because of the wide-range audience, public materials, and the strong opinions of the people. Everyone deserves to read, watch, and listen to whatever they choose, but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places. Not everyone can be happy, but everyone can be appropriate.
1046	4023	2	3	In my experience some music is just too offensive. They use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages. Even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people. Some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see. The fact that they put these things in a public library shocks me greatly. One day I was babysitting a little girl and I had taken her to the library. There was a CD on a shelf and she put it in her portable music player. It was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it. I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age. As soon as I put my ear to her headphones, I turned it off immediately. They should really watch what music they put out to the public because if I hadn't of been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words. I don't think parents would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really. It discriminates against women and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities. One other thing they put out in libraries I don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature. I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and I picked up a popular fashion magazine. I was flipping through the pages and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself, 'what if a young child picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have. I've read somewhere that things children see at a young age have a great effect on who they will become. If this is true I certainly think we should censor what we put out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library. We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have. We should also monitor the movies they watch and keep a close eye on the things they read to protect their innocence.
1047	4024	2	3	No, I don't think anything should be removed because not everyone wants to look at the same thing. I think if you don't like it, you should simply not look at it, so there is no need to remove it no matter what the content may be. Everyone has different tastes and interests, and what one person finds offensive, another might find valuable or entertaining. A public library should serve the entire community, which is made up of individuals with diverse viewpoints. Removing material based on one person's or one group's disapproval sets a problematic precedent. It is a better practice to allow people to make their own choices about what they consume. Therefore, the solution is personal responsibility, not the censorship of available materials for everyone else.
1048	4025	2	3	"A quote from Katherine Paterson voices a strong point on citizenship: ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether it's a book, a magazine article, or even a TV show, things are censored. Censoring things doesn't make anything more enjoyable, but in fact makes fewer things enjoyable. I think that things that are offensive should not be removed from the shelf. Censorship disables the viewer or reader from being able to enjoy the full potential of things. I myself watch TV shows all of the time. When they censor things it makes me angry. I already know what the words are, so why censor it? Mark Twain wrote a famous book called The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and that book has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term. I have two things to say about it. One, if it offends you then you shouldn't watch or read it. Second, one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then. So then one could take into thought when the book was written and the context of its setting. There are two books that I read called The Giver and Fahrenheit 451. Both books have one thing in common: the use of censorship in their society. In Fahrenheit 451, books are censored. The main character causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn't fair for books to be banned. Also in The Giver, a boy challenges his controlled society because they too censored certain things. Censorship also happens in today's media. Some examples are television shows. TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore. Now it's understandable to censor children's shows, but censoring shows for mature audiences is unacceptable considering the freedom of speech one can express. Also, mature shows are only meant for mature people to watch them, so why censor them? Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote. I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don't read or watch it. If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compel others into believing what you think, then you are wrong. People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored, as this is a fundamental part of a free society."
1049	4026	2	3	Does censorship solve any problems? If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that argument trying to protect that work from being taken away. As a free country, it is every individual's right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road. The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their prerogative to choose their own material. Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young. It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read. If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned. For example, take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music. It is a great mental image of serenity and peace. How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves? Suddenly, right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a certain book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad. Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers. With this system, everyone suffers. Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to. It would all just be simpler if books were just not banned from libraries. History has given the world many a cruel dictator. Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms. To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights. This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship. If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes. With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused. Now imagine that censorship occurring in a country that has civil rights. People would not stand for it. So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom? There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing. Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights. There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence. Almost everyone can remember a time as a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble. That can disappear in an instant. Children should not be exposed to things that are inappropriate for their age. Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown adult, materials present in it. The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point. A claim like this might sound hypocritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young. Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children. It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon. The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people. Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship. Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy. Therefore, why censor anything at all in a society that values freedom?
1050	4027	2	3	I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be removed. I don't think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better. Kids don't like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us and can make reading more engaging. If this world didn't have movies, kids wouldn't read as many books. Most of these kids nowadays read books because they watched the movie adaptation of the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading, which can help them focus. I'm glad people invented these things. I feel like if people didn't invent these things, this world would be a much more boring place. Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on. Magazines are entertaining to people. I say they are because they have pictures, gossip, and much more. Magazines are good to read; they help a lot of people to read better and stay informed about current events. It's also bad because kids might read it and start doing what they see or read in the magazine. Some books are good, and some are bad. I say that because some books get out of control with cursing and the cover of the books, meaning the pictures. Some authors write good things and some write bad things, but that is part of having a variety of perspectives available. I hope you get something out of what I wrote. This is how I feel about books, magazines, music, and movies. I love to read and listen to all of them. I enjoy books a lot because they open up new worlds and ideas for everyone who reads them.
1051	4028	2	3	When @LOCATION2 was founded and our forefathers signed the constitution of the @LOCATION1, freedom was the paramount principle. With every signature endorsement added to the document, @LOCATION2 became one of the few nations guaranteeing freedom in every right. Foundational laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and the freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress their own people. Freedom is @LOCATION2's middle name and it is the birthright for our future! The exercise of free speech has been shown everywhere, and even though some people's voices say a little too much, it is still a right given to us, so we must accept the nonsense that is sometimes said. Offensive things are common, since we are all different and the variety of ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 is so vast, that at one point in time someone's toes are going to get seriously stepped on. This is not socially tolerated but still it goes on throughout the world. Freedom of speech is an open form of expression, since it is allowed to say what you feel, but sometimes it is said too much and you can end up in a verbal fight.  Speech is still a fundamental freedom though, and if we were to cut out freedom we would be in a terrible spot. Genocide and unlawful imprisonment are two tragic factors that happen regularly in nations on account of having no freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure in such places, you go to jail. If you believe in something different, armies come and kill you, all because some countries do not have freedom like @LOCATION2. This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as certain reading material and videos, but it is a lot better than living under the shadow of a dictator. Crude forms of expression always end up in magazines, books, and CDs, but if you think about it, they are being produced because they are being bought, or they would not be made at all. On certain occasions, items are not made for economical benefit but merely on belief and religious values, which is also a freedom that many have paid for with their lives to have. Also, with the production of books, movies, and CDs, you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like; these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product you can simply put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy.  I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon; we might just have to keep living with offensive products. We should all just be glad we live in a free society that lets us express our differences without being killed in the process. You cannot just go take the constitution and discard it like trash, so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom. Freedom comes on discs and in books, but it is still @LOCATION2's middle name and the birthright to our future.
1052	4029	2	3	Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I cannot choose a definitive side as they are both understandable positions. Therefore, I will discuss how I feel about it in this essay and what I have experienced on this topic.  Well, let us get started! I could go both ways with this. But first, I will just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is interesting to many people might not be interesting to me. I mean, everyone should be able to listen to and read things that they love and enjoy. And I could really care less what other people love to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we would not every think we would. It is just that simple. I mean, I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. No one can tell anyone what they should like or dislike.  I agree in a way too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you to make sure your room is clean all the time! I agree with this because something may be too offensive to someone and they do not want their children exposed to it. One time I was in a library looking at a book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I should not read it because it was too much for me. But it was just right for me. She went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, 'Are you serious?' I did not want to be rude so I told her calmly, 'Why are you so worried about what I am reading?' She replied, 'Because, the book is too revealing.' I showed her what the book was called, and we ended the argument. I still checked out the book, because I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside that they think will be offensive and let people ask for the things they want. So people will not make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want.  Well, I am done now. I hope you understand both sides of the argument. Just remember that you can agree or disagree. Or you can be like me, who cannot choose a side and understands both perspectives. It is your decision and no one can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I cannot pick a side because either way, they are both understandable.
1053	4030	2	3	I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel as though it is that person's own choice whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came across an article that upset me. Also, I have had an argument once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.  Once when I was reading a paper that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upset me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone else's opinion. I realized that just because they wrote that article, it does not make it objectively true. This argument I had with a friend went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artist's CD. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my stereo and turned it off. She told me she did not like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel it is great music and I should not have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I would not listen to it, as I felt I should respect her feelings.  Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their personal opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is right to say. I mean, if a book is on the shelf and you dislike it, do not pick it up and read it; that is the simplest solution for everyone.
1054	4031	2	3	I do not think so due to the fact that most libraries in towns and cities are open to the public. If a person or persons find a piece of material offending, then they should simply pass the item by. Or they can choose to skim over it without a deep commitment. On the other hand, the person or persons does have the right to freedom of speech but should not exceed their opinion above the level of the law.  If music is played in the library that others do find offensive, then in my opinion yes, they should and can speak up for their rights. Books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if some feel offended. This is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many, many different kinds of books available. This is because people have different personalities which mean we will like different things. That does not mean that others cannot speak their opinion because, like I said earlier, everyone in the United States of America has the right to speak what is on their mind. Even though it may not be what others want to hear, they can still do it as long as it is within legal bounds.  Well, that is my opinion on what I think should happen regarding the availability of diverse materials in our public spaces.
1055	4032	2	3	I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries, they listen to 'rebel' music, or they just watch controversial movies, so is censoring really effective? I do not think censoring is really necessary. If you think a subject might be offensive for you, you should not read it. Instead of censoring the products in a library, we should trust the readers to censor themselves; I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Media is just another way to gain knowledge, which is why they are used at school.  I would like to go to my school library and find books like, 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'. I know this book is considered as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literature works, but it was once banned from some schools around the nation. The reason for the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography, and it was not school appropriate. My English teacher used this method, by telling us this, to encourage us to read it. My classmates who had not read the book wanted to find the pornography in it; if you were to ask me... I did not find it. Another literary work which was banned once is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. This book was banned because @PERSON1, a black character in the book, was called a @CAPS4, and was thought to be stupid sometimes during the book. Even though @PERSON1 is the most noble and innocent character in the book, some people found this offensive and not appropriate. Movies with strong language are rated for their public, so I do not think this should be a problem. Music, on the other hand, depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents, not institutions.  I truly believe that we should not censor any material in libraries, but if it is absolutely necessary, they could establish an age limit to check-out any controversial material. As I said before, media is just another way to gain knowledge and should be accessible for those who seek it.
1056	4033	2	3	As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press. However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries. I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit. Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a separate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age. Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material. Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young. This system would balance access with protection. Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense. If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library. Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material and will guide their choices. Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results. There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms. They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not. That other person might want to use the material for research or personal interest, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited. It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute. People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them. I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself. When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do. They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason. However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus. I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that. When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves. The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom. To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it.
1057	4034	2	3	I believe certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and are inappropriate. The reason why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways, emotionally and psychologically. But when the people make and read these items they don't know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker. I also had experienced an offensive book and an inappropriate book. When I went to a public library I picked up @CAPS1 book and said to myself '@CAPS1 might be a good book I can do for my book report' so as I picked up the book and flipped through the pages I saw words and images that offended me. There was words that were calling color people out by their names and pictures of the color women getting raped or abused. So I did not get that book I just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong. So @CAPS1 white lady 'The librarian' came up to me and asked me did I need help finding anything, but I did not answer her I just looked at her and shook my head. As I walked through the library I saw inappropriate books such as '@CAPS2 books' that these kids were looking at I could not believe what I was seeing. Because I think they should have these books somewhere else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs. Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listening to because it can effect their future in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harassment stuff that will get our younger children in trouble as they get older. I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.D. to prove you are @NUM1 and older, ensuring a safer environment for everyone.
1058	4035	2	3	Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Censorship in libraries should never be an issue. It is a very simple concept. Obviously, no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies. If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to worry about what their children will be looking at there. A library should be a family-friendly place where children can get together for story time, or where college students can study in a quiet atmosphere. I remember going to the library all the time when I was younger. I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community. It was something I enjoyed doing and felt safe. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and enjoy themselves without concern? Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc. It is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building. Parents should tell their children that the adult section is off-limits, and the library employees should keep children from ever being in that restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children. However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want for their own purposes. That's why they shouldn't be taken off of the shelves completely, just removed from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc. I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Even though I don't personally see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't get to view these items. All in all, we have to be fair. Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive? No, nobody wants that. However, we still have to be reasonable about it. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed. It's just common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate to make this work. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope that you can see it my way, and help me in fixing this issue once and for all. Sincerely, @LOCATION1.
1059	4036	2	3	We all have that favorite book, mine is 'OF @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 is a book I would recommend to anybody, but there are libraries that have some books that are so bad I would be scared if my mom even picked it up and looked at the cover. My name is @PERSON1, and during @CAPS3 essay I am going to show you what I am talking about. I love to read during the day. I like to go out and just pick a book right off the shelf and start then and there reading, but when I see a book or a magazine that holds sexual acts in them I become very angered. I have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of an adult like their mothers. They can go to a public library where they're children (as young as the age of five) and read and look at these terrible things. I don'@CAPS4 know why these books are even needed in a library. Now people can get on the @CAPS4.V's and buy or rent them. I have a best friend who lost his father to these sexual acts and pictures. My friend's mother had enough and had to kick him out. Now my friend is becoming the same person. He can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library. He doesn'@CAPS4 even recognize that his father did the same thing. He still never wants to see his father, but what he is doing is the same thing that his father also did. I have had various talks with @CAPS3 friend, but he said it isn'@CAPS4 hurting anybody, but what he doesn'@CAPS4 see is that he is hurting me and our friendship. Back in the late @NUM1's early @NUM2's parents saw some of the books that their children were reading. They tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked. Since then @CAPS3 problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control. The libraries do @CAPS3 all for money they make. More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a sex high. @CAPS3 is where about half of the libraries money is being made. The government tries to stay out of @CAPS3, because the money they get through taxes is coming of these people. When will it stop? No one really knows, but we will try to stop it all we can. The reason for @CAPS3 essay was to show why the process needs to be stopped. If you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out, you will then know what I am saying. I will try to stop it, but probably will not succeed. That will not stop me from helping my friends in the future. Just be glad that you know about it now and can make informed choices.
1060	4037	2	3	Offensive much? That's what multiple people feel towards certain books. For instance if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an atheist, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtful to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resource that is very helpful, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects. First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebrities. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves. Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then I'll tell you a little about @CAPS5. @CAPS5's about America, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5. @CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about Americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the beginning of time @CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to Americans. Without music there would be chaos. Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our entertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instance the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind. In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive impact on your thoughts, and feelings about the value of diverse media.
1061	4038	2	3	There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act. Organizations like @ORGANIZATION1 depict beautiful as half dressed and makeup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library? Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to discuss yet, such as mature relationships or body image issues. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped and artificially enhanced. If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body, which is clearly not healthy at all. Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny and lose weight quickly. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does, as our bodies are all built differently. Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then it would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else, creating a more positive and accepting environment for everyone.
1062	4039	2	3	Have you ever went to the library and seen a book that was too graphic for a certain section? When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section? Well censorship should be in librarys now a days. Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age. Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life, encouraging negative behaviors they are too young to fully understand. In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only people of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magazines from that section. For example, in video stores they have an adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children. Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores; it should be tailored to the library's content. Personaly, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them. So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves, thinking it is acceptable. Librarys do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement, such as a locked cabinet or a separate room. So when taking a younger child to a library go in with and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books, games, magazines, and music. As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive. Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age, ensuring they are guided towards age-appropriate and beneficial content.
1063	4040	2	3	Books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. They have significent value in culture, lives, and everything else. We all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies. What we don't see is how books and magazines are really effecting people of different race, religion, or age. We should take a stand and get rid of these bad books. Negitive books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and ideas that can damage a person's self-worth. We have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are. I remember in @NUM1 grade when a girl named @PERSON1 got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color. Everyone in the book was white and excluded a african american girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough. She went to tell the teacher and the teacher threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like. We need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us, books that promote inclusion and diversity. To boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves. The world has changed and books should too, reflecting the values of kindness and acceptance. Many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion. Books that talk bad about other religions or make you second guess your faith are considered negitive and should be taken off the shelf. How would you like it if someone was putting down your religion? That is how many people feel when reading that kind of material. These books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries where they can cause division and pain. Have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching? Most of childrens books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids but not all of them. Behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes. When fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is ok to kill someone if they are a bad. Boys believe that it is ok to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies. Girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless, leading to unrealistic expectations. Do we really want childrent to think it is ok to fight and be upset because they are not perfect? Libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world. Not all books are bad and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer. We need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves. The books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves in a negative way need to go away for good. To get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden. It can make a really big improvment in adults and children, fostering a healthier state of mind. Please take negitive books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems and to create a more positive and supportive community for all readers.
1064	4041	2	3	Books @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS4 your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @MONTH1 not be suited for their @CAPS3. Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. But some book aren't for children @CAPS3 because they contain complex or mature themes. Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CAPS4 kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @CAPS4 a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will, especially if they are curious. Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things, providing clear guidance for parents. All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3 but some are, and those need to be identified. I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People should'nt think that way because its alot of crule people in this world. I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @CAPS5 should read, as it can be harmful. Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves. But certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different, which makes it a complex issue. Its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf. But its going to keep going on until someone speaks up and advocates for more responsible curation of library collections.
1065	4042	2	3	The material we read in books are sometimes offensive. Books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them. I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what there child reads. I also believe that Censorship is a good thing sometimes to protect young and impressionable minds. The material we find in books is not as much of a proplem to our youth as any other thing. The reasoning for me saying this is that youth to day are not really woried about picking up a book and reading is as much as them picking up a magazine, cellular phone, iPod or using a computer. I believe magazines are worse than any book. Books are reed mostly for knowledge wereas magazines are mostly reed for people to catch up on the latest trends, often focusing on celebrity gossip and unrealistic beauty standards. Magazines can lead to people listing to the next hotest band, singer or rapper, whatever, and adopting the lifestyles promoted within them. Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics. Then people get pulled in. Music doesn't have rating were movies do, making it harder for parents to monitor. Movies are a little easier to control because of there ratings but children are alway going to get there hands on it no matter what, through friends or older siblings. This is were the internet comes into play. Most people have acsess to a computer. Children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't ment for them to see, from violent content to explicit material. Internet is also use to educate, which is its positive aspect. The internet also opens up the doors to video games. Children can play with there friends all around the world now without leaving there bedroom. They also play with complete stranger, which poses its own risks. Some of the other player could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music, magazines, music, ect.., that send a bad
1066	4043	2	3	One book or movie doesn't make a difference in the huge library full of books and movies. That's why the books, magazines, or movies shouldn't be removed from the book shelf of the library. They shouldn't be removed because some parents of the children don't care what their kids listen to or read. Only if they are doing what the parent says. Also the parents might think too much of their kid and think that their kid knows what books you want them to get or don't get. Although, if you're one of those parents that not only care about what your children read or listen to, and you realize that every kid doesn't know what their parent wants, then you should talk to the school's principal and see if there is a way that you could come up with an area of the library that is just for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have, or ever read, or you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they care about these types of books. Then there are some kids who like to read those types of books and would be very disappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf, and they didn't have anything else to read, but everybody else in the school got to have their favorite books in school. If someone were to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable. I would say to them that, it's not the book. The kids chose to read the book in the first place, so it would be their own doing if their life changed. Finally, that's the reason why books shouldn't be taken off the book shelf because some people like them, and if you are some of the kids or parents who don't like them or don't want their kids reading them, then have the librarian make a note to say they aren't allowed to check them out. This approach respects everyone's interests and maintains the library's role as a resource for all.
1067	4044	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once commented, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Many people in society share Katherine's view, while some believe in strict library censorship. It is important not to infringe on the rights of other people, suppress freedom of speech, or limit their knowledge. Therefore, I support her sentiment. If materials are thought to be inappropriate for children, or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be set up in the home by the parents, not by a public institution. America was founded upon the need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and press. If we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are destroying a nation's core values. Can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to? Furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where do we draw the line? Anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, that does not mean we should immediately take it off the shelf of an important public institution. If you do not want to take my word for it, look back at history. What kind of civilization was Nazi Germany? Not one you would want to live in I suppose. Hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom. They started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books. First, it was just viewed as unsavory to have a book they deemed offensive, in this case it was the works of Jewish, African-American, or communist authors. Later on they started to burn these books, and punish people for having them in their possession. If we are to live in a country, where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books. This seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequences than foreseen. Many families have different values they want to pass on to their children, morals they hope to teach them. The problem is, is that each families' limits and values are unique; We cannot just assume anything about families in general. I personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read, watch or listen to. On the other hand, I am acquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read. What one set of parents want to limit their child from reading may vary from another set of parents. If they find material they do not want their children to read, then they should censor in the home. They could start with a discussion about why the material is inappropriate, and give the child the responsibility to obey their parents. It helps the parents become more involved in their childrens' lives and it aids the children in personal growth with responsibility and respect. In the end, it all boils down to freedom. Do we want to live in a country with freedom of press and the right to publicly access it. My answer is yes, and I believe it is the answer of my fellow citizens too. We cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different. Therefore we cannot bring our opinions down on the public institution, but the home. It is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion, and we must uphold the foundational freedoms that define our nation.
1068	4045	2	3	Most people consider libraries an unharmful place. However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on its shelves. Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a romance novel with a nude lady on the cover. I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well. Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries. A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way; by reading books! Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image? Nudity, cursing, and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library. It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine. What kind of message are we trying to send to them? That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus? I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries. Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries. Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well. We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on a controversial celebrity. Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon. I'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past. No matter where you are you cannot escape offensive gestures; but please let's keep it out of the library to preserve its purpose as a safe and wholesome environment for discovery.
1069	4046	2	3	Do you want your children to have bad images in their head? Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want? I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have no business being in libraries. These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them. First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material. This material can create a very ambitious young child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents. I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time. Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual. Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material. Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material. In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out. Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library may have. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed, leading to a more positive and constructive environment for everyone.
1070	4047	2	3	As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate. However this should be their decision and only their's; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books. In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them. When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate. Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to. So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it; and disobey parents. They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education. So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway. So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it. Do you want that? It is better to guide them through open discussion rather than imposing restrictions that may provoke rebellion.
1071	4048	2	3	The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years, generating significant public discourse. It has been discussed by many people, but a clear and decisive conclusion has never been reached. I firmly say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are currently proposed, as such restrictions would have limited my early exploration. I think that there should be no censoring of libraries because it would impair our basic rights. Such as our fundamental right to freedom of expression. And our right freedom to the press. We would no longer live in a free country but a totalitarian state, which contradicts the principles our nation was founded upon. Though if they would put an age restriction on certain things that might please the debaters, it could be a potential compromise. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed as a sensible measure. Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials appropriate for their age, protecting them while preserving access for others. Though it is ultimately the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to, not the libraries. It's the parents who introduce the children to music, magazines, and books in the first place. If the parents started to censor these materials early on and took an active role, this debate would not be going on as it is today. The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years, showing no signs of abating. Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice for a free society. @PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then there will be no more books for any of us,' a powerful warning against the slippery slope of removal.
1072	4049	2	3	I do not believe that such things as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries, as they are vital repositories of knowledge and culture. First, books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults, offering perspectives that are crucial for development. Just because a book talks about the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying might be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults who can process such complex themes. Also books give a message about how times use to be, providing historical context that is essential for understanding our past. Take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black @CAPS9 back then. Just because it has some words that are frowned upon does not mean that kids and @CAPS9 shouldn't know about it and where it came from so they won't go around offending @CAPS9 and they don't even know what the word means, which is an important lesson in history and language. Next, movies now some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups and I understand that concern, but movies like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 are teaching us our @ORGANIZATION1 and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each others race. Also movies gives a more visual way of what things were like so we can kind of get a interactive way on how things look like and how you can relate the book to the movie, enhancing the learning experience. Movies also make points, some state if we don't do anything about pollution this is whats going to happen, serving as a cautionary tale. So movies are definitely a stay on my list of essential library materials. In addition, a big factor of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 is music, which serves as a cultural barometer. I could see how some music could be bad but also some artist talk about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a get away for them, providing an authentic voice for struggle. Plus, music isn't hurting anybody directly; it is a form of artistic expression. We learn how music was in the @DATE1 and compare it to music now, tracing societal changes. We also learn how music evolves from one thing to another, kind of creating off of itself, demonstrating artistic innovation. Music has the power to say things and communicate with @CAPS9 and make statements that could only be made by music, conveying emotion in a unique way. For example, take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think. Now take that speech put it in a song form and I guarantee that more @CAPS9 capture the message and take it into there grasp on how they could help the cause, making the message more accessible and memorable. Especially if it is by their favorite artist. Say your favorite artist is @CAPS7 @PERSON1, now wouldn't you rather listen to @CAPS7 @PERSON1 make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by @ORGANIZATION2? So music is most definitely staying on the list because it has the power to move @CAPS9, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in away before. Last, magazines, some Magazines are just inappropriate and contain content not suitable for all audiences. Now I'm pretty sure that you will not be seeing those magazines on shelves of a public library so nobody should be worried about that, as libraries exercise discretion. Now some magazines like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 are just there for fun and they are not hurting anybody because its just pictures and honestly no child would read the words of a interview with a famous person, they would just look at the images. So magazines are harmless in a library and are only there to stay up on current events and to inform @CAPS9 on if a new discovery was made or whats going on in the @ORGANIZATION1. In conclusion, I do not believe that things such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere, as they collectively form the cornerstone of a free and informed society.
1073	4050	2	3	Some things on the shelves in book stores and other places can be very offensive to various groups of people. I think having cuss words in music and sexually explicit things can be offensive to women, portraying them in a degrading manner. I do listen to some music but nothing like that because I think it should not be in music and books, as there are more constructive forms of expression. One day I Think the @CAPS1.S.A will be ran by a woman, which would be a significant step forward for equality. There is nothing wrong with that prospect. Woman have the same rights as @CAPS2 do, a principle that should be universally acknowledged. There are some people that think woman are just their slaves, that is dead wrong and an outdated mindset. Woman and @CAPS2 are the same no matter what people say, deserving of equal respect and opportunity. Katherine Paterson has the right idea though about personal responsibility. It would be great if the law would state that if you think something is offensive you should be able to take it off the shelf and throw it away, but some people would say otherwise because there are some people out there who just care about them selfs and acted whatever way they want to so they can act or make them selfs feel better than they are. There are some kids who like to look and go though magazines and see all that bad thing they think that those people are cool so they teaches them how to acted and do bad things, That is why I think we should be able to take it off the shelves to protect impressionable youth. There was this one day I was in @CAPS4-mart just looking around and I saw a magazines with some movie star holding her three kids. The title of the magazine was superstar. It really hurt to see those three kids on the cover because one day they might not be like their parents and have all the money in the world, facing a much different reality. It might seem really stupid these days that some people would care this much about such matters, I really think deep down that its life and we all need to get over our selfs because we can not all be right and have all the same feelings for life, and we must learn to coexist with differing opinions. All my life I have thought about this subject cause it seems like now days its all about the money, what they wear and what type of car or truck they drive. It seems really stupid but when I see someone who drives a new car worth @MONEY1 it really makes me think about how someone has the money for this car and everything else, highlighting the materialistic values that often dominate public discourse.
1074	4051	2	3	Libraries are essential community institutions. What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books, they are multimedia hubs. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more, catering to diverse interests. All of the things are not for just one particular age, which is part of their inclusive design. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them, reflecting the varied tastes of the public. The library in my town has certain place for children, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated things, attempting to organize content appropriately. Not all people agree with what should be allowed in a public area, leading to ongoing debate. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be interesting to them, fulfilling an educational and recreational mission. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects, they strive for balance. When I go to the library I think I would mind if I saw some @CAPS1-rated thing out in the open. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want, I also recognize the need for discretion. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people, a practical compromise. Having these areas would help parents and children feel a lot better about what they would hear or see at a library, making it a more comfortable environment for families. What can be done about this problem of access and exposure? Even though it might cost more or be too difficult for an owner of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be a good thing to do, a structural solution. If smaller children see things such as violence, drugs, and sex, they might think that it is ok to do, which is a legitimate concern for parents. Most parents try and keep their kids away from those parts of the library but don't always succeed in their vigilance. So therefore I think that building rooms for these areas is the right thing to do to assist parents in their efforts. Even though we all think different things should or shouldn't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there entirely, as censorship is a complex issue. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do, minimizing unintended exposure. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If you ever have kids would you like for them to see it? I would hope not, as most desire to protect childhood innocence. So try and make the better choice when you find inappropriate things for younger viewers, advocating for responsible stewardship of shared spaces.
1075	4052	2	3	As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I think we all can agree with that sentiment. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read, an almost universal experience. I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults, as this constitutes a form of intellectual control. When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn from a full spectrum of ideas. Yes, they might choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read, as that infringes on personal freedom. Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.' It is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver, a truly horrifying concept. I have never seen that movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to, as it sounds deeply disturbing. It seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for this argument because what some do not want to learn from, others can derive meaning from. I would never watch it or anything like it but my friends who have watched it have learned something from the experience. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun,' a grim but potent lesson about societal vulnerabilities. I kid you not, after hearing about that sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless, showing how even negative content can provoke positive personal resolve. That brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, this video can not be on the internet,' none of my friends would have seen it or told me about it. Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person in the same way, potentially altering my life trajectory. Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos, a hyperbolic but illustrative chain of events. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be, emphasizing the value of the lesson learned. In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn from a wide array of materials. We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool, a poignant summary of the argument. If we all took away the materials that we felt were inappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left, leading to an impoverished public discourse. As
1076	4053	2	3	Coming from a teenager, offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read in a safe and positive environment. Most books and movies are filled with sex, gang violence, and drugs, which are not appropriate subjects for a public space meant for learning. In my generation sex, drugs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere, and the library should not contribute to this problem. Books are suppose to be about learning and gaining knowledge, not about being exposed to harmful content. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children, who are easily influenced by what they see and read. These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.  Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence, leaving little room for educational content. Children should never be exposed to that type of offensive behavor, as it can shape their worldview in a negative way. You should be able to open a magazine and learn somthing brand new, not be confronted with mature themes. Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics crowding the shelves. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with the topic you dont want, making it difficult to find suitable material. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence, which is frustrating when you are trying to find a good book to read.  If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved with what you read, and constant exposure can normalize these behaviors. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's, which are serious consequences for a young life. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children, but the library should also support parents by providing a safe collection.  Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems for the community and for individual development. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit distracting you from your studies. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something valuable and positive in your local library, ensuring it remains a beneficial resource for everyone.
1077	4054	2	3	The public forum, I read an intresting article the other day by Katherine Paterson an author. The article said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement really makes you think about the consequences of censorship.  I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So I agree completely with Paterson because people have their own opions and what one person finds offensive, another may find enlightening. Some stuff may be more offensive than others to different people, and that is a natural part of having a diverse society. I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to? The answer is yes they should be different, and we should celebrate that diversity rather than suppress it. But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back on the shelf; another person might find it intresting and meaningful.  I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said, as it is a vital topic for our community. I am asking for your help to do so by engaging in a respectful dialogue. I would like you to put the article in The public forum and hear what people have to say about it, fostering a community conversation. Thank You for accepting my request and for considering this important matter concerning our shared public spaces.
1078	4055	2	3	Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It might even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library altogether. Certain materials in libraries should be removed to prevent these negative experiences.  The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset that the library allowed such easy access to this content.  The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library, knowing it has been vetted for appropriateness. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They may not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material will also appreciate this change.  The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that might be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them, making an informed choice.  Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves to create a better environment. It will create a more civil trip to the library for families and individuals alike. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you and ruins your visit. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves for those who seek it out. It's a win win situation for everyone in the community.
1079	4056	2	3	Should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the selves? I know that most people who agree that it would 'better' our kids if the didn't read or listen to certain things. But, what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the self? We would be left with a very empty and limited collection.  I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of it contens. If I look at a certain book and think, 'this book is offending me and my beleives,' then I should just not read the book and choose another one instead. Just becauseit is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offened someone else; it might be exactly what they need to read. Every book that has ever been written has effect someone, either in a good way or a bad way, influencing their thoughts and feelings. Does that mean they have the right to say, 'take them off the shelves?' I do not believe so, as that would be imposing one person's view on everyone.  I remember when I was in second grade, there was these girl in my class who's mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked. The parent was extremly engery at the teacher and, at that time, I didn't know why it was such a big deal. Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying, and they found it offensive. The teacher never played the music in class again and was to afraid to play anyother type of music, which limited our cultural exposure.  Since everyones views are different, by the time every person took off the books that offended them, there would be no books left on any topic. As Katherine Paterson put it, 'But if I have the right to remove that book form the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This powerful quote highlights the logical conclusion of censorship.  In conclusion, I strongly think that books, weather they offended someone or not, should be kept of the selves. Taking the book off wouldn't accomplish anything to begin with, except to limit access to ideas and stories for others.
1080	4057	2	3	I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelfs in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like it shouldnt be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because it might help someone one day understand a difficult topic. Some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because it's not treating people right or portraying them fairly. Then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch, adding to the story. Today im hear to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, it can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and it can also teach us more about offensive material and its context.  Today in are generation we do alot of studing or projects for school, we do this so we know more about the subject and become educated individuals. As a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material to understand its impact. Why would you ask i do this? Because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about it, like its history and effects. Like where did it come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you know and thats a good thing finding out what you dont know about the world. So if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about it or know where it came from, leaving gaps in our education. Its good to still have have books that are offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive by understanding its consequences.  Going to a library is fun and exciteding because you get to read all these books and discover new worlds. Well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days, offering a range of perspectives. In are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries, which provides historical context. Lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days, perhaps for a history class. Well in the library they will have generations of books on offensive material, allowing for comprehensive study. This provides us of offensive material back in the old days and how societal views have changed. So the library is a good thing to have that because we need to know about what happend back in the old days to understand our present.  Everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book that captures their interest. Well i know alot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material, whether for academic or personal reasons. Offensive material to people is like a good book you can read it and learn more about different viewpoints and experiences. Some people think learning to much is a bad thing exspecially when it is on offensive material, fearing it might be harmful. Learning to much is not even a discusion because people can learn whatever they want to, and it is their right to seek knowledge. If the libraries take away the offensive material it is just like talking a good book from you, limiting your intellectual freedom.  People can think what they want to think about offensive material, and that is their right. Like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book, its like taking away a good book from a reader who might benefit from it. People do need to learn about offensive material thats why we still have the books, to provide that opportunity for education. If we didnt want to know about offensive material why did they publish all the books and videos about it in the first place? This is why i think we should have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries, to ensure access to a wide range of information and ideas.
1081	4058	2	3	To whom it may concern: Would you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of literature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, and other media from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs found within the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be allowed to be removed from public or private libraries simply due to their challenging nature. In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music are being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their own lifestyle and what they personally believe, leading them to demand removal.  Literature can be described as art that an individual portrays in his or her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to the present day. This means it has been there through wars, politics, art, and slavery. All of these are a part of literature, so literature is history in its own way, documenting the full spectrum of human experience. Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries; they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not be removed, for it is a part of history. Would you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought it was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their historical beliefs in return that they respect ours by allowing their voices to remain in the record.  Literature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are today. Literature should stay on the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. Would you want to be known for destroying an important part of history? Preserving these works ensures we learn from the past in its entirety.
1082	4059	2	3	Many people have different views and opinions on things. No single opinion or view is inherently right or wrong. Books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the decision for everyone. Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way. If someone was at a library, and thought a particular book series was offensive, they might be the only ones to think that. They can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books. Things often go by majority rule, and that person is not the majority; they are the only one with the problem, and their personal discomfort should not dictate access for all.  Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it. One person can't change everything to fit their specific needs. They would be making plenty of other people unhappy if that type of music was removed from the selection. To make everyone happy, the person could just choose not to listen to it. There's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable, and they can simply select something else. One person cannot make the decisions for everyone. The president doesn't even make the decisions by himself; he has the government helping him. If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to have it removed. They're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the availability of the magazine. It might be inappropriate to them, but other people enjoy reading it and should retain that choice.  I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way. Books, music, movies, and magazines are a few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material. Some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive to some, but one person can't change it for all. Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person simply can't make decisions for everyone in a diverse society.
1083	4060	2	3	Should someone's work categorized as 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for public office to be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries; both are forms of expression. When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when political campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropriate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live television as well.  Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or CDs with lyrics that contain cuss words, do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try, which is why parental guidance is key.  When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not you're talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same creative endeavor. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available for their own selection.  If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ads and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biographies then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropriate' then the song writers and actors will more than likely not have the urge to do it all over again, stifling creativity.  In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone believes that an item is 'inappropriate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropriate' and they think its funny. Surely if the writer or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropriate'? The marketplace of ideas should remain open for all.
1084	4061	2	3	What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the nation it would be completely ridiculous to set one standard for all people. If citizens aren't restricted when it comes to apparel, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resourcefulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the nation, but it would also pose a threat to our future. When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what you're looking for. Say a book on the assassination of a historical figure is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be disappointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would severely limit the library's resources and utility.  Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the nation. How are people supposed to stay informed if they are being shielded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library for information. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests might break out and rebellious citizens might protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society and dividing communities. The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, as well. Citizens are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinite knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many people. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced by teachers or parents. The censorship might start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our decisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten, leading to a homogenized and controlled populace.  Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were censored, not only would knowledge in the nation disintegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of our country. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our founding fathers earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away from us now or ever.
1085	4062	2	3	You should be able to read any book, listen to any music and watch any movie you want, right? Well in some libraries that isn't always the case. Some people find books, music and movies offensive and not suitable for public libraries, leading to calls for their removal. In a public library I think that all books should be there to check out! The books might contain material that is more adult, but that's okay. For the books that are more inappropriate the library needs to offer an adult section, perhaps with restricted access. Just for the books that contain more adult material and are not suitable for younger readers. The person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them and their family.  Music in libraries should not be censored. The lyrics might be inappropriate, but most teenagers listen to that type of music regularly. For younger children they should not be able to check out a CD that is more adult in its themes. In my opinion, for the music that is more adult you should be at least thirteen years old. Children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music without permission. Some parents don't know what their child has checked out from the library. The child should have parent consent to check out any music if under the age requirement, ensuring parents remain involved.  I think that some movies should definitely be removed if they are found to be excessively offensive or graphic. Some movies have scenes that are horrible and that should be in the adult section, away from general view. In a library you aren't expecting to find a movie that contains very adult material. At a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult, but not necessarily in a public library which serves a broader community. Movies for kids to check out should be educational, fun and most importantly, appropriate for their age group! Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and that is exactly right. I would not want my little cousin reading books with racial comments and just plain out inappropriate content for a child that age. Even if the child doesn't understand what all of the content means, they will ask questions that the parent is most likely not ready to answer. As children, they might get the wrong idea in their head and say things that are not right based on what they encountered.  In public libraries, books should generally not be censored, movies should be more carefully considered and possibly censored, and music should not be censored. It all comes down to what do you allow your children to read, watch and listen to? Its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material. Now that you know my opinion on censorship, maybe others will consider this an important topic
1086	4063	2	3	Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and that's what made our country flourish through many years. In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might offend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelves due to the feelings of another person's thoughts. In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more acceptable in media and books. The rights have always been there but not fully practiced. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for their writings. For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perspective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they committed a murder. I do think there is a limit to how you distribute certain books and magazines. They shouldn't sell a book about death, poverty, or sex at a public school, as that is a specific environment for learning. We all have different things we like to read and write about. So why should we be taken away from because someone thinks it's too offensive. I think not, if you don't like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience I have seen bad people do what is expected of them, bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen. That's just an easy way out of a situation. I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do bad things, no! I know I can't speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. are not harmful. But think about it like this, wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather then go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new things and is scientifically proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain, and just because you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more, which is a fundamental benefit of a free society.
1087	4064	2	3	Nowadays, children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine. Some magazines, books, and movies that are age appropriate. Children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines, books, and movies. Should we remove these inappropriate items? Can we somehow get kids to not see them? Children are very curious. They want to know about everything and they will ask as many questions as they can. When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, what do we do? Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that @MONTH1 be inappropriate for children. Instead, there should be a rating system on the books and magazines. Movies have ratings so children don't see things that are inappropriate; books should have those ratings too, perhaps with a small label on the spine. If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids, then they can show the librarian their @CAPS1 for age verification. Everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age. Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate section of the library, a designated adult area. It could be a section that kids could not enter without a parent. Parents should also watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate, guiding their choices. The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity. Children can look onto the shelves, but we should put labels on what they can and can't check out based on these ratings. Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read, using the system as a helpful tool. I believe that's the most we can do without infringing on the rights of other readers.
1088	4065	2	3	There are many libraries with many books, magazines, music, and movies. Some of the things in a library are inappropriate for children. So the library makes a section for the adults and a section for the children. There should just be a children library and then make another library for the adults, or at the very least, a completely separate and secure area. Then I also think that they should take the bad things off the shelf's at libraries entirely. So there are children books and there adult books. In most libraries I have seen that they either have an upstairs for the adults and they have a downstairs for the kids. They also have toys down there for kids so if their parents want to go upstairs then the kids can sit there and play with the toys, safely away from the adult materials. Then I also think that they should take off the bad things on the shelves. Because what happens if a kid goes up with their mom or dad and opens a book and sees something very inappropriate? So they should be taken off the shelves in a library, and if someone wants to buy them then will have to go online or to the store and buy them, keeping the library a safe space. The people that own the library or are in the library should take all the bad magazines, music, books, and etc. off the shelves. It is a very bad thing to have at a public place, and that should not be allowed. The public libraries should take all the inappropriate things off the shelves to protect children from harmful content, ensuring a family-friendly environment for everyone.
1089	4066	2	3	Libraries have books, magazines, movies, etc. The library is a wonderful place to read in a quiet place. It can also be an offensive place to some people. They think they can complain and bicker about it, but should all those activities be removed from the library shelves? But whose opinion is it anyways? If I found an offensive book, movie, or magazine on a shelf at a library I would just leave it. Apparently it's not a bad thing because if it was they wouldn't have it on a shelf. So if I got offended by it I wouldn't look at it or pick it up. I mean it's that simple. A library is full of well, about everything you would enjoy. Many different people like different books and movies to read and watch, that means the library has a right to put whatever they @MONTH1 want. Even if it is offensive to some people, it may be valuable to others. With my experiences in a library nothing has came across to be offensive to me. I'm a kind of person that doesn't care. However I have seen some books where the author is making fun of the @CAPS1 people. Also @CAPS2 seen a book where the author is writing about the black people and how they used to be treated and some of the book has the @PERSON1 in it which is a major racism to black people, which is a part of history. It could be an unfair situation to some people that have kids with them and an inappropriate book is on the shelf and they see it. That could be offensive to the children and the parents. Or it could even be in a magazine. But why should the books magazines and etc. be taken off the shelves when it's not offensive to all people? If the librarians took all the offensive books off the shelves then there wouldn't be any left, as everyone is offended by different topics. Everyone has different things that can offend them. If you don't like how the book is you can take it to your friend and they can read it or you can just turn it back into the library. You can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive material it has given you. Books, movies, magazines and etc are all in a library. They could be offensive or not. If you think they are then don't look at it or read it. It's that simple, get it or don't, but don't try to remove it for everyone else.
1090	4067	2	3	If we remove all books we think shouldn't be on the shelves, what would there be to read? So many books have great detail in them to give us a vivid picture about what we're reading. Even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming. I don't think we should have to remove books, music, movies etc., just because they are found offensive to some people. Instead of removing the books others love to read, what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music. Or put the books some people find offensive in their own area, a special section. If all books were rated like movies, we would know just what we're buying or checking out. Movies are rated by the language and content they have in it. Books should be the same way, with clear guidelines. Or if someone was to find a book or magazine offensive they should be put in a different location with a label identifying that they could be offensive to others. I do not think they should just be removed and out of the way entirely. I think having books that are too offensive should be put in their own bookshelves. By doing this, people would know not to let their children go near them because they have been labeled clearly. And like rated '@CAPS1' movies a minor needs to be with an adult. But with books you should be fine with your own choice at the age of @NUM1, which is a reasonable compromise. In my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done. There's a bunch of books I can think of that would not be suitable for young children. Yet little kids love to read and could easily take a book off the shelf if they so pleased, which is why labeling is so important. Many parents complain about what their children read, watch, or listen to everyday. Labeling would be such a great way to control a bit of what they hear and see each day. I think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it. I'm not saying to throw away the offensive books, music, movies, etc., but to label them so others know what they are going to read or see. I believe this would be an excellent way to make sure our children don't read the things we as parents wouldn't want them to read or check out, while still preserving access for everyone.
1091	4068	2	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've recently finished reading a quote from the great author Katherine Paterson and her feelings towards the certain type of material used in books. For example, some @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offended by certain types of language used in books. Other @MONTH1 just feel the pictures are not quite appropriate. With that being said, I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with, you should just pick up another book instead. My belief is that many authors feel like a book is a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world. Authors shouldn't be denied the opportunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings. @CAPS1 shouldn't be allowed to give hateful opinions just because they didn't like a book. As I see it, no one is forcing them to read it. Now I'm not saying I'm a huge reader. As a matter of fact, I barely read, but when I do start reading I sometimes am eager to keep on reading. The way authors describe things, even with sometimes profanity, is just amazing. You can actually feel that you're part of the book. Now then my point is that even though to many @CAPS1 a book @MONTH1 be horrible, but to others it @MONTH1 be the best book in the world. So if you do start taking down books from the shelves you would end up with nothing but a huge, empty shelf. There's no book out there that is what we would consider 'The perfect book.' @CAPS2 book can be given a nasty comment but then again @CAPS2 book can also be given the best comments. This world is too big to start picking and choosing. My beliefs won't be the same as yours but this is how I feel and this is how I will keep on feeling. So tell me, what's your belief then?
1092	4069	2	3	Have you ever went to a library and found that some books aren't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading. I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way too extreme for kids to be reading or watching. I personally think that children who aren't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed to rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books. Some of you are probably like 'but it's not like they're going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that definitely won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. No parent is ready to tell their child at the age of three what a four letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then that's when you can bring out the older books or movies. But don't let them read it on their own. Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when they hit the age @CAPS5 and up. That's when you as a parent can start letting them read and watch older movies and books. Twelve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on their own. That's when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way too extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on their own; they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handle it. In conclusion I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one to @CAPS5. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. Then once they hit high school they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about.
1093	4070	2	3	Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children. I do agree that certain books are not appropriate for some children. Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries? Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can write what we want on paper because it's what we want; it's called freedom. Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the appropriate age groups. Books are a great part of a student's learning. Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don't @CAPS1 like it, that they can't @CAPS1 protect their children from the world forever; some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves. How would children and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual content on @CAPS1.V? If students never know, how will they live? Books can be learning in many ways. Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child. Maybe the family can't @CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books. If students can't @CAPS1 have access to them then what's the option for them? Everyone knows how today's society is changing; if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is appropriate. All libraries check out books so the book is under a name. I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out. If schools had books that are for only a certain age group, a solution to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be that the books are in a case that is locked up. So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked, they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get. Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by parents.
1094	4071	2	3	Censorship in libraries? In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with profanity. In my opinion that is just the author's way of how he or she wanted to do it. I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors and producers. That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heaps and heaps of books out there you can find that are not bad! If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of a sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family oriented and safe for children's eyes. So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of foul language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role model and teach them about healthier viewings.
1095	4072	2	3	Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indecent to read or not. We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What @MONTH1 look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong @MONTH1 be completely normal to the individual they are making the decision for. Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisions is one of the human race's greatest talents. These decisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that affect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom? When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. These ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books too? In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types of movies, books, etc. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment. I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions, and this right should never be taken away from us.
1096	4073	2	3	I do not believe that people should be given the right to remove books from library shelves simply because they find them offensive. Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us. Everyone has the personal choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not. If they do not want to, then they do not have to read it. Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either. Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it may be, they do not have to read it. I find a lot of people say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking. However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there. Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them. But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves entirely. Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book 'Speak', for example. In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly. But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience. She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help. This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through. Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them. Books are not the only things that might offend some people. In certain department stores, there may be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively. Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned? No, and why might that be? Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not. Another place is the internet. If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the internet then there are in books. Kids can get on the internet and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the internet? No, because the internet helps in a lot of ways too. If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library. Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics. I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer. Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it. So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained. Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from. Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out. After all, we are not forced to do anything. All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own.
1097	4074	2	3	Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive by certain groups or individuals. Books, movies, and music were created for a reason. It's a form of entertainment as well as a means to build knowledge and understanding. Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice; it is their fundamental freedom of speech. Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive. Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society and limits access to diverse perspectives. If all books on the Holocaust were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincarnated in the future. The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons about life and history. Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valuable or interesting information. People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing now in some communities. The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our own personal decision to make. It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves for everyone. If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benefit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material. Banning things from the public takes away opportunity for people to engage in things that interest them and stifles cultural and intellectual growth. Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a single controversial thought. The book 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' had multiple occurrences of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone. It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening. Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it. Katherine Paterson's quote is correct; if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us to read or learn from. Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material at all? There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone else. Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason. Not only is it for entertainment, but it is also for knowledge and the sharing of ideas too. Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice; it is their freedom of speech and a cornerstone of a free society.
1098	4075	2	3	Did your child ever bring home a book from the library? A piece of music, a movie, or a magazine? Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else? There are points in time where there isn't a clear answer to that question and you don't want to choose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading? Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The main point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf every time that someone doesn't think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see. In agreement to Katherine, parents naturally want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advanced to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world; its a big world and you cant just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isn't a way that you can stop it completely. I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that one child. Libraries can't just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that don't like this or don't like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective; they don't always know the difference between right and wrong in the same way. It's a bigger world out there than you and me. When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace and allow for a diversity of ideas and stories?
1099	4076	2	3	I don't think that censoring books and movies is needed in my opinion. Very many people are just too protective and overreact to content they find disagreeable. They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts of life. Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in their life. Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment. You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older and more mature. The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get their way at least in their own community. I think that libraries should be organized in a way that when you walk in you know the section you want to be in. They should have the books for adults in one section, books for teenagers in a different section, and books for kids in another section of the library too. This would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot and avoid inappropriate materials. This would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is and its intended audience. Another good thing that would help in a library are signs that categorize the books by genre. So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book, you just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are located. This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don't know how to search for their book in a library efficiently. The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too. They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be separated to where the signs in the section say movie and music. This way kids don't have to roam around to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it accidentally. The movies and magazines don't have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well known than books in our current time period. A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention. If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they might just wander into the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don't want them to see. The kids section could be lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors to naturally deter younger children. All of my ideas would work effectively and keep all of the kids entertained and in the appropriate areas. They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking into a vibrant and welcoming library. These are the only ideas that I have that would work well for organizing a library space. There could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit, but a clear and engaging structure is the most reliable solution.
1100	4077	2	3	To remove or not to remove, that is the question many people are asking. Should people be able to remove books that are offensive from library shelves? I think so; it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics that might contain objectionable material. To start off with, everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive, and what's not. Personally I don't think that we should remove books, because they're offensive; I think we should just not let that particular author publish anymore books if they are consistently problematic. But it's like I said, everyone has their own opinion on this matter, and that is why it is so difficult to reach a consensus. Secondly, it's entirely up to the library where to place certain books with blood and gore, and if to have them or not in their collection. Personally I like books with blood and gore; because it shows how the world actually is, with all its complexities and sometimes harsh realities. It's not like a fairy tale book where you always save the princess or damsel in distress; these stories can offer a different kind of truth. Lastly, if parents are concerned about offensive books, don't let your kids get those kind of books; give them a different, perhaps more boring book instead. I mean, we generally know the books that kids are not supposed to read but sometimes parents let kids read them anyway, so the responsibility ultimately lies with the parent. In conclusion, if you feel that a book is offensive, don't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone who will disagree with you and may want to read it.
1101	4078	2	3	I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advantages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. Why would many books be gone? If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person might find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that 'The Catcher in the Rye' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. How would we get as much knowledge as we have? Without all the books that are in our libraries how would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn how to do things. I myself have learned how to become a successful fantasy novel writer from the advice I took out of 'A Fantasy Writer's Guide for Beginners.' How would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries? Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be creative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books would be a dull and uninspired existence. Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropriate but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different part of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want censorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books, and ultimately recognize that the freedom to access diverse materials is a cornerstone of a knowledgeable and imaginative society.
1102	4079	2	3	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines in the world. Some are humorous, historic, or romantic, however some are offensive in some way. People might get offended when they read or listen to certain things, but does that mean that those things should be removed from the shelf? Some people might find something offensive while another person does not, therefore the music, books, movies, or magazines should not be removed from the shelves. If a person thinks that a song should be removed from the shelf and it does get removed, what about the person who did not find it offensive? People are entitled to their own thoughts and feelings, however that doesn't mean that one person's feelings are better than someone else's. If everyone tried to make everyone happy then there wouldn't be a lot of options to choose from in the library. If one person finds something offensive in a book, another person might find another book that is offensive, and it goes on until there aren't any books left, leaving the shelves barren. With entertainment it is hard to please everyone. No matter what it is there will always be at least one person who doesn't like it. This, however, does not mean that it should be removed from shelves. If one person does find it offensive then there is most likely someone else who doesn't. The people who don't find something offensive want to be satisfied, too. It is impossible to please everyone, so what should be done? If someone finds something offensive, they shouldn't read or listen to it. People can choose to quit listening to a song, quit watching a movie, or quit reading a book or magazine that they might find offensive. They have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it. This way the person who isn't offended can still enjoy their choices of entertainment at the library. If I find something offensive I try not to pay attention to it. There are many books or songs that I do find offensive, so I just avoid those. By avoiding these books or songs I don't offend anyone else by taking away something that they might enjoy. I still am satisfied and so are they. The library workers know what they are doing. If the library takes away a book because some people find it offensive then they might be offending those people who didn't find it offensive by basically saying that their morals are better than yours. A library should take a book or magazine out if it feels necessary, but not to please certain customers because then they aren't pleasing the other customers and could offend them. People have the right to voice their feelings but that doesn't mean that they are always right and that certain things should be changed because of them. It is impossible to make everyone completely satisfied but there are compromises. The libraries shouldn't remove things off their shelves but should give more options that won't be offensive, and people should avoid the things that they find offensive, thus creating a balanced environment for all patrons.
1103	4080	2	3	Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are books, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer. The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today. Another important reason why library censorship is wrong is that material that one person might find to be offensive might not be offensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of the community is achieved. Furthermore, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people might be able to look back on these events both now and in the future. In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrich the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material might be to them, ensuring that libraries remain a comprehensive repository of human thought and experience.
1104	4081	2	3	Do I believe that any book or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense? No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else. If the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion. In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' What she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material. If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everything they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the book or other form of material offends you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores. Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their books, novels, poems, etc. I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not have your children read it than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children; stay away from the book as much as possible. If you might come across it just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a car crash then reading a non-appropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores, as personal responsibility and choice should prevail over broad restrictions.
1105	4082	2	3	Dear sir or madam, Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive? Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, book or movie was removed from the shelves? Would removing every book, cd, movie or magazine from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language and other inappropriate things be helping the community? Do you believe that its everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves? I believe that a lot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them. I bet people all over the world have read offensive books. But the only types of people that those books, movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids. But at the time they wouldn't see it as offensive, they would think that it was cool and interesting and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it then they would gone back the library and get another one. I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves. Because if only that one book, movie or magazine was removed from the shelves then the person that got it removed would move on from that book, magazine or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive. If every person were to remove every book that they were to find offensive then other people who would enjoy that certain thing wouldn't be able to obtain it. If everyone were to find all kinds different books, movies or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves then there wouldn't be very much left for the community, defeating the library's purpose. In conclusion I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the community's choice. If someone wants a good book, magazine, or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get. If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get they should just choose what they think is interesting and ignore the offensive parts, thereby taking personal responsibility for their own and their family's reading choices.
1106	4083	2	3	Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive? If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there. I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone. If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it. In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. The potential for harm is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read. As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' This principle is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future. I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Ultimately, a balanced approach with clear guidelines is necessary to maintain a functional and responsible library collection.
1107	4084	2	3	Today in our day and age we have books, music, movies, and magazines that say or show materials that young children and teens should not be seeing at their ages. I am writting your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries. Their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that the parent has to sign before that says, 'my child can see or hear the materials being displayed.' In this centry we have television networks and popular streaming services showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. Its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to. There are shows on these platforms now showing teenage pregnencys, and they are pursading the viewers that its okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. Other shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no conserquence. Also they have violence and uneeded langauge. I know from my own experience watching a show my dad has came into my room, and told me to turn it off. That they shouldn't be allowed to do somethings they are showing the viewers. I know when I am married and have children I will keep my kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation. Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive. In my opition the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropraite for there age. Even books have sexual contact, and language. When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them. Magazines these days are even worse. The call the magazines 'gossip magazines' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at conveniate stores and are reading it. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring. I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation. I hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you for your time and for considering my perspective on this important matter.
1108	4085	2	3	I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive. Children shouldn't be allowed to read books that have inappropriate pictures on them. Censored material can have bad influences on children. Scary movies can make children have nightmares. There should be restrictions against offensive materials. Libraries contain plenty of books, music, movies, and magazines for everyone. Libraries also have some offensive items in them. Offensive material should be removed from libraries. Children don't need to see inappropriate material in libraries. Inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids. Censored material such as offensive language, smoking, and alchol are extremely bad influences on children. Children don't need to say cuss words. Smoking can lead to cancer or death. Alchol is also addicting and can cause a person to become violent. Children shouldn't be able to see these inappropriate items in libraries. Scary movies can give children nightmares. When I was a child, I saw a scary movie and I couldn't even sleep that night. Inappropriate movies need to have ratings so that kids don't watch them. Kids believe most of what they watch in movies. Movies should be restricted from children to watch them. There is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children. Bad influences can have a bad effect on children. I believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children to ensure a safe and positive environment for their development.
1109	4086	2	3	Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents reponsibility, not it's the library's. The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine, ect. Whether it's for enjoyment or research. That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read. If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in there oppion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library. Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow? If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book? Or even teach them that those books are wrong. The parents have full responsibiliy if their child is reading something that is inapropriate in their eyes. How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong. If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie they're picking out. Most libraries have a children's section anyway. It is not the library's responisbility to watch out for your child, it's the parents. Their job is to supply the community with books, movies, magazines, etc. Libraries should keep the books on the shelvles so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read without the interference of individual parental preferences.
1110	4087	2	3	Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive. People argue to get the corruptive books, magazines, movies off the shelves. The customers have the choice not to check out the material, it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf. People that go to the library have the choice to read the book or not, if they have heard bad reviews about the book then they can just ignore it. The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and its not to be taken off just because some people dont care for it. Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf. Everybody has different likeings and tastes when it comes to books. Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's. Beliefs and standards differ from person to person and that is why the likeing of books is different to most everybody. Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive. If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you dont want them reading then tell them that the book is innapropriate. The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back, that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed. Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library. Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read. When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you run across one you find innapropriate then ignore it and continue with your day, it's as simple as that and preserves access for all.
1111	4088	2	3	It was during my history class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher picked up, was 'The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home. I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive. There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason. Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression. People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge. A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material. Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. 'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time. It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. That example proves that material that's regarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what make a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library, and we would all be poorer for its loss.
1112	4089	2	3	I think it's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive. People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see it is, if the book offends you, then don't read it. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to simply not open it. It would be easier to find certain things if we had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. If we had a library for just music, it would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses. Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would simply put it back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf because one person might think it's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then it shouldn't be offensive. Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. If you find a book offensive just put it back on the shelf and leave it be. Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face it, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting it in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing album, it could be bad. That album could have everything about doing drugs on it, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs. I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, it's music, not books. I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. Books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, it's all a matter of opinion and personal choice.
1113	4090	2	3	I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you, people shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf. If it's their children they're worried about just teach them from staying away from adult section. Also, some people don't like foul language but that's their opinion. Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson). If it's your children your worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books. You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship. Before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child. Many people don't like foul language but, that's their opinion. It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting. Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing. Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story. Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left. This could effect peoples education and reading skills. Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson). It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong. Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read? Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better. I don't know what I would do if there was no more books. Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them. What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you? It is a question worth considering before supporting censorship.
1114	4091	2	3	Removing certain books, music, movies, magazines, and so on is a serious question to ask. Well, some believe its a good idea, on the other hand other people dont. If you ask my opinion I would have to side with not removing certain books, movies, music, etc. One of the many reasons why I believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion. Some might find a book offensive, well on the other hand some might find it riveting and not offensive at all. If the person thinks the book is offensive they should simply not read it. They should not have to band books, music, movies, etc. just because some find it offensive. Well others might find things offensive that the other person does not. We all have are own beliefs and we should be free to express them, as long as it doesnt involve breaking any laws. Another reason why I agree with not removing certain books, movies, and so on is because we might not have any left. Like I said before we all have our own opinions. Not every single person is going to say a book, etc. doesnt offend them. We should not have to take away certain items. But on the other hand I believe we should restrict certain books, movies, music, etc. If a book, movie, etc., seems to complicated for a child to comprehend, then they should not be able to read, watch, etc., the item. We should classify things based on knowledge, understanding, and maturity. Also I believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe. Just as we all have choices. I can agree with some of the arguments other people have for removing certain books, and movies, etc., but the main idea is to do what is best for everyone. I just dont see that removing every book, movie, music, etc., will solve any problems. In fact I truly believe it would make matters worse. Their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to. In conclusion I believe we should keep libraries the way they are. It would keep things less complicated and it would be the best choice for preserving freedom and diversity of thought.
1115	4092	2	3	A @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Is there ever a time where there is a movie that you wanted to see, but due to graphics in the movie you were not aloud to see it? Many parents or young adults believe that movies being @CAPS1 are a good thing. What they do not know is that if something is @CAPS1 that's just going to make the kid want to go see it more. First of all, if they kids want to see it badly enough they will just sneek in or get a copy of it off the internet, which is illegal. I remember when I was younger me and my friends always wanted to go see @CAPS4 rated movies. So we would have our parents drop us off. When we would arrive home are parents would ask what we saw, we would lie and say we saw the new @CAPS5 @CAPS6 movie. Therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing. Secondly if you don't believe your child should watch a movie because of your religious beliefs, then you and your child should have a talk. Statistics show that the more the kids can talk to their parents openly and come to an agreement, the less the child is going to lie and go behind their parents back. Many parents come to an agreement, that if they get to preview the movie first then they will decide if it is appropriate for their child to watch. In many cases this works out great for the parents and children, for if the adult gives permission for the child to go see it then the parent and child will have something to talk about when they get home. Finally, I believe movies should be uncensored. For the movies are not really that bad, your child will end up seeing it one way or another. Whether it's at a friends house the internet, or going to the theater. What harm could it cause to see it now. So in conclusion to my statements, to know that your child will see this movie, wouldn't it be okay not to censor it. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' as said by Katherine Paterson is true. Could you imagine living in a @CAPS1 world? I know I can't. So think are you for or against censorship. Would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw? I know I wouldn't, which is why I stand against censorship.
1116	4093	2	3	There are all kinds of different people in the world. People with different views on things, people with strong opinions, people who are very outspoken and mature and alot of those people are authors of the hundreds of books that fill our libraries at school. Some schools censor certain books from schools because they think the tone or message is inappropriate or too violent, but I believe that we have a right to these books. In my opinion no book should be censored from the library. We have troops fighting for our freedom of press and freedom of speech and censoring books completely ignores these wonderful freedoms our country has given us. During my freshman year we read a book called '@CAPS1 @NUM1' and before we read it our teacher told us a little bit about what it is about. She said the book was about the way a society had banned books like they were drugs or something that could hurt us. Now apparently a school didn't like the idea of a society banning all books so they banned this book from being read to their children. Now if you actually read this book they portray how bizzare and crazy this would be to have all books banned but here we are banning a book about banned books! Does this make any sense? To be honest by the time you are in high school you have probably seen, heard, and done crazier stuff than what people put in the 'banned books'. Now I know there are some people who would say just because you do things that you should not be doing in the first place does not mean you @CAPS2 to read about it all the time and fill your head with ideas about it, and I agree on some level because most of the stuff high schoolers do they shouldn't, but thats life, plain and simple. In my opinion, high schoolers really are mature enough to handel some offensive language or violent scenes because I'm sure they see worse stuff on the televison or sometimes in their own homes. One of my good friends is @NUM2 years old, has two jobs, her own apartment with her boyfriend, and is not supported by either of her parents. Now this girl still goes to high school and has great grades and is obviously very mature for her age but yet even she is not allowed to read a book with some offensive language in it. I think our society 'babies' us a little to much because when we get out into the real world things are not going to be censored or kept quiet. I think high schools @CAPS2 to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature. When we go into the work place after college and start our lives with careers, homes, and families we @MONTH1 be to immature to deal with it and I know some people who are! Censored books are just a way to keep the way we live life quiet to some people and never let kids grow up and experience things. We have a right to these books just like the people who write them have a right to do so. If they can publish them, then we should be able to read them no matter what our age is, as that is the very essence of the freedom we cherish.
1117	4094	2	3	Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? '@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple. Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about @NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad. Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language. Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening. Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents. Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time that is correct, about @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them. However, there is @PERCENT2 of children out there that will just think of the information that they are being told as good things. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't just wake up one day and say im going to bomb the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out. People @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them. Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago. Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen. Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened. Many young people @MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened. @CAPS1 why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children, so they can access them with proper guidance.
1118	4095	2	3	Reading is very important for kids these days. Libraries should have the right to have any kind of text, movie, magazine, or genre of music that is desired for a student to learn from. There are not any kind of books that could be deemed offensive in any way to people these days. There are exceptions to this however like any book written to specifically target a race, religion, or gender. Such as books written by raving racist fanatics like members of the @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1-@CAPS2's. Being a high school student and having a nice library in my school I have learned a lot from the books in my library. I have never in my @CAPS6 years of @CAPS4 seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them. I can assure you that there is not one book in the @CAPS7 that would offend me personally, this is not to say though that there are books out there that will offend certain people. Reading books is fun to me and I would not want to miss out on a good book because a library is not holding it because there is the off chance that someone somewhere might get offended by that certain book. Reading should not be limitted based on content because there is always someone out there who is looking for that certain book for a good read. I have heard of people who have gotten mad because there was a nude picture in an art book. Seriously? An art book? Art is what it is. Art has had naked people in it for thousands of years. Why should it start to offend people now when it didnt offend people then? People are just weird in this day in age i guess. There are certain movies that should most definately be removed from the shelves of libraries, such as porn for example. Porn should never, under no cercumstances be held in a library. There are special places for porn such as the internet. Music is a different story however. Music should not be taken out of libraries because there are some people who cannot affort to buy music for places like @LOCATION1, iTunes or @CAPS3. Music has so many genres that its is impossible to make out what should and shouldnt be in the library, and there are so many different types of people that listen to different types of music in the @CAPS7 and it would be wrong to tell that certain group of people that their music is too heavy or too rappy for the library. Listening to the music in the library is a different story however, you should definatly not be allowed to listen to your music in the library or at least not be allowed to have it loud enough for everyone else to hear it. I dont read magazines but i know enough about them to know that they should and shouldnt be allowed into a library. Magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@ORGANIZATION1' should definatly be allowed into a library because they are the hub of learning from magazines. However there are magazines that should not be allowed into a library like '@CAPS5' and other pornographic magazines as well as ones like '@CAPS6' which are magazines that target young girls to make them think that they should look perfect like the models in the pictures. Those are the types of magazines that make young girls dress skimpy and inapproprietly and make girls turn to throwing up to keep themselves skinny. There are definatly some things that should be kept out of the libraries but one book, or one movie, or one genre of music, or one kind of magazine should not keep them all out. One problem shouldnt make them all a problem. Libraries are a place where people go to escape, similar to things like @CAPS7 of @CAPS8 and other videogames. People should have the right to go to a labrary with the intent of getting something and they should be able to get what they came for, fostering a space of learning and personal discovery.
1119	4096	2	3	What is @CAPS1, @CAPS1 is whay made this country the who we are today! There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self. Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct. Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong. im just going to share a few prior exspereances. Now all of theas were from being in a libraries. Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city. There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country. Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie. It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman. So he put it down and walked out. Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car. About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section. Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off. Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean. There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber. As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time. Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing. They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc, to help navigate these complex issues of expression and acceptability.
1120	4097	2	3	@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they
1121	4098	2	3	I am writing this essay to persuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many past experiences and from my own observations within the library. I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children's section shelves of our libraries that is far too advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the children's section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material making up this section is far too advanced or is too profound for children to absorb, dealing with complex themes of adult life. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagination more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend, which only leads to confusion. Let's use put more fit books on the shelves of our library and quit wasting our money on unfit books that do not serve our children's needs. In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persuaded the readers to understand the point I am trying to make. I hope my readers take the information I have given and put it to work for the benefit of our community's youth.
1122	4099	2	3	Libraries are community centers for learning and discovery. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information, expanding their understanding of the world. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive to a few, then young adults and adults would never receive those new experiences and perspectives. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library that serves a diverse public. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well, setting a dangerous precedent. Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love, exploring different genres. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; furthermore, you cannot take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property, purchased for the community. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it and forming their own opinion. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts and their right to choose. Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example, might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring based on fear of controversy. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The effects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries and can impact creative expression everywhere. Music artists might also be affected in a similar way. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, Eminem, a famous rapper, curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people and expressing their art. Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing and why they write it. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings, capturing the human experience. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers; their work reflects life. If movies were all about unicorns and nothing else, the movie industry would fall apart quickly from a lack of substance. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work that form our cultural record.
1123	4100	2	3	I recently saw a movie rated R for language, violence and some nudity. This kind of movie shouldn't be on any kind of shelf where children can access it. It's too inappropriate for kids to see or even read what the movie case says, as the descriptions alone can be disturbing. There shouldn't be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures available for public checkout. It's bad for the kids to see or hear about because one day a little boy or girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble, mimicking what they have observed. It's just wrong to see other people naked if you ask me. The only person I want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years, in the context of a private relationship. But I don't want to watch a movie and see a lady nude; it makes me uncomfortable. The next thing is violence, which is a major problem in media. Man I just wish guns weren't invented or bombs, because of the pain they cause. I have lost a lot of friends to guns, and the violence I see in movies reminds me of that pain. I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit their area, so this is a personal issue for me. More and more people are going out and buying guns and bombs because of movies and what people say in books and in magazines that glorify them. People are getting names of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market, inspired by what they see. People get these ideas because of movies that show these things as exciting. Last but not least, language is the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. They learn it from movies mainly because the actor says the words and makes it seem cool. Now the kids know how to say them and use them without understanding the impact. Studies say that kids say and do what their favorite actor says and does on and off the air, copying behavior they see on screen. My conclusion says that all everything with violence should be taken off the shelves to protect our children and our community from harm.
1124	4101	2	3	Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, women's rights, religion, and many other things, reflecting social progress. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed and accepted as normal. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves and their own homes, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone else. Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech, protected by the constitution. This shows that even though someone might write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it by the government. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray, as that violates this fundamental principle. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban from public access. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to, and they trust my judgment. I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do with ratings, but they do not have the right to ban books entirely. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child directly says it is fine if his/her child may check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book, placing the decision with the family. The choice for what is appropriate for each child should be left up to their parents, not a library committee. If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books left on its shelves. In almost all books someone might be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else, as people have different sensitivities. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written, providing a historical record. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them in the future. For example, in the play A Doll's House it shows how the society's view of women was limited and restrictive. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how their purpose in life was to raise the children and that was it, with little else expected. They did not feel that women had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that, which we now know is false. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today and highlights the importance of equality. If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read, which is a form of control. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things to guide younger readers. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them without damaging our collective freedom.
1125	4102	2	3	I believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents learned in the past, gaining the same knowledge. Learning things through the same teachings, books, movies... etc. provides a consistent and honest education. Learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing, swearing and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away it's like lying about history, and what really happened, sanitizing the past. Should the children of today be deprived of the truth and given a false version of events? Would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was appropriate and non offensive, losing all historical accuracy? Think about it carefully... Were you deprived of learning real history when you were in school? I didn't think so, so why start now and change what has worked? Say your child is going to be reading 'Huckleberry Finn' in English class today. Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the 'n-word' and the word 'slave' out of the book, altering the author's original text? Depriving them of how there use to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments that were a part of that era? Depriving them of actual history and the context in which people lived? Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning appropriate and comfortable? No, I wouldn't do that to my children. I would want my children learning anything and everything about world history, the good and the bad, to become well-informed adults. I do not think that there should be censorship in libraries because it prevents this honest and complete education.
1126	4103	2	3	Libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages, offering resources that can educate and inspire. Some individuals argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf, but I beg to differ. A library holds many books, magazines, movies, etc. that can advance the knowledge of citizens and provide valuable context for understanding complex issues. Libraries can, and probably do, contain materials that are guilty of being offensive, but they shouldn't be taken off the shelf because of this. Instead, libraries should be divided into sections based on topics and maturity levels. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book based on racism, then the parent simply keeps the child out of that section, exercising their own judgment. How will children learn about what goes on in the world if they are not shown? Children won't know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early in a controlled manner. This doesn't mean that a child should be shown a magazine highlighting a celebrity's next drug scandal, but showing them that stuff like this does go on and you should not live that way can be a powerful lesson. Libraries don't contain material that is offensive without a reason; each item serves an educational or artistic purpose. What if a high school student is doing a report on the rise of teen-pregnancy? This student should have no better source for information than a library. The library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic, providing balanced and researched perspectives. These books that a library holds are not only there to educate us, but to entertain us as well, offering stories of human experience. If a library removes a biography on the rapper, a famous artist, because he has a 'rocky past', they risk losing one client who came to the library to be amazed by the struggles that many successful people have overcome to get where they are today. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' If a library censors all of the material that goes through the system, there may not be any books left to entertain ourselves or learn from. Therefore, libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf, but rather trust the public to choose wisely.
1127	4104	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries now a days, some are from many years ago, representing a vast collection of human thought. Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf, as access to information is a fundamental right. Books, music, movies and magazines are all made to interest people and reflect what they enjoy reading and experiencing. Authors and publishers should not be penalized for their hard work they achieved in creating these works. There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books, each with unique tastes. But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story; many appreciate the raw honesty. I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story, yet the core narrative remains compelling. I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book. Because I only enjoy reading about the romance and its various depictions. I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship, understanding it as part of the artistic expression. It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories, as it can diminish the author's intent. There may be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation, finding empathy through the narrative. Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life and share their important messages. Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in, fostering a love for literature. I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminated from the shelves in libraries, as it limits intellectual freedom.
1128	4105	2	3	Censorship, only for the light hearted, is a concept that limits exposure to reality. We have had this issue for as long as man can remember, a constant debate about information control. Since we were only little kids to adults, our access has been filtered. Everything was censored, from bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what a particular word spelt. I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, such as early childhood, but when that time goes on for too long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand and becomes restrictive. I am a high school student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just ridiculous. Its the most hypocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but that's okay because its in a science book, deemed educational. However if its in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop, which is an unfair double standard. I say its a library, let us read what we want to read and form our own opinions. Like I said before high school is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered, allowing for more complex material. Im not saying just completely take it away but come on now I think high school students can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book without being corrupted. As far as movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should of course be censored, as it lacks artistic merit, but if there's just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie with a valuable message. So the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us high schoolers for a few bad words, applying a reasonable standard. Censorship is for the lighthearted, and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just dont read it and let others decide for themselves. Thats all I have to say about censorship and its proper place in society.
1129	4106	2	3	Read, listen, and watch? These are fundamental activities we all engage in. Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them, created to convey stories and ideas. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, listen, and watch the things that let us do so, providing relaxation and enrichment. These things keeps us all occupied when there's a lot of time to spare, offering an escape or education. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and listen to music with no distractions or anything, a quiet haven for the mind, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library, requiring careful organization. People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it, which is part of the discovery process. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies, catering to diverse tastes. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching, which is a personal choice. Genre comes in all kind of different types, from fantasy to historical non-fiction. For example, there's only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only, ensuring age-appropriate content. There's also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision, as parents are responsible for monitoring their children's access. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand, leading to misunderstandings. All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library, clearly marked for adults. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else, maintaining order. Honestly all media actually should have their own section, organized by intended audience. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section, simplifying the selection process. All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read, trusting individual judgment. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection, more complex in nature. So books should stay where they belong and not taken down from any shelf, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media, preserving the integrity of the collection.
1130	4107	2	3	The libraries have to worry about enough as it is with people not returning books and stuff in, managing their collections and finances. They do not want to lose there books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find them offensive, as these items are valuable community assets. Why would we have to take something out that offends one person but no one else has complained about it being offensive, applying a majority rule seems unfair. I know that you are asking me to think like you to be able to see why it is offensive but I don't see how a book is going to be offensive in a way that necessitates its removal. When someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take it; they can simply choose another item. There are people out there who would read something that is offensive to them so that they can learn from it, gaining a new perspective. There is no reason why if you don't like the library that you can not go to a different one, or simply avoid certain sections. There is no reason for you to have to get so offended by books because the author is just trying to get their point across and expressing their feeling on the subject, which is a form of free speech. The way that I look at it is that you have two options. The first being deal with it and go to the library and get books you personally enjoy. The second is don't go to the library if you're going to be able to find something offensive there. But know if you pick the second one then you must realize wherever you go you are going to find some thing that will make you feel offensive so you might as well just get over it and say yes I will go because its all around me in the wider world. Yes I know what you must be thinking why if its not a big deal then why don't you just take them out. Well you want an answer and I will give you one. Those books maybe you don't want to read them, and that is your right. But what if someone else does? It's not fair to get rid of something just because a few people find it offensive now is it? That would be catering to a vocal minority. Therefore I say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything else out of the libraries. You will just have to deal with what you don't want in here; its not like we're going to make you read something that you take offensive to. We will not going to get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has, as they serve the entire community. That is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library, available for all who seek knowledge and entertainment.
1131	4108	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple. For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing. Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then. With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about. But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence? By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development. However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book, that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate. Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust. A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice. Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work. Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society. Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended. Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race. Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination. Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is. Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content. In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'. By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature. @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature. All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret. Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature? A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message. A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person. If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests. The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group. Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate. Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them. Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes. And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself. Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent. -@ORGANIZATION2.
1132	4109	2	3	There are many different perspetives on censorship in our country. This is the human race, opinionative that is. Different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children. In libraries there are some reading materials, that some @MONTH1 find offensive. Offensive material in libraries is @CAPS1 directed to be read by young children. They are also @CAPS1 inteded to be able to get there hands on such material. Even though this is @CAPS1 the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it. No the material is @CAPS1 held under lock and key, but it is also @CAPS1 left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them. The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books. The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories. If we protected children from censhorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library. @CAPS1 all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be. Some material @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be appropriate for children, but they also are @CAPS1 all inappropriate. A rated '@NUM1' movie @MONTH1 be just like a rated '@CAPS2' movie only with one extra reference, that @MONTH1 be taken in the wrong way. Even protective parents @MONTH1 allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate. Libraries should @CAPS1 remove this material from their shelves. If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library. There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children. All of which do @CAPS1 have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves. Censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject. There is a very good arguement on either side of whether or @CAPS1 to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries. I believe it should @CAPS1 be taken off and there are alternatives to this. This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone.
1133	4110	2	3	@STATE1 @NUM1, @PERSON1, IN @CAPS1 Katherine Paterson, I read your article in newspaper yesterday about offensive books in library. I agree with you on this article. Some of the books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me but they can be normal to other people.There can also be somw books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people. Everyone have their own views and ideas on everything.The people of @LOCATION1 have freedom of speech so it is true that every mouth has got something differrent to say. There are some books or movies that children can not read or watch but children still do because once the child is in library he can read,watch, or listen to anything. You can not depend on librarian because there are other people in the library too.The librarian probably have other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making library card or helping someone find a book. In my point of view, library should have diferent sections for different kinds of movies,books, or magazines and there should be person assigned for every section. This way children would not be able to go to older people's section. If there are books that are found offensive by everyone, then people should write a letter to president to help remove those books from library.Yours @NUM2.
1134	4111	2	3	Have you ever been in that situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it? Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it's not to your avalible because of its content? I know I always amd because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often. I believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offense. Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vaulger because not everyone might dislike the book. If we took a book off the shelf everytime someone reported a bad word or a discrimitive remark then we would be left with no books including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history. Some authors, movie directors and artist rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, comentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of loosing alot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As im sure you know alot of history books about the holucaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through; therefore those words shouldn't be reported for histories sake. I know im not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, ' ... If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same righ and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). In this quote she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read becasue someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happening if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries. Now don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together becasue I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that use profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn't be availible to the public through a library. Also if there are inappropriate movies I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public becasue thats what movies rental stores are for. On the other hand I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being takin away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1' also known as self opinions? In this writing my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there is some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but alot of it has a reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in innapropriate movies and songs with no hisrtoric purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?
1135	4112	2	3	I think that it is should be left alone the way it is because it put that way for a reason. They might not know the reason so thats why i think it should because the person might get mad if you mess it up just cause you dont like it the way it is because it is offensive to some people. Other reasons is because people are gonna home and watch it online or on tv so how is it gonna make a difference. It is not goiing to make one difference at all. Therefore, the material should remain as it is, since removing it from the library would not change what people can access elsewhere.
1136	4113	2	3	No, I believe all materials should be on the shelves at libraries. Because some people like stuff other people might find offensive. But you as parents should control what your kids are reading. If you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book, a new CD, a new movie, or a new magazine. If you don't, it's not their fault it's your fault. Some people like stuff that others don't. Such as, stuff from another culture or maybe something from a different religion. But we can choose to read whatever we want to. If you don't like it find something else but, some people find it interesting. Not everyone has the same views on stuff. If there are books just for adults put it in another room where minors can't get in. Make it to where you have to show an ID that says you are eighteen or older to get in. Then you can look at inappropriate books without having to risk kids seeing them. Then in order to check them out if you're under the age of eighteen a parent or guardian has to be with you if you want to get it. If it's a CD or musician that has cussing in it you need to be eighteen or older or have a parent check it out for you. Because some parents don't let their kids listen to bad music. Like I said in previous paragraphs I believe that they shouldn't take stuff off the shelves that a few or some people might find inappropriate. Because a few of us might find it interesting to know that this world isn't all the same. People are different and like different things, and a library should reflect that diversity.
1137	4114	2	3	Everyone in the world has different opinions. Some people care about things that other people don't care about at all. One topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship. Everyone has an opinion on it; and not everyone agrees with each other. All libraries have different sections based upon age. There are children's sections, teens sections, and adult sections. I think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels. Things in books and movies that aren't appropriate for children, shouldn't be put in the children section. I understand parents' don't want their children reading or watching obscene material; but as kids are growing up, they're going to learn about the inappropriate things sooner or later in school. I don't think anything should be taken off of a shelf just because a handful of parents find the material offensive. I don't take censorship very seriously. Some parents want their children reading books with inappropriate material so they can learn about what goes on in the world and what life is like. Most children and some teens don't know what the world is like because they don't get out much. They don't learn things that they should know already. Reading is a way of learning. When someone wants to know more information about any place or anything, they go to the library and check out a book. For a school project or just for fun. Most parents agree that nothing inappropriate should be in a childrens' section at a library. Just because they're young and parents don't want their kids going around at the age of ten cussing like a sailor. But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch inappropriate material like a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes. Parents shouldn't have a say on what goes on or off the shelves in a library. They should just mind their own business. If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive for them to read, then they can just simply tell them that they cannot get the book. It's as simple as that. Parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much. Censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me. I think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read. At least they're wanting to read. Let them read for heaven's sake. But like I said, everyone has their own opinions, and that is perfectly fine.
1138	4115	2	3	I am writing this essay to you to tell you that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be on our library shelves. Because if our kids pick them up there will be conflict, and crime. Some people might ask how do I know this; well say you see this CD case that says black man's only CD. And a white boy picks it up, well then a black kid sees it and that white boy's hand the black guy will try to rip it out of his hand. Therefore starting a fight. This kind of material promotes division and anger between different groups of people. It is better to keep such provocative items away from public spaces where children and families gather. We must protect our community from potential harm and ensure the library remains a safe and peaceful place for everyone to learn and enjoy. Allowing these things to be available only leads to trouble and sets a bad example for the younger generation.
1139	4116	2	3	What should and should not be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to remove what they didn't like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less accessible to the general public. Although some people might be offended by some forms of literature, this doesn't mean that the literature should be removed from everyone. I believe a solution must be made to satisfy everyone. Currently, some people aren't happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries. They believe that the information might be unsuitable for some viewers. Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children. While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries; there are others who disagree with the thought of censoring our libraries. By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public. If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking what's behind the cover, then the parents have no one to blame but themselves. I believe that this could all be resolved by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be put with the serial number of the library card. If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book. I can see how censorship is very useful and important. Although sometimes it can be taken a bit to the extreme. There is a solution out there, but we just need to find it and implement it fairly for all parties involved.
1140	4117	2	3	In the library I have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group. Such as rated R movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of seventeen rent out a rated R movie. Another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisements and pictures that are more towards the sexual side. This is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older. Most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children. The sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section may not be suitable for teens and children. Then if you're in a children's section you know that not many over the age of twelve will be wanting to look around for books. In the children's section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love. This helps the children stay there and not wander off into one of the adult or teen sections. When I was younger I didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause I enjoyed reading 'The Cat in the Hat', 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', and many other children books there. Children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like 'Sesame Street'. They also have an unlimited amount of books that can keep them entertained. If movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries I've been to have toys). The only real big problem with having things inappropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section. Again with the movies, there are tv shows that I've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk. Things like that I think put a bad influence on younger teens. Making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool. Over all I think that libraries just need to reorganize their books, movies, and magazines. Then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidentally picks up something that is inappropriate for their age group. The music in the library I don't think is much of a problem. To me music is something more to express your feelings. This is my view on censorship in libraries, and I believe better organization is the key.
1141	4118	2	3	There are many books out there that, if looked into, have something obscene or vulgar in them. Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things, the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries. Authors write or type every word for a reason, whether happy or sad or vulgar. There is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive' things. Everything you read in a book is there because the author wanted you to read it, not to just put it in to fill in space or to be nasty. I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean we should take the books down. The library where I live has sections for children, teens, and adults so that there is no confusion or concern of the content of the book. You have to be of age in order to take some of the readings home. I personally think that this is a great idea and will compromise both sides that don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything. If the latter was taken into effect though, some of the classic and prize winning books would be taken off the shelves, such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, and much more. Such harsh actions aren't necessary when a much simpler and more effective way can be accomplished. Although offensive material is a concern for children, there are much better ways to have it so they can't read them until they are ready. No book should be taken off a shelf for its content, as this would limit access to important and celebrated literature for everyone else.
1142	4119	2	3	I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because someone finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are. I feel this way because no one is forcing anyone to watch or read anything they don't want to. No one is telling students what they can and can't watch or read. Every one has the choice to choose what they want to read or watch. What one person finds offensive and wrong, another person may find interesting and exciting. I have felt the same way before about certain materials, but that still gives me no reason to take it off the shelf. The next person after me has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have and to like or hate whatever is on the shelves. There are lots of things in a library other than things that people find offensive. There are scary books like Stephen King's 'The Shining', a New York Times best selling author. There are mystery books like 'The Da Vinci Code', another New York Times best selling author, Dan Brown. So to sum up my essay, nothing should be taken off library shelves just because I or anyone else finds them offensive, as this would infringe upon the rights and choices of others.
1143	4120	2	3	I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be available to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes, there are some very offensive items in a library, such as a book about racism to African Americans. However, that person who takes offense in those items does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and everybody. Let's suppose you have a young child, and you take him or her to the public library with you. As you're looking for a book, the child reaches to the highest book that he or she can reach, pulls it off the shelf, and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right in front of your child. That is your own fault for not supervising your child, not the library's. Although many times it's not the library's fault where certain books are at, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking. I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification, and sign a waiver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offense to anybody in which the customer is around. This system would allow for access while maintaining responsibility, and that is my view on this subject.
1144	4121	2	3	Books being taken off the shelves? No way! The library is the place to go if you want books, movies, music, etc., that fit what you like and want. Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else? No, because libraries are meant for everyone for a reason. Everybody is different, which means everyone comes to the library for different types of information. If the libraries took off all material that offended people, there would be nothing left. What offends someone may not offend someone else. For example, the libraries have information on the Civil War history. While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learning about it, the information is also offending some people who it talks about. But really if you think about it, it's all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about. It would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to. When people go to the library they know, no matter what information they're looking for, they will find it. Isn't that what's so great about trips to the library? Looking and finding things you never learned about, even if it offends others. All that matters is that your head is holding more knowledge about that certain subject. It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are meant for everyone for a reason, and censorship undermines their fundamental purpose.
1145	4122	2	3	Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on what's offensive and what isn't; like some people will find something funny that some people may think is nasty or inappropriate. If you were to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive, there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has their own opinion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but that is the parent's decision to monitor their child, not everyone has the same view on the material. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves because of one person's opinion on it. Everyone has their own opinion; some people like what other people don't, everyone is different in their own way. Therefore, the diversity of materials should be preserved to cater to the varied tastes and needs of the entire community, rather than being limited by individual sensibilities.
1146	4123	2	3	I firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, etc., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem. A person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they can not just remove them. To remove books, music, movies, etc., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos and dissatisfaction among other patrons. As Katherine Paterson stated 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to choose books, music, movies, etc., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library the statement would probably be true. Besides the point the library is sectioned off into different genres, so if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer. In other words, the things that may offend one person may not offend another person. So to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject. So instead of there being a problem with one person there would a problem with two unsatisfied people. Not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as, separating the books for reasons like this. According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a section for children only. Therefore worries of problem like this have already been solved. The books, music, movies, etc., in the childrens section is age apprioate for a child. Books, music, movies, etc., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults, ensuring content is generally suitable for those age groups. In conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, etc., that are found offensive by others may not be found offensive by someone else. It is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, etc., on the shelfs. If you are mature enough to understand that and over look something that might offend you, you would not be so offended. Also if the library is sectioned off into different genre, you can easly by pass a particular genre you wish to avoid. Problems can be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner, such as utilizing the existing organizational systems rather than resorting to removal.
1147	4124	2	3	I dont think so becuase what if that is all the person likes to read. Removing a book could deprive someone of their favorite author or genre. They could put all the bookes in to diffrent sections so that littel kids wont be learning words they shouldnt know wright now. the librarian could also make it where you have to be a sertaint age to cheak out a book, providing another layer of protection. There are a bunch of ways to orginze them in to sectoins like make a kids section, a teenager section, and even an adult section. But i dont think the should take the out of the libary for good, becuse there are a lot of good books with some bad words in them. just becuase ther are some bad words in abook does not mean the book is bad or lacks valuable themes and stories. The overall literary merit should be considered before any removal.
1148	4125	2	3	Keep it on the Shelf! What types of things do you go to the library for? Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regaurdless of the material. Books can be used for many things. Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropiate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages. Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or modivate you to get your day started. Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store. Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. Magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert receipes. Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world everyday. Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. Without the magizines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world. You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. The library has educational movies for children that may not be available anywhere else. They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today, preserving important cinematic history. Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Without out most of that, regaurdless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. All of theses resources should stay on the shelves regaurdless of their material to ensure access and preserve our collective culture.
1149	4126	2	3	Can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored? Can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them? I think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt. To keep something as important as written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind. Not only would this attempt be a futile (for the people know ways to extract information) it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so. I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow. Not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to. If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child. Some might say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but I say that this is not so. I believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work. If every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensve only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none. There has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally. The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will. People find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party. I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi? Created and controlled by the government surrounding him. Made their slave through ignorance. If in a society I cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization. In short I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents. If a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it may be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely NO right to say what I may or may not read! If this offends anyone, then I apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep.
1150	4127	2	3	Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people? This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another. For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place. In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves. First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age. For, example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anyhting to do with them. Although, for the younger people, thet is what is new and 'cool' to do. I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids. We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part. I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today. Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beleifs. A big thing with this is race and culture. I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race. This the the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials. Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion. There are countless numbers of these materials just theat I have seen and I am sure that there are many more. It would be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves, but an effort should still be made. Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive. I have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive. The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it. A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes. I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive with a clear warning label. All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves. We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do. Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone. In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves to create a more respectful and harmonious community space.
1151	4128	2	3	Have you ever come across offensive material inside a library? Well, some people have and they think there should be some type of censorship in libraries to protect the offended people. I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express themselves through art, literature, and even music. After all, the freedom of speech is written in our rights. Many authors, artists, and musicians have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work, a form of self expression. They do not publish their work to offend people; they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are. A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library. Over many years most libraries have developed and arranged their media into a system called the Dewey Decimal System. This system separates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres. For instance, if you are looking for a mystery book, you would find it in the fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor. Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If every time that happened there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library. In the end a book is a book, music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books off the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write, musicians play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything it does not matter what is offensive to people; they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library.
1152	4129	2	3	'Everyone has different opinions' It is true that everyone has their own opinions and their likes and dislikes. For example, books. I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. It is true that finding an inappropriate book or an article might be disturbing to certain people, but it does not mean that everyone finds it offensive. Once, my English class was assigned to do a book project. The main purpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. One of my classmates read and had a brief presentation over a book that was about illegal drugs. I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alcohol', but I find these words to be obnoxious. While I found it disturbing and uncomfortable, others found it interesting. It was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me. Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. My friend, sitting beside me, found it disturbing to look at some pictures because they showed blood. Strangely, I never thought blood as anything disturbing. While she found it disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because it was fascinating. I always thought how the human body works is incredible. What she did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wandered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. The book did not have any benefit to her, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper. I believe it is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. Every individual is different in their own way. As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about it. If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarantee that there would not be any material left on the shelves. I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource.
1153	4130	2	3	I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpful place. Who would want to sit back and watch a racist movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develop a lot of problems. Music can be straight offensive. If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is racist, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an effect on you. You might not realize that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a different race. If a person isn't racist and they see something that is, it could offend them. They might feel like they are 'cool'. They go out and say racist things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technically bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries. Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie. They may not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They might go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These movies can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it. In magazines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magazines. If you see a model in a magazine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jealous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We might starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. In today's society, people strive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stare. We use the girls in the magazine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magazines can be offensive. In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head every time you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realize that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just being a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band Blood on the Dance Floor. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, 'I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. There is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut themselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries. We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is meant to be a good place. Anyone can go there. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.
1154	4131	2	3	Would you censor the Bible? I sure would not. The Bible is a very precious and religious part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousands of books, newspapers, articles, and media that play an important role in the history and the future of human beings. Common sense or also referred as common knowledge is something that we don't pick up out of nowhere. We absorb it through things we do, see, and read. An example is 'The Giving Tree'. This is a book of a tree that meets a young boy and the tree is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy. Throughout the story the tree gives the boy its apple, its branches, and even its trunk, but the tree is happy. At the very end of the story the former young boy is now an old man that just wants a place to rest so the tree straightens up his stump and is just happy with giving the old man his happiness. Now would you censor that?! That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life. That giving someone else happiness is the true gift of life. Now religion is something that is censored a lot these days... Why?! The Bible for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together. Individually the stories are just little reminders of right and wrong, kindness and jealousy. It doesn't say you have to follow every word and every sentence by day and night. It's just helpful advice, and really who has not asked someone else for advice? Censoring religion on tv, in schools, and everywhere else is telling us we don't need religion for us to be productive and honest. Me coming from a Roman Catholic and Christian background have never really went to church or read the Bible and am swelled up about religion. Thanks to a close friend. Censoring could also be good at its points though. For an example censoring adult type content from minors is helpful since little kids don't know much of anything. They just go with the flow. Another example is censoring mail sent to different countries. This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war. So I will say that censoring can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad. Such as censoring religious content, or censoring classical books that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future. This stuff is something that should be preserved by ages and ages to come!
1155	4132	2	3	Shut down libraries? Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnecessary attire, they could also contain potty mouth language. The words could, and can, corrupt the minds of youngsters. All libraries put them there because of the needs of customers. The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me? They should create separate libraries for each type of reader. Still, they put all of these things in the same building. They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'. I think I'll write my own book series, thank you very much. However, because some have dull environments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down. Make use of that thought I just told you. I wonder if there are some books on endangered species of fish. But some kid's series are dying because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories. If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life. What chick-cursing out loud in front of the baby. How about saying 'please pass that?..' or 'please throw that ball, you meanie!'? Maybe THAT will give some education. However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language. Those delinquents don't care about their minds at all. Your honor, I have my proof right here. I suggest reeducating those teenage delinquents to acting more appropriately.
1156	4133	2	3	With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created. This may be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People use libraries as a source to see these works. Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun. My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine on any subject that interests them. If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library left. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain may offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you may not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes with informing. You might think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone. I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public. If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated 'MATURE' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy. With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you may like a book, I might find it offensive. Even though I may have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear. This is how a library serves a community effectively.
1157	4134	2	3	As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple varieties of books can be found at a local library from documentaries to science-fiction or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one can choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposes the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some may disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary measure that constricts the ability to gain knowledge. In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people should be able to enjoy their differences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dislikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it should be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents. Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inappropriate, is an inexcusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's beliefs. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society. There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that people agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraries should be considered, but not at the expense of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored to the point of becoming empty.
1158	4135	2	3	I believe that this idea is not a good idea because some of the students would need that information to look up ideas that they would need to write about in a report or to write in a final. The reason the library is here for the students to have and take advantage of is to put time in to looking up what they need for their classes. Knowing me, I put the time that I need to do my work in class so I know what is needed in the report so I know I'm doing it right and not just making up something that I could just stick in the report. I see that it is important to keep the materials in the library to have the convenience to have things that are needed to look up a celebrity that is important to keep in touch with. If you're writing in the newspaper you are needed to the information that you can get your hands on to keep all the students informed in how their celebrity is living their life. If students are ready to graduate and they are needing to go on line to look up type of colleges that they could attend before leaving high school so they could be prepared to be ready in the world they were set out to be living in to start a life and accomplish things that our parents didn't get to do. The interest of the library is to inspire some of the readers in the class to go out and read books that can show the situation on how your health benefits are by looking in the cancer book for information from how the sun and going to the tanning bed can cause skin cancer and can hurt your skin just by making yourself look older by getting a tanner. I think the situation of the library is to be used for our education and our benefits to learn more from books and reading it is a lot more interesting than just watching a show or a rerun of a tv show or even movies that show all the action in a movie that you can get from a book with more details and deeper understanding.
1159	4136	2	3	It really don't matter to me because I only go to the library to get a book when my teacher at school makes me. But a library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is divided up in sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If a person don't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library then they don't have to look at it, or check it out. Just because one person don't like it don't mean someone else doesn't. Libraries don't make people look at or check out something they don't like, so why are people complaining about it. They are getting to checkout books, movies, and music for free unless it becomes over due. So people stop complaining about what the library has on their shelves and just enjoy the free access to information and entertainment that is offered to everyone in the community.
1160	4137	2	3	In the modern world today, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information. All of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. But what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? What if some of this information changed the perspective of peoples' lives, and who people are? Libraries do contain offensive and provocative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings. Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the world come from many different places making the world very diverse. One thing in a book may not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. Magazines, movies, books, etc. should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain ages whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgeable assistance to help what people are looking for. Sections in libraries organizes the library providing an easier access to where things are located. In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's ages is that it separates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one. Children normally have a separate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from. An example of a bad situation would be if there was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. The children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking. This is common sense. Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well. Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that there are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. Assistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it. Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. Every time I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for. They warn me about offensive or provocative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect. Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgeable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc. Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provocative. Everyone in the world has the right to read whatever they please. Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out of peoples' mouths are useful no matter how ridiculous it is. Even if it is the most ridiculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. This would be more on opinion based writing. In factual writing, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true. This brings me to my perspective on the matter that I think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books if we removed everything someone disliked.
1161	4138	2	3	What would you say if your library was censored? Would you believe it would be right to have a censorship at the library? Well I am here to explain my belief's on censorship in the library. My opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we dont want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. If i was an adult I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc. but i wouldn't want to block his whole life. There can be different censorship on individual people too. An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card, perhaps by restricting access to specific genres or content ratings. The censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching. A good suggestion for this is what i just brought up, a personal censorship. This would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents. Also for the rated x magazines, movies, etc. i believe they shouldn't be took off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded, like a separate room or a section for adults only. This can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area. The censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too. Alot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf. Just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too. You may please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action. Another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. The libraries are organized into section by categories of books. Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for, such as the children's section or the young adult section. Once you get into the actual novels it isnt much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. When you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not. With all this being said, there really doesnt need much censorship in libraries. Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library.
1162	4139	2	3	Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source. Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television. Media is used to inform citizens of occuring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, langauge, and etc. that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive. In the United States, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials, making a universal standard impossible. Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things. Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of a political leader, have to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events. Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the United States and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold.
1163	4140	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that old, damaged, or outdated materials should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up. I'm a teenager. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things, and you need to make space for new arrivals. And its something that would have to be done. Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do, like librarians during inventory. It is not my thing. I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others, and I think that applies to how we treat shared resources like library shelves as well.
1164	4141	2	3	Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive? I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensice. However, if a library decides to remove every piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare. I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels, pictures in magazines, and song lyrics. I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offeneded a piece of literature or art has made them. But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone might find offensive, another person could find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others. Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right. There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library. Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone. I know that I've personally found some books on the history of war to be disturbing because of how graffic they are. However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive. Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intened emotions, and make people think. You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you. With everthing going on in our society and culure today, in the United States and around the world, someone is bound to be offened everyday by something. Religious groups might be offened by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and politcal leaders may be offended by what journalists are writing about them. You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people. To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence. People are obviously getting offened by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it. The television shows are still being aired. Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offenseive. If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left? My friends, the answer is nothing. A beautiful creation to you might bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots may teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life. I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it. As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them.
1165	4142	2	3	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves, sharing their unique perspectives and experiences. I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying, finding meaning and connection in the words. I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape from stress or routine. Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling, offering a deeper and more complete story. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is, as tastes vary widely. So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well, available for all to choose from according to their own preferences?
1166	4143	2	3	As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines etc., should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers and preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for high schoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truly offensive they shouldn't allow them to be published, but this power should be used very cautiously. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books and music because they believe they are offensive, there would soon be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to. I believe that high schoolers and older should be able to decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you don't like a certain type of music, don't listen to it; if you don't like the way a book is written, don't read it. No one is making you read or listen to something that you don't want to. Books that may be offensive to some may be eye-opening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I find gruesome and unnecessary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life. I do believe that younger children should be censored from books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enough to know what is right or wrong, and they don't know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensive to parents with younger children and in the younger sections of libraries, while leaving the general collection intact for older patrons to make their own informed choices.
1167	4144	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library. Libraries are meant to provide people with the varieties of media that they need. This action will pose three things: business loss, inconvenience, and a narrowing of people's book selections. The first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business. Just like any other industry, libraries need people to use their multimedia materials, such as books, magazines, music, etc., so they stay in business. The purpose many people go to the library is to get certain magazines, or movies, and so forth, and to get rid of certain movies and magazines is getting rid of certain customers. Another reason is the loss of business will lead to loss in customers, and if there are no customers to check out multimedia materials, the library will be closed down. No one wants their library to be closed, so libraries should not be censored. Also, parents, instead of having an entire library censored, can censor what children get from libraries. One way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children. For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to check-out a movie that is rated R they would not be able to. The restriction on their card could be to rated PG, or G movies. Another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library. For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to get R movies, only allow them to get like one at a time. This will lower the risk of offending a parent or guardian. Finally, there would be nothing left in the libraries. One reason is that out of all the books in the library, I'm sure at least one person is offended by each one. Does this mean that every library should close its doors? No, of course not, this just means that if something offends someone from their local library, stay away from it. Don't check out that book, movie, magazine, etc. A second reason is do not go to that library if the material in it is offensive to people's beliefs or religion. Libraries offer many things to help people in enriching their knowledge about a certain belief, so they should not be censored. Sometimes what is considered offensive to one person, is essential to another. In every book of every library there is something that people most likely think should be censored. But they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously. Those same books transform lives, and are read to improve their understanding of something. So never will I think that the library should be censored, as it is a cornerstone of a free and informed society.
1168	4145	2	3	Freedom to choose is something every person can have, such as what type of clothes you wear. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to choose. Plus, there are other ways to avoid children getting inappropriate books besides taking the books completely out of the library. Censorship in libraries should not happen because if someone is eighteen, they should have the right to choose what they want to watch anyways, the parents can censor what books and movies they want their kids to read and see, and there are offensive things and inappropriate things on television that everyone has access to as well. First of all, if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they choose because they are grown adults. Eighteen year olds can go into rated R movies which would be about as bad as a book most likely. In our society, people that are eighteen can do almost whatever they choose because they have freedom. For example, adults can look up whatever they choose on the internet, and so can everyone else of all ages. So, if they wanted to read a book like that, they could probably get it off the internet, even if they can not in libraries. Therefore with today's technologies, censorship would not make a meaningful difference. Next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely. For instance, if parents are so worried about their children reading inappropriate books, then they should take their kids to the library themselves and tell their kid what they can and can not read. If parents do not censor what their child reads, then those parents may want the child to read whatever he/she chooses to. If their parents choose to let their kid read the book, then that is their choice, not anybody else's. The choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child. Lastly, there are so many things in the world that could be offensive to other people besides a book. For example, people offend other people all the time by words they say. People hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said. Also there is the television. The television has inappropriate shows on it all the time, yet everyone can have access to it if they choose to. Plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism, or someone being overweight. These things offend people every day. Therefore, we should not take books off the shelves just because there is a possibility of offending someone, when a person could be offended by so many other things in the world rather than a book. In conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies of the library should not be taken off the shelves away from the public just because they are not appropriate for some children. Eighteen year olds are adults who should be able to choose whatever they want. Plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books, then they can monitor that themselves. Also, people are offended every day by other people, so books, magazines, and movies are not the only things in the world that could be offensive. If the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them, then do not check it out! Not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone, so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice.
1169	4146	2	3	These days there are many kinds of media in the libraries beside books. There are music, movies, magazines and many more. There are all kind of things and resources that you can find from libraries. Do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? What do you think? I think it shouldn't be removed. Even if it is stuff that you don't want children to know, they will know someday. Once we remove it from the shelves then more things, the information is going to be removed. After all, nothing is going to be left. There is a lot of information in this world. Growing children learn all kind of stuff from parents, books and from other media. Parents want to let their children to learn as much as possible. However there are certain things that parents don't want the children to learn. You need to think this way. That children will grow up and become adults, then they will know anyway. Why would you remove it from the shelves, if they are going to know about it some how? What is the point about it? Doesn't removing from the shelves help children to not know about it? I don't think there is a point to do that. Katherine Paterson, the Author, said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. I agree with Katherine. Once the books or other media get removed because of some reason, other things are going to be removed because of other reasons. I don't think it should be removed, like Katherine said there is nothing gonna left for the children. If nothing is gonna left for the children what is the main point of having libraries? I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, magazines and many more, should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, because children will know and need to know to be adults. Also there is nothing gonna left for the children in the libraries if we remove everything that someone finds objectionable.
1170	4147	2	3	Should certain materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people. Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbing or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing. I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelf. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposely put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy themselves in whatever it is that they might be doing. Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelf just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things should be, and a library should reflect that diversity of thought and experience for the benefit of the entire community.
1171	4148	2	3	The thought that Katherine Paterson had in her quote is quite understandable. If we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries, as you could find something offensive in every book if you tried hard enough. I somewhat agree with her; however, I do believe there should be rules on where books are located. Books are meant to be read and taking them away would be horrible for every book-loving person in this world. There are some things about where the books are to be found in the library that is up for debate. Personally, I believe the children's books should be on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material. In doing this you, for the most part, prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate. Teenage reading material should be separate from both children's books and adult reading material. In this way they are not around the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak. If this were done parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being. They would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive. Books that some people find offensive should be categorized, such as 'Mature Content' or 'Explicit Material'. They should also be categorized as 'Young Adult', 'Adult', or 'Other'. In doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening. Although there will be times where people will still find those books, and may be offended, it is mandatory that we do our best to limit those times. All necessary precautions should be taken. At the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some. In removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece of history or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself. Books offer us as humans so much, from knowledge to entertainment to even a form of comfort. Books are important to everyone whether they realize it or not. We have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race through books. I do support Katherine Paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the purpose of having them around. At the same time I believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something. Removing books would destroy countless years of history, past thoughts, and past experiences. Books should never be removed from libraries just because they may be found inappropriate.
1172	4149	2	3	I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people get a learning experience off of then what does that leave us with? Everybody in life should have their own choices; we shouldn't limit them. It's all about making choices in life; people should get the right to read the books, magazines, etc. they want, without people looking down on them or thinking the material they receive is unnatural. What one person may think is not a good read, the next person might think the total opposite. Music is a creative aspect in our world; every person you meet is not the same so why should music be? You can't have the same ideas when it comes to making your creative looks on the music in your community; it's not going to turn out the same as everyone else's will. If that was the case then the world would be one boring place to live in. I think that every one has their own taste in music. If you're the right age and you're not hurting anybody, then what's the big problem listening to the music that encourages you to become creative? There are a lot of movies that some parents might think that they are not good for their kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more about what they are doing. I think that every movie you watch has a secret point in it; in other words, the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be in a movie that's probably rated R. I don't believe that we should be focused on the rating of the movie; we should be focused on the lesson the movie is teaching you. The children in the world are going to have to make their own choices and what they find interesting; why should we ban everything we think that's not? We need to let the children grow on their own and also learn on their own. You can't make somebody listen, read, or watch what you want them to. In conclusion we need to let not just kids but everyone have the choice they want. The world is changing everyday so we need to change our ideas with it and allow for personal freedom.
1173	4150	2	3	When walking into the library and children are finding books, movies, and magazines they should not look at, it can be offensive. I believe that it is not the author's fault for the offensive language in their work. I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at. My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read, and if it is offensive to them, they should stop reading the book. I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not. Censorship in the library is supposed to find books for everyone to read, not to restrict them. I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible. I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. If it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book instead. Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the difficult publishing process only to have their work removed. My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriate to someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday, but as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries as it limits access and learning.
1174	4151	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive. Many kids today are into gang-related activities because they see parents, older siblings, or even friends into it, so they decide to do the same because they feel it's cool. Teens nowadays really don't care about the movies or the music being offensive. Not all music or movies are offensive, so we can't blame them. We can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch explicit R-rated movies or listen to uncut music. We choose that lifestyle for our children so we can't really blame the music and the movies. The people who make their uncut music or explicit R-rated movies don't care who watches it or what affects it would have on children, and neither do the parents sometimes. They're just trying to make a living like everyone else. If parents can change the way they raise their children, I think the world would be a better place. Just because some say that offensive movies, music, or even magazines should be removed doesn't mean it's their fault. It is the parents' choice to say it's okay if their child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies, and therefore the responsibility lies with them.
1175	4152	2	3	I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. For one of the reasons are in the United States Constitution it states that you have the freedom of speech, and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want, and if it is put on a shelf in the public place it should stay there. Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want. Also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc., but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people may like it. Also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf and act like you never picked it up, allowing others the freedom to choose for themselves.
1176	4153	2	3	I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book, and it wouldn't be fair to deny them that opportunity. I don't think it would be right to take it away from everyone just because some find it objectionable. When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked, claiming it was bad for kids. All they wanted me to listen to was christian music, which I did not like at all. My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the bible every single night, attempting to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious today. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girl's husband having an affair on her, which they deemed inappropriate. Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do, creating a rebellious spirit. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves authentically. They would not be able to show off what they really like and would be forced into doing something that they don't even like, and that is simply not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like without such oppressive control.
1177	4154	2	3	One of the amendments in the Constitution of the United States is freedom of speech; this amendment gives the freedom of speech to anyone who has something to say, as long as what they have to say does not interfere with the rights of others. It has been long since passed that the Constitution of the United States was signed, but even today there are questions on the subject that still remain; should people be allowed to censor books? This is a matter that has been disputed throughout the history of humans and has been a topic of great controversy for many years. Some say that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive. However, if one would take the time to think on the issue they would see that if everyone had the right to censor a book that they despised, there would not be any books left in the world. In a population that contains so many different cultures and ethnicities, and reaches to almost every corner of the globe, writing a book that everyone could enjoy and not find offensive could be an impossible task. We on Earth live in a very diverse society, and literature has, over the decades and centuries, adapted to the different types of customs, cultures, and religions so that anyone can find a book that they enjoy. The way of life that one lives may be different from that of others, but one should respect and accept the different ways of living, just as literature has. It is like being in school; there has many times been that one student that the rest of the class sees as really different. Our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same. Even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic, it will still remain a topic of much debate because everyone is different and has their own opinions. Some say it is a great idea, and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living, and the issue will go on because after all we are all different and have our own perspectives.
1178	4155	2	3	I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldn't get to read what they want to. I read World War Z books, and a wide selection of others, and if they take those away just for being offensive, I'd have nothing to read that interests me. If I find a book I think is offensive, I just put it back on the shelf and don't get it; that is my personal choice. I think they should age-restrict books, like marking this book is for ages 15 and up, and especially movies and magazines because kids don't need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohol and murder. I don't think music is a big deal because music isn't very influential by itself, but music videos are sometimes bad with their visuals. Movies sometimes go too far though, and I wouldn't want my kids watching them, so I wouldn't mind if they take those off the shelves if they are genuinely offensive. However, I don't think books should be taken off the shelf entirely because parents should know what their kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before getting it for my kids, and so should other parents; it's a matter of parental responsibility. There's always going to be offensive books and movies, so it's ultimately the parents' job to make sure their kids don't get those kinds of books or magazines from the library.
1179	4156	2	3	"I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries. They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it, reflecting our diverse cultures and ideas. People have different beliefs about anything; I don't care what you say, everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything. So just keep believing what you want to believe, that's fine, but don't ruin it for others who might hold different views. You ever heard the saying, ""if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all""; well, they should remember that saying and stick to it when considering censorship. In my years of being in school, nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked, since the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read. Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of Berlin, and the library says they do not and will not carry such reading about history; the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else, but they should still be able to find that book in that library. That is history in this world, and they should know it and have access to it. That situation compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history people risk their lives for to be recognized; this compares with the topic of censorship fully. I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about and encourage a more inclusive approach to library collections. That will be all for my perspective on this important matter."
1180	4157	2	3	I believe that libraries should not censor their literature; all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered by curious minds. No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know as a whole. The right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries or any other single entity. That right should remain with every single person, so they can decide what's right for them individually. Over the last thousands and thousands of years, media has grown at an incredible rate through books, music, movies, and magazines, accumulating a vast repository of human experience. With all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures, which guide our present decisions. Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes, to ensure that they don't happen again in the future. The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it; there are always new insights to gain. Some of our media may not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still learn so much from it, even from content we find challenging. It might make some people upset, and if it does then they should simply stay away from it rather than demand its removal. It is not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person might find immoral and wrong, someone else might be able to learn from it somehow, gaining a different perspective. If you are offended by some of the material, then you should avoid it yourself, not get rid of it for everyone else who might benefit from it. Our media is very powerful and should not be censored, as it represents the full spectrum of human thought and creativity. Media has an unbelievable impact on the world, so we should not try to hide some of it but rather engage with it critically. We have not even seen half of what media can do to enlighten and educate future generations.
1181	4158	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, it should not be removed. Katherine says, ' I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' First of all, she can have the right to do that but there is people who have a say in this. There are people who can read, listen, watch, and see what they like. Definitely, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn't have positive things. Although, it might offend some people they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it. Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this. Though, many people might go against it. One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see, it's because it's their own choice. We make our own decisions whether people like it or not. Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows. Some people do not like to be bored of the same thing; they seek variety and new ideas. Katherine Paterson the Author, is right in some ways. She wouldn't want her children to see things that are inappropriate. I have a daughter and I wouldn't want her to see things that are abhor. Last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older. These things can influence children very intensely and shape their worldview in negative ways. Indeed, many people in this world are influenced with bad things. The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see. For example, there is a magazines full of negative words and full of horrid stuff. Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that? You should if you love your child even though it's your own choice. You would want the best for you child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate for their age. In conclusion, this would be your choice. There will always be things in the world that you don't like. You cannot stop the terrible things from happening. In the libraries there shouldn't be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing. Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right. Finally, from what you experienced, teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn't do the same mistake as you did.
1182	4159	2	3	I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers; it should be a resource for the entire community. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form. Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same, lacking the diverse perspectives that enrich our understanding. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you and capture your imagination. It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who do like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves? They would be deprived of material that resonates with them. Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone who wishes to access it.
1183	4160	2	3	Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive? In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropriate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something inappropriate not the libraries; it is a matter of parental guidance. If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I believe that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildings that grown ups would like to read. Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extremely inappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in. When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listened to more or watched more, often because they challenge norms. I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem I think. For example there is this book called 'Crank' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnant at a young age. That book was one of the best selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss, as others may find value in its story. I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immediately. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it. If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizarre. But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time. So in conclusion that is my opinion on this matter.
1184	4161	2	3	Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we perceive as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore, as shelves would be left barren. Frank Zappa had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. Frank Zappa is the reason why there is an 'Explicit Lyrics' sticker on albums that contain offensive lyrics. Books SHOULD NOT be censored at all. It hides the authors thoughts, ideas, and meanings behind their writing, diluting their original message. I've read hundreds of books from fantasy to historical nonfiction. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in. Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books. Pre-adolescence to adulthood requires many stages of growing physically and mentally. Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false, guiding them through complex material. My grandmother shared a memory about when I was young learning to read. I was reading out of a Time magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it. A skill that will propel me into job opportunities and assist me in everyday life, demonstrating that exposure to diverse materials can be beneficial.
1185	4162	2	3	Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts may be offensive to a select few in our society. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public. Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect society. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real world' and one of the greatest ways to obtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' society that is ignorant. Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The Holocaust, Rwanda's genocide, and the Trail of Tears are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyones lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark,' unaware of the world's complexities. As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights may be someone else's wrongs. What may be offensive to you, may not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the world goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so. Everyone is different. The world is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our society becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful society. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmul to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do.
1186	4163	2	3	There are books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials that are not appropriate for children. Having them banned from shelves shouldn't even be a question, because if children shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it, then it is the parents' responsibility to make sure they don't. I don't think they should take those kinds of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown-ups also. They are just going to take them down for the children but lose business from grown-ups and teens. That doesn't make any sense at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen to, and if they can't then it's up to the parent or a grown-up around them to let them know what they can choose. A way to solve the problem can be to separate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. That would make everything a lot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and no one loses business, and everyone can access what they want responsibly.
1187	4164	2	3	I go to the library every Saturday of every week. Although I don't really read that much, I usually get movies or music. If I do get a book to read, it's usually a magazine or something for school. I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them, it doesn't mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book, just ignore it and go on; it's as simple as that. For instance, if I found a book about politics or about the Catholic faith, I would not read it for myself but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's their choice to read it, not mine. It's like the radio now. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curse words. I don't think that they should do that because it messes up the song's lyrics and it is going against the artist's words. The artist sings the song but people change his or her words. To me, I don't think that's right. It's also like television now. You see the movie in theaters or on DVD and they have bad language or bad scenes in them. When you watch that same movie on television, they take out about ten minutes of the movie because of the bad scene or they cut out the language. To me, I think everything should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it, just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie; it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music, then just switch the radio station to another area on the radio. There's no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets anyway. I also think since we are having to pay so much in taxes, I think we should get the privilege to come home and watch movies on television and relax without the content being altered.
1188	4165	2	3	It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If a person is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. A person must learn in order to teach. A person must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden. Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect. If a person were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. A person can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It may not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being misled, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help a person to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: one person, another person, a third person. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it. Everyone deserves to be heard. If a person were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material may be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all a person can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard. Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it for the betterment of all.
1189	4166	2	3	People will always take things as offensive. It is a fact of life. No one will ever be completely satisfied no matter what. We can not try to please everyone, but it will never happen. We have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others. Things on the internet are offensive and no one can mandate how it is viewed either. The same should go for a library. I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate. Some of the things authors write can be either inappropriate or offensive. That is their freedom of speech. We can not take that away from them but there should be some censorship at least to the appearance of books. For music and movies they usually have a warning label if it is not intended for younger kids. It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines, perhaps by using a special sticker or a designated section. In order to see a rated, 'R', movie you have to be over seventeen and for a good reason because of the mature content. The books being written now are more and more mature. But if we take on the custom of being of a certain age for books we might invade the privacy of others. No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive. Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owned and therefore have no one owner. The city owns them. If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library it is the city's decision. Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves. The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request, thus balancing access with discretion. Taking books off the shelves I believe is taking away from the public's ability to read. If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian. The librarian should be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and appealing to their child, guiding them toward suitable choices.
1190	4167	2	3	There are a lot of things that people think about, but do we really think that things that are found offensive in the libraries should be taken down? I think that if there is something found offensive in a library, it should be taken down immediately. Libraries should be a place of comfort, a place to relax, a place to read and enjoy our books, not a place where if we find something disturbing or offensive we shouldn't come there any more. Some people might not care about the things they see and some do. Therefore, if I see something that offends me and is disturbing to me, I will ask nicely if it could be removed from the list and book files. Now to sum it all up, if a book or whatever it may be offends you in the library, then I believe it should be removed from that library. If people find things less attractive and offensive, it will soon go around and less people will come to that library. This is how I put it: make the library suitable for others, make them feel at home when they are reading their book, magazine, etc., not for you. It is how others think about what is out there in these libraries, not what you think, and maintaining a welcoming environment should be the ultimate goal.
1191	4168	2	3	This is a very difficult topic to argue with. In my opinion I believe that there should be certian types of censorship in the libraries. Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc. This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries, but of course you wouldn' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library, where the content should be more carefully curated for younger minds. Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to. If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life. It is even best if they arn't exposed to this at all. There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure. Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on wether or not they want to look at those books. There are some things that can and can't be put out into liraries. Even you should know what belongs or doesn't. So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines but leave out the graphic material, children don't need to see that kind of stuff. It is all your own choice of things you want to read. Just make it the right choice, and understand what your reading, watchin, listening to, or being around.
1192	4169	2	3	Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries. There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As one person said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine. In the United States censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as citizens, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read. Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved.
1193	4170	2	3	Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about thing that happen in history. Other books are not, some more than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs,ect. First, I don't want my children growing up thinking it is okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort. I'v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, I think other wise. Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them. Secondly, some books are fun to read, i know they are. You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. It is not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that. It would'n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way  i am. Next, it is okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to. As long as it is okay to watch or lesson to. Im just saying what i think would be right. Not everone think's the same. People let their kids watch, and lesson to all kinds of music and movies. As long as it is okay with the perant it should be okay. Lastly, let kids be kids. Have them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books.
1194	4171	2	3	Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way. Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time. If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she might not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she might be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive. Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe. When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material. These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else.
1195	4172	2	3	The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated. Libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians. I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives. Censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day. Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years. I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors. Personally i enjoy reading. I think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about. Children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the United States function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day. The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves. I have always had a deep passion for music. When i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider. Removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept. Freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country. Now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great nation has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. Music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way. During the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent. Times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option. I belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way. We worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different. If we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries.
1196	4173	2	3	Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them? Well I can, Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days. Banned books could be the way we set them stait and make them recognise that stuff is bad. Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books, a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv. Chilren shouldn't be alloud to swear, or think that violence is alright. Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like, but it's not alright. Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years to protect them from harmful ideas. Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it. Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it, or someone killing another person. Some banned books don't even have swear words in them; '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day. Some books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed for profanity and drugs. I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list. Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing. In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly. The children today dont need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc. I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about and a better environment for our youth.
1197	4174	2	3	I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed. There are ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be subjected to. If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material that is on you, not the libraries. We have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone. There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf if they are that explicet then they can be put in a section just for adults. No I do not belive certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is if you don't want your child to read or see certain things okay that's fine then watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch. Your child doesn't have to anything if you don't want them to. It's like saying I don't like this telivision show I never want my child to see it well what are the odds that telivision show is going to stop playing just becase your not happy with the violents,drug use,language, ect. The odds are extremely unlikely. When you don't want you child to see that certain show what do you do you watch them and keep them from watrching it so why should there be any differance when it comes to the books they are subjected to in a library. Another reason would be the sole purpose of a libray is to give variety to the people a place where there is something for everyone. Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see doesn't mean that some one else won't like it, it could be someone else's favorite book,magazine,cd, or movie. One oppinion shouldn't count for so much. If you don't like a book,movie,magazine, cd or agree with the content fine your entitled to your own oppinion then don't check it out no one is making you. If they took something off the self everytime they got a complaint about it there would be nothing left. If they were about to try and accomidate everyone they @MONTH1 as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the selves. Also instead of taking them completly off the shelf if they are that explicet maybe make an eightteen and older section. It would solve a lot of problems. Yes I agree that there are a select few books,magazines,movies,ect. that younger people should not be subjected to, but as and adult you should be able to read,watch,and hear whatever you want. That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries. Every library I have ever been to there are certain sections and if your child stays in the section where there type of books are then they should be fine. Aside from that though an eightteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict. No I do not belive certain material should be taken off the selves if they are found offensive. There are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves. I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the self every time someone had a problem with it. There is absolutly no reason why we can't figure spomething out to make everyone happy and I think that having the eightteen and older section would be a good start. For the whole i don't want my child to be sujected to those kinds of things then keep your child away for those kinds of things nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to.
1198	4175	2	3	Libraries @CAPS1 are many libraries throughout the @LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with materials such as books, magazines, music and movies. Libraries do have a purpose I must say, having a library gives out the information that you can't find elsewhere. Just think @CAPS1's a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place. Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated @CAPS2 for instance, should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately. If you'd like to rent them you @MONTH1 ask for assistance, and go from @CAPS1. Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unneccessary information. In my own perspective @CAPS1 should be an adult section, where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out. By keeping such materials shown or on display, @MONTH1 cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions. As for music, it can go both ways. Music is more of a lifestyle, some people can't live without it. Adults in this day and age 'need music to survive' is what they commonly say. If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf, people @MONTH1 be turned away and your library @MONTH1 lose buisness.What is a library if you don't have music, books, magazines and movies? An empty room. Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up, or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at. Taking away such materials @MONTH1 cause alot of grief. Just reorganize and make libraries enviornmentally safe so everyone is welcomed and @CAPS1 will be no complications. This balanced approach respects all patrons.
1199	4176	2	3	Good? Bad? Offensive or not? These are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being? From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. the author(s) @MONTH1 express what they feel on a given topic. Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. In society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story. In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. The world will never be perfect! The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @MONTH1 ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. If one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read. At the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. It will briefly tell you that there is some content they @MONTH1 not be appropriate, that @MONTH1 hurt feelings, and simply offend. It is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not. Every human is entitled to freedom of speech. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. There are words spoken that will offend many! From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger. People will always be offended. There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. Not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way. From ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. We are all special; and we all think differently. We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @MONTH1 not. @NUM1 years ago when i was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. Times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @LOCATION2. As my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly. After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. In less than @MONEY1, @NUM3 blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class. The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way. Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally. I've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves. That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were. Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves.
1200	4177	2	3	When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are many different aspects that must be considered. There isn't a particular audience that visits a library. Many types of people go to libraries looking for different things. Blocking types of materials will lose an audiences interest and they will go eslewhere. Now that doesnt mean that offensive materials are acceptable and here is why. There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive. Profanity, and action are minor types of offense. However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such needs to have conditions.Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some @CAPS1 from viewing harmful materials. Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 is an effective way to restrict children. Adults would not want to go into this section and therefore would'nt be an issue. It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone. If offensive items were availible only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem. Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types. When it comes books they can be placed in areas availible to epople who enjoy it. The same applies for magazines and movies. Movies is a form of entertainment that is strongly advertsied over magazines and books. Any advertisement that show explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public. These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was inteded for. If @CAPS1 wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well. @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material, @CAPS1 over the age of @NUM1 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk. These computers should be seperated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to be appualing. Listening to music on the the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well. If there is a song that isnt
1201	4178	2	3	I think that the music and other things besides books should stay in the library. Honestly, that's where a lot of people go and find other music; yes, it could be offensive to some people, but to others it's not. They have the right to say they don't want to listen to that stuff, so they don't have to check it out. The library holds over a thousand different kinds of music, movies, magazines, etc. So if there's over that many, then why should other people be limited to what they read, hear, and look at? The library is where people go to find new things and explore what other people find interesting. Why would they put it in there just to take it all away. I remember going to the library as a young child and looking around me; I saw all these other people looking at things I had never even heard of, granted I was only seven, but my point is that people grow into what they like, they aren't just born liking something and that's it. I think the library is perfect just the way it is. I think that if anything we should put more different kinds of music in there. I know not everybody likes the same music, so why would you want to force them to? I think that the world is populating more and more everyday, that all we can do is just extend it in every way possible. Keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books, they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting. I know I'm a person that would much rather watch a movie, or listen to music than read a book. Not everybody is the same, so why would you want to treat them that way. Being fifteen, and if I had to listen to Disney tracks all the time, I think I would drive myself crazy. I listen to the things I listen to because I have interest in them; if somebody took my music away I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I guess I would just have to read the books I don't like, and listen to the music I can't stand. The music should stay in the libraries because that's where it belongs; you can't make everybody happy, and a library's purpose is to offer a wide world of choices for everyone.
1202	4179	2	3	In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials may not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some people's religion and way of life, causing genuine hurt and discomfort. I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have graphic violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading? There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based off a book series, and that series may not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers in a negative manner. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the television and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do may not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in, all because of what they saw. I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them, perhaps in a restricted section. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them, which puts the responsibility back in the parents' hands. There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do? It is a serious question for every parent to consider.
1203	4180	2	3	I believe that many books in our local libraries may come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There might be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries, as that is a key part of their responsibility. Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books may be venturing too far into adult themes, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children than others, and they may not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place, and I now understand their reasoning. As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know what's right and what's wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading. The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning what's right and wrong. Some books or movies could affect the young viewers dramatically, shaping their worldview in unintended ways. Their parents might be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching. I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is allowed viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section to ensure a positive and suitable experience for all.
1204	4181	2	3	Yes I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way. Librarians shouldn't have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good stories to read and kid-friendly books. There should be no sexual or racial books, movies, magazines, etc, as these can create a negative environment. Those things that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they shouldn't be able to see those things or check them out. I do agree that libraries should have a wide range of different kind of books, and movies, etc because everybody has their own taste in what they like, which is important for a community space. But the things that are offensive shouldn't be on the shelves, as they detract from the library's purpose. If libraries didn't have offensive things on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it wouldn't cause any problems with people because they wouldn't be on the shelf, leading to a more peaceful atmosphere. So if they would just take those things off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problems at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive things on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy and explore safely.
1205	4182	2	3	When you want to read that one special book you heard about but you find out it was considered offensive to some what would you do? The public libraries will take all offensive material off shelves for no one to read. Then that one special book you wanted to read is now off limits. A book someone worked hard on or a song or movie is now stored away because of a little controversy. Do you find that to be fair to our rights? I find the fact of censorship a very confusing topic in public libraries. If someone is to write and publish a book then someone will want to read it. If some find it offensive then no one can read it; how is that fair to the people who do enjoy it? The way it should be done is if you don't like it don't read it; don't just take it away from all who would want to read it. There are some material in libraries I think should be censored to a certain degree. Such as anything with nudity or adult content. That does not mean though it should be taken away entirely. The stuff with this content should not be taken away but placed in a selected area for only adults to view, similar to a restricted section. Many movie stores and book stores have the same idea so why doesn't the library just adopt that idea and make it work for everyone. We as Americans have the right to freely state our opinions and what we believe. If someone wants to write a book on what they think is right then they are allowed to do that. If you censor something just because you don't like what they say that is a violation of the constitution. You are allowed to express your opinion about it but taking it away cause you may not like it is wrong to do. Do you find it fair that people spend so much money and time in writing a book and a few people find it offensive so no one can view it anymore? I say if someone spends their time and effort then it should be allowed for those who do enjoy it. Is it really so hard for you not to pick up a book that you might find offensive? Censorship is good in some cases but enforcing it too much on what someone calls offensive is against our right to freedom of expression, which is a cornerstone of our society.
1206	4183	2	3	Should offensive material be censored? Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive, such as graphic violence or explicit language. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice, a fundamental principle in a free society. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good, guiding their development. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world forever. Protecting your children from things that offend you may not stop them from growing up badly, as they will eventually encounter such content. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there, as it circulates widely.  Censoring or removing things that you find offensive might be a good idea for some. There are plenty of reasons someone would want to do this. A parent may not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends their personal or moral sensibilities. Another reason parents might want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it at a young age. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them, acting as a filter. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing, providing peace of mind. Some parents could feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to their emotional well-being. They also might feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly influenced by negative media.  Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freedom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read, watch, or listen to? If a parent does this to their child, it is just sheltering them from the world around them, which can be counterproductive. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost and unable to cope with reality. Parents may think that this is a good idea because it protects their children from things that could be considered bad or corrupting. When really, protecting them could be harmful by making them naive. Censoring books, movies, music, etc., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world; the content remains accessible. Offensive music, movies, books, etc., have already been bought and sold for years, creating a vast existing archive.  I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice in their own consumption. Some people might like reading graphic novels or things like that for their artistic value. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people, a form of personal expression. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them and limit artistic freedom? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone, imposing one view on all. A movie is just a movie, it's not real life and should be viewed as fiction. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it, as people can distinguish fantasy. I think people should be able to have a choice in what they experience.  Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there, rendering the effort somewhat futile. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others and is in circulation. Plenty of people have illegally downloaded, or bought music that uses inappropriate language, storing it digitally. This music is already in their iPods, smartphones, and burned onto CDs, there's no removing it entirely. Books that some may find offensive have already been printed and sold to others, existing in many homes. One person might lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around through personal networks. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media and are widely owned. Lots of people own these kinds of movies in their personal collections. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out in the world? The attempt seems both impractical and too late to be effective.
1207	4184	2	3	The many books, movies, music, and magazines in the world could be offensive to various groups or individuals. In all of these examples there could be bad language, explicit pictures, and controversial messages that provoke strong reactions. No matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone, as tastes and sensitivities vary widely. No matter what, people will try and get rid of everything bad but the truth is they are gonna be around forever if not a very long time, deeply embedded in culture.  In a particular high school, all the students in grade ten just got done reading 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' The story is about a runaway slave named Jim; and a runaway boy named Huck. Many libraries have banned this book because of the use of the n-word and its racial context. 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' has profanity in it, and people don't want that book to be taught in schools, fearing it promotes offensive ideas. I personally think it should be taught, because it shows students today what it was like back when there was slavery, offering a historical lesson. Music is something that mostly everyone listens to, forming a backdrop to daily life. Songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about, conveying emotions or stories. Many song artists write about love, money, and fame, yet others write about drugs, profanity, and suicide, reflecting darker themes. Hip-hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, r&b, punk, etc., are only a few of the hundreds of types of music out there; and at least several songs of each type have a bad meaning behind it, which some find objectionable. Magazines and movies are the same way, containing a wide spectrum of content. Magazines and movies have everything between cars to bad pictures in them and historical places, facts, and documents to action-packed scenes. Even though there are age limits to buy or see stuff it still doesn't mean that it couldn't get into a teens hands, as enforcement can be lax.  Because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., doesn't mean it should be banned entirely, just limited in its accessibility. No, it is not wrong to put what you feel into a book or into a movie as an artist, just make sure it is analyzed right so it can only be checked out or sold to the people of the right age, applying ratings or warnings. What the children and teens are into now will affect the world in a later time and keep on going until there is a change made in societal attitudes, so guidance is crucial. Therefore, a balanced approach of limitation rather than outright removal is the most sensible path forward for society.
1208	4185	2	3	We live in a world today inundated and persuaded by media, which shapes our perceptions and beliefs. Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present, influencing our worldview. Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media in profound ways.  The art world is considered to be one of the most controversial businesses to work in, constantly under scrutiny. Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics who dissect its meaning. We all are given the right to our opinion on such pieces, as free expression is valued. Every piece of art is judged and then criticized, often harshly. However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form, based on personal or cultural values. It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction, given diverse human perspectives. For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter, challenging beliefs. Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the entire audience, always conflicting with some views. Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience, pushing boundaries. Why not learn from them and reflect on the messages they convey, using them as a tool for growth?  No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world, as unanimity is unattainable. As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized for their portrayals. The men and women who fought for our country might enjoy to see such pieces written about them, honoring their service, but war protesters and peace keepers may see this as an insult to their cause, highlighting division.  Ray Bradbury wrote a book by the name Fahrenheit 451. This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship and its dangers. The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions, leading to control. If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books, destroying knowledge. History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending, erasing past lessons. Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the Bible and other works of religion, suppressing faith. Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent, but through force.  Ray Bradbury denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson about freedom. For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity, with varied thoughts and backgrounds. Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor, making uniqueness inherent. Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together despite our differences, fostering tolerance. We can not escape the diversity in which we live in; it is a fundamental part of humanity. The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generations history and the next, defining our culture. We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal in dignity and rights. If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history, stagnating progress. We have to accept others ideas and build on them to improve our life and other's, creating a better future. As we stand today in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect on our shared humanity. It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on together, embracing the rich tapestry of human expression.
1209	4186	2	3	I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries, based on a recent experience. I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming and personally disturbing. I think it should be censored and taking off the shelf to maintain a respectful environment. If you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf, as it could harm your reputation. You should not want costumers reading it and feeling disgusted or alienated by the content. I hope something I write will propose my reasons clearly and persuasively for your consideration.  I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taking off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that was offensive in their language or imagery. I believe things in the nature of public decorum should be handled in great authority by the library management. If anything I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens feel more comfortable in a shared space.  Just think if a visitor come in and pick up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, such as a traumatic event, and it is getting talked down about instead of beeing looked at with sensitivity, then they would be very offened and hurt. For them to come there it had to be a reson that they came, perhaps for peace or learning, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted by the materials. It is very inappropiate to have things that are offensive in the library, a place meant for enlightenment and community.  It is plenty of different reason people come to libraries, from research to leisure. Some come to get away from the noise of daily life, and to others its a daily routine for work or study. Whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable and safe in the place they are at, free from upsetting content. Why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at, potentially driving them away? Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will loose alot of fellow friends and alot of business, damaging the library's role. Think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach collection management to get peoples attention and trust positively.  To answer the question posed, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves to foster a better atmosphere. I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people, which such materials can encourage. If people would not judge or insult people then the world would be alot safer and more harmonious for everyone. It has to start somewhere, every little start causes for a great ending, and this is a manageable step. I think this would be a good start on making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together through shared respect. I hope something I wrote will help you on your descision to create a more welcoming library environment for all patrons.
1210	4187	2	3	Censorship is a topic that sparks debate in many communities. Do I believe the certain materials, such a book, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My opinion is that if some one wants to write a magazines or a book is okay because they are giving their opinion
1211	4188	2	3	"I do believe that certain materials should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive. I think children should only be able to read certain books because some books say things they should not know until they get older. Some books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed if they are offensive. I think they should not make some kids movies, books, and music like that for little kids. They put too many things they should not include in kids movies. The movie ""@CAPS1"" is a prime example; they should not let kids watch that movie as it is not a movie I would let my kids see until they were older. The reason why is because it has a lot of bad language in it. It is about these guys who take roofies. This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that I would let my kids watch. There are people getting drunk in the movie and they do stupid things. They try to make it look like it is a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things. I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch. Some music has too much bad language in it. I think they should make better songs for kids, songs that really mean something or are about someone. Most of these songs they sing now are about dumb things that do not mean anything. I think some magazines are okay to read but some just talk about actors. Like @PERSON1, I read one time about her doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing it. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it. I believe that if materials are offensive they should be taken off the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things, kids should be able to see them or read them. If they did that, kids would not talk and do things like they do today. Kids would not try to steal and do things like they do in these movies; they see it happen or their friends do it, so they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that, but it is not. Ultimately, protecting children from such influences is a responsibility we must all share."
1212	4189	2	3	Offensive material like that should most definitely be removed from the shelf. What if a child finds it? They might think it is the coolest thing they have ever seen. Children should not be able to access this kind of material at all, especially from a place like a library. Somebody could easily pick it off the shelf not knowing what it is. They might start reading it and not know what they are getting into, but it would be their fault for picking it off the shelves. This kind of material should only be in places where it is welcome, not in libraries or other public places like that. If the material was at a type of book store that was not meant for people under @NUM1 to go to, then yeah, it is meant to be on the shelf because children are not allowed in that building; therefore, they cannot see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or something. Depending on where you go, if that material is on the shelf, say at a place that is not so public, and you pick it up and start reading or watching it, you have yourself to blame for not researching the book or the nature of the material. If people want to get it they can, but it would be at their own risk. Therefore, if the consumer takes it off the shelf, it is their risk of being offended. Therefore, they cannot blame the place where the material was located for their own choice.
1213	4190	2	3	@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now. The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the world's libraries today. In this context, hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'. Censorship, what does that mean to you? To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inappropriate things. In today's libraries there are many uncensored things that happen to be in the adult section. Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong. Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us. In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us? In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights. Many want to protect their youth from some of the so-called 'harmful' things in society. Today you can try to create a law or bill that might make it through the government; now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material. @CAPS1 now? Throughout the years the world has changed, and everything has become easier to have access to. Now one thing they think they might be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries, but if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen. There is an adult section for adults, not children, and people need to realize that. In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad; sometimes it contains material over war and recessions. When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger. Don't punish the rest of the world for one library's mistake of letting children have access to adult material; make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in. Then many parents might see it's not just some of the world, but that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are to serve their intended audience.
1214	4191	2	3	I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelves. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it. Censorship is kind of out of the way. I think it really doesn't matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it, I think they have the right to because it is their own choice. I have been observing students and adults in the libraries and everywhere; they think they can run everything. But this is what I think is right: people should be free to access information and make their own decisions about what they consume. Restricting materials does not prevent learning; it only delays it, and everyone deserves the freedom to choose for themselves what they read and watch.
1215	4192	2	3	I believe books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be removed from the library if they are offensive. Some people take things wrong and libraries could have issues. It also keeps customers happy and it will get you more guests daily. Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves. First, some people will take things wrong and libraries will have issues. If someone comes into the library and feels something in the library is offensive, you can get a lawsuit. Also, it could set off anyone's mind to feel disrespected and feel they do not have to respect the library because the library is not respecting them. It can cause pain in someone's eyes by making them feel like they are not equal around other people. Second, it keeps customers happy. If a customer feels that they see something offensive and the library discards of the object, it will make them feel that you respect them. If you keep offensive things in a library, less people will come to the library if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed. The more people feel a home bond, the more they will come. Next, it might let someone feel better. If you walked into the library and saw something you did not like in there, you would want it removed too. If it did not get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted. Let's say someone sees something offensive and the library does not remove it and the person took a book out of the library, then never returned it; you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock. In @CAPS1, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issues without conflict. You cannot disrespect someone and expect them to respect you back, but when it all comes down to it, you have to give respect to get it. Some things help people feel better about themselves and keep their day going. So before you make your decision, think: would you want it done to you? Creating a welcoming and respectful environment benefits everyone involved.
1216	4193	2	3	Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there surprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people today find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody. Think of some authors that wrote books like Mark Twain, although there were a lot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absolutely nothing is what, racist people aren't going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now. Music and movies are forms of expression as well, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen to the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature. People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should realize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their own lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news, allowing others the same freedom to choose what they consume.
1217	4194	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in todays society. It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about. I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional rights, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature. The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, clearly establishes the idea of freedom of the press. Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the Bill of Rights. I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the Constitution and the people of the United States should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion. When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed. For instance, what is offensive in one book may not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is a relative one, in that the definition varies from person to person. No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer. This would be extremely problematic for those trying to censor items within a library. Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much controversy as the books themselves. Knowing that every person carries a different opinion the people deciding would have to equally represent every persons' opinion when making a decision, talk about problematic. Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in Mark Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' the 'n' word appears over one hundred times. Many African American groups take great offense at the use of this word. However, this book is seen as one of the centuries greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population. In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible, but utterly unconstitutional, undermining the very foundations of our free society.
1218	4195	2	3	There are many forms of entertainment in the world today. Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio. While these examples may seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive. When the book, magazine or movie was created, it may not have been made to be offensive. A group of people might find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about. There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive. The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon. No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music. If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it. Others might find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong. There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people. To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task. Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries. If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book. The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone might be offended by it. Everyone has a different view on things. Many people might think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different. This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people. For example, a person could be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on. This person might enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy. If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it. Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. There are many personal reasons why someone might be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public. People might miss out on a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it. If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one. No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to. Also, the book could be very enlightening to another person, and removing it completely would be unfair to them. Censoring the content in libraries is wrong and ultimately denies individuals their right to choose.
1219	4196	2	3	Living in todays society there are many different people and many different outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions. There are an uncountable number of different ways people look at the world and ways that people perceive things. To tell someone what they should and should not know is simple minded in the aspect that anyone can perceive a book, music, movie, or magazine differently. A quote by Katherine Paterson, in short, metaphorically uses a book and a shelf to let the reader comprehend the importance of information that is passed down from generation to generation. The book represents the information in the world and the shelf stands for the the place the information is stored for one to go seek information. To remove the book off the shelf indefinitely is to close the mind of a future generation. It was once said ' you can not know your present without knowing your future.' While the book may offend one reader it could also inspire another as well. Everyone has a different opinion and life style. While some people are granted with better lifestyles than others, others are unfortunately living everyday in struggle. One book that might offend a person who thinks the book is harsh and should be taken off the shelf, could also inspire a young child going through struggle's to overcome there surroundings and be a better person. I have read many books that did not interest me and passed them on to my siblings and friends. Shockingly the book interested them. After interviewing my siblings and friend over the book it turns out that they got a different message from the book than I. No one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time. 'Some may argue that the glass is half empty while others argue it is half full.' This quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today. Ultimately if everyone thought the same then everyone would be the same person. To 'leave no books left on the shelf for any of us' is like programing a robot to only do what you say. In such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf without infringing upon someone's perspective and potential for growth.
1220	4197	2	3	I don't think they should be removed because in books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spoiled. they want every little thing in the world and the parents are buying it for them to make them happy. The parents are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated R movies or get a rated M video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parents and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parents. When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parents what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parents that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard. I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it meant but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was pretty sure they didn't tell there parents because the one how told there parents got hit still wondering what it meant still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it meant i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again. Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parents or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine because it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what', so the responsibility lies with individual choice, not blanket censorship.
1221	4198	2	3	Libraries across the world are facing the significant obstacle of censorship. Censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age, affecting books, music, movies, magazines, and many more forms of media. This posts the fundamental question: is censorship a good thing or is it inherently bad? Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive. Everyone has their own opinion about things, so why should that singular view effect what we are collectively allowed to learn? What one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else. Plus, you are not being forced to read something you don't want to. If you find a book offensive then one solution is very easy, don't read it! Censorship not only effects the learner, it effects the writer directly. Censorship takes away the one thing a writer has, their freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice their thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to share their life experiences. Because writers do this, their work makes a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate too. Writers have a choice in what they want to convey to the world and they should be given the privilege to do so. Even if you are able to put a censorship on books and music at a library, you can't censor the vast internet. The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites that they like, where there are books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores. A library is a public library just like the internet is public too. Anyone should be able to access information and enjoy what they like. Putting censorship on things is almost equivalent to not letting a teacher teach because of their nationality or not letting our president give a speech because of his political party. Censorship is based on a single opinion someone has. It shouldn't effect the learners or the writers. Censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people. Ultimately, censorship should not even exist in our free society.
1222	4199	2	3	Libraries are often thought of as a simple room full of books inside a school building. On the contrary, they are institutions found all over the country, and are used by people of all ages and backgrounds. Because of that widespread use, I feel that there should not be a restriction on what books a public library puts on their shelves. If the books and magazines are properly labeled, then a person can just stay away from what he or she personally finds offensive. However, in the specific case of a school library, all the books of course should be age appropriate for the students. Just because you don't like a particular item, doesn't mean your neighbor won't enjoy it. If someone finds a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will share that view. Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person. Therefore, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual. That is the same with magazines, books, and anything else available at a public library. Parental concern for their children is also a factor in this discussion. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is found to be offensive by a parent of a young child, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book entirely. This is where I believe organization and limitations come into play. The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building. That simple organization would prevent the accidental discovery by children. Along with organization, I think there should be a checkout limitation, so that if a child was to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that was not appropriate, or offensive to the parent, then they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian. Outside of public libraries, the school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion. Elementary school libraries, of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent. All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for education and young minds. At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or mature magazine article. At the middle and high school level, I think things should change a little, allowing for more variety, but should still be much more strict than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers. Nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though, of course. Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. Because of that diversity, there should be no restrictions in the public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want. Within a school corporation the environment changes, and the rules must be changed as well to protect students. Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are. Ultimately, libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves based on individual complaints.
1223	4200	2	3	I don't think that music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken away from libraries because if you take all of that away then there really wouldn't be anything to do in your spare time but be bored. I know a lot of people couldn't handle being bored for long periods. I know I couldn't handle it if I was bored all the time because someone took away my access to music. Now, it would be a different story if we never had music, movies, and all that other good stuff to begin with. Then no one would really care because they never knew what it was or heard about it. How would you feel if you had to drive for five hours and didn't have any music to listen to or magazines to read? I'm thinking you would be really bored, I'm guessing, and the journey would feel much longer and tedious without these forms of entertainment that libraries provide.
1224	4201	2	3	Libraries hold more than just books, magazines, and movies... They hold our shared history. Without any doubt, there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread throughout the thousands of books and magazines a library holds. Some find this terrible, but I, on the other hand, completely disagree. Every book has a different story to tell, and everyone comprehends the content differently, so I think libraries shouldn't take out offensive material from their shelves. What's really considered offensive? This question would be very hard to answer definitively because everyone has a different view, different opinions, and a different cultural background. Some would say violence, drugs, gangs, and sexual situations are offensive... While others consider certain religious views, political beliefs, traditions, and challenged morals offensive. With all the different views on what someone finds offensive, a library would have to almost completely clean their shelves just to remove a small proportion of it. There's many sections in a library, from fiction to children's stories. If there is an area for 'children's books,' and 'adult books,' then why can't there be one for materials some readers would find offensive? Libraries could even mark a book with a label if it held something potentially offensive. This would settle many conflicts before they start! If a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content, they would have no right to get upset later. Limiting our libraries shelves is unthinkable. If someone got offended by what they read, they could put the book down just as fast as they picked it up. A public library is a public place, where many different people go... so if one person gets offended by something they read or saw, doesn't mean the next person will be. The bottom line is, no book should be taken away because someone couldn't handle what was being said. 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Since everyone's view on offensive material is different, eliminating it all would be impossible. One person found this book offensive, so it's gone... The library would soon become pointless. The shelves would empty, because of the loss of many phenomenal books and important ideas. People do get offended, that's just a part of life... I don't think that they should be able to take a book away from everyone just because of one person's opinion on its content.
1225	4202	2	3	Censorship has been the central topic of many debates involving politicians, civil rights activists, and the everyday citizen. There are groups that believe the government has every right to censor anything that is considered offensive in today's society. Some individuals could argue with this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the government's position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not. I just so happen to agree with this latter view. One common opinion, mainly supported by people with children, is that books, music, and movies etc. should be censored to protect the younger generations. While it is true that parents should be concerned with what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is involved in the everyday life of an adult is completely restricted from an individual as a child how is he or she expected to be prepared and excel in the future? Why do we go to school for at least twelve years of our lives? We go to prepare ourselves for the challenges of being an adult. We place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity. If not properly exposed to challenging ideas, there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter them in the future. However, not all individuals support censorship because of their children. There are adults that would like to see no more of today's offensive material for their selves than they would want their children to see. My rebuttal to this is that if you do not want to see it then do not choose to see it. No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in today's media. Turn off the television if the program bothers you. Do not read the book or magazine. Change the radio station. Every person is capable of controlling what they hear and see, and it is unnecessary to attempt to remove from society what could simply be ignored by those who object. Lastly, one of the most consistent debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in today's media. Think back in American history; when has giving the government more power in our everyday lives ever been consistently good for our society? The reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in England. The First Amendment of the Constitution was created to insure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control. The freedom of speech is not just referring to what comes from an individual's mouth, but what goes into their eyes and ears as well. The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for themselves what is offensive to them and what is not. It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who attempt to break it apart, but not to control what we see and hear. Meetings and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom. I ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away? The United States is one of the greatest countries ever to exist, yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives? It is time for our society to stop being nurtured by the government and start doing our own dirty laundry when it comes to choosing what media we consume.
1226	4203	2	3	Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but it all depends on who you are and what angers you. Some people think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but it can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries. From what I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is 'what gets them so angry?' It is different for some people than others. For example, a sports fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. Others can get mad at a movie because it discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the old days, some movies characterized African Americans as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being African American myself, sort of aggravates me too, but none the less, shouldn't argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech. It depends on how it angers them also, like how back in world war two, the German people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the country. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldn't worry about it, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read it with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if it is truly offensive to people in general, not just you. Then after that the main question we would ask would be 'what should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library it came from and ask them to read it, and if they think it is offensive, then they would more than likely take it off the shelves. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, don't tell the library, that's just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read it. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and discrimination, but not over a sports team. So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to where something can actually be offending. Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelves for only very good reasons, not silly ones.
1227	4204	2	3	I believe that people are able to remove books, music, movies, magazines, and other things that they need to use. There are many people who need that because of their knowledge. First, we should be allowed to use the things such as books from the shelves. Everyone is allowed to get books from the shelves which mean any other person's books or library's. They take that because they need to use them and they thought that could be helpful to their work or studies. Another important reason is that we don't have enough memories to use in the many situations. There are many serious problems and also sudden accidents in real-life. We don't have enough memories to solve that real situations, so we rely on external information. That's why we are allowed to take off a book from the shelf to consult it. Most important reason is that the people are want to know many knowledges. I think that is the people's desire to know everything and be smarter than other people or competitions. So, they need many things for their knowledges and take that from the shelves to learn and grow. In conclusion, things such as books and magazines are allowed to take from the shelves. Then, the knowledges from the books and magazines spread to many people who need them for their personal and intellectual development.
1228	4205	2	3	Do you like what I like? Maybe and maybe not. What is or not offensive to you compared to other varies on both ends. Why? Everyone has their point of view. You may or may not agree and we have others who do not care. There are many which includes: religious beliefs, having independence, and experimenting. Religious beliefs are important would you not agree? Certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind. Such as gay rights. This may apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it. For the ones who do accept it, you can tell they are open minded. Unlike the rebels going against it that is their own state of mind. I believe it is important you go along with your religious beliefs and what you feel is right. Independence is what we are or what we assume to have or already have. Whether the music, movies, magazines, etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you. Why? It is because you know what is right and wrong. So what if all the non sense things may have caught your attention. Should you take control and get rid of it? No. It does not bother you. You take it as it is, being independent and self-assured. Experimenting is self contained. As simple as it is you do it or do not. It is more than likey that people are/were under the influence. I, myself, have been in that situation before. I'm known to be the crazy child in the family. My dad would always lecture me about being careful with who I hang with when I'm out. As a teenager I let those words pass by me. I was always the youngest out of the people I hung out with. Was I ever under the influence? Yes. Did I ever get hurt? No. I can and will say I experimented with life and learned from it. Does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad? It usually varies. Religious beliefs, it may or may not be disrespectful. To have independence, you are the one in control. Experimenting, that is a choice on your own. What is offensive to me may not be to you. I have my own state of mind and so do you, and that is what makes us unique individuals.
1229	4206	2	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive mind grabbing, sexual contact in any of the story, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitting around, the radio for example, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with all the cussing and singing about money, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio, and adult books that are sitting around in stores ready to be read by adults, not children. The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there eight or nine years old looking at pornographic magazines, and movies. So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands where it can cause harm and confusion.
1230	4207	2	3	Banned books.'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work that I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, Author. I believe and will stand by Katherine's statement above. Who gets to say if a book is offensive? People have a right to their opinion, but I do not think any one has the right to take books away from a public library. Public library, the facts are in the name. It is a public library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on an school assignment, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offended someone does not makes sense to me. A person can pick up a book, be offended and complain about it, that is freedom of speech. I do not see fault in that. But when a person picks up a book, is offended, and demand that the book per se is taken off the shelves of a public library. That is when I have issues seeing where they think they have the right. Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Isn't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelf at his or her own will? I fear the out come of that. I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book if they looked hard enough. Taking books off the shelf is taking knowledge away from the people. We as citizens have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slightest whim to read, and be able to read that book without prosecution from a people that find the book in question 'offensive.' The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, is the day our first amendment fails. As a nation we need to stand strong against banning books from public libraries. For our generation and for the many generations to follow, we must protect this fundamental freedom.
1231	4208	2	3	One subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion. I personally disagree with the concept. The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences. Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion. Society, at least in my native country and surely abroad in other democratic nations, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons. First, many countries have a Bill of Rights and priviledges upheld in the face of the law. Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public. The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the Bill of Rights, resulted. Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries. The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar. We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the Declaration of Independence if so required of us to continue doing just that. Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society. I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship. 'Fahrenheit 451,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens. '1984,' by George Orwell, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent Big Brother, who utilizes omnicient surveillance even though I have not read the composition myself. 'Little Brother,' a recent novel by Cory Doctorow whose title employs a pun on the name of 1984's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar. All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization. In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship may result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method. In any case, a more effective solution must exist today. To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place. Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity. The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces. Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings. Different regions utilize different systems, but that of the ESRB, or the Entertainment Software Rating Board for the United States, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe. As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all. Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor. Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years. Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset. It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose.
1232	4209	2	3	The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art. They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself. Censorship is the underlying problem to many things. It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion- emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are conveyed in books and films. If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth. Many people can only express themselves in their art- and art can be very real. So real that we don't think that it's possible. We don't want to believe something like 'The Destructors' could happen. 'The Destructors' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home. Because this man is very rich, he has lots of material wealth. Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it. Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries. But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house. Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy. It is this that makes us think, and therein lies the problems with censorship. If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves. The loss of books has been seen throughout history. Most prominantly, the nazi regime. In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the nazi ideals. The censorship escalated into the nazis burning books in large piles. This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset. The movement swelled and the German people soon developed a national pride and goal. By the 1930's, nearly every German who could read had read 'Mein Kampf'. The censorship had turned into an all-out war on classical literature and the promotion of nazi ideas. That was how Hitler was actually voted in. Many don't realize, but the German people actually did vote Hitler to be leader. Now that the nazis had destroyed the publics ideals, they were replaced with the nazi's own. The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge. The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates. If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words. The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are. Censorship has never ended in something good- only the promotion of something bad. If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own.
1233	4210	2	3	What I think about that is that you have your own thoughts about a book, just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others won't. There may be something that you like in a book that you don't like in a movie, and there may be something that you like in a movie that others may not like in a book that doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelf. Personal taste is subjective and varies greatly from one individual to another. About magazines if there are things in a magazine that you don't want to look at or have your children look at then yes they should be taken off the shelf I mean come on now it's a libary there should be certain things that are up there that's al I'm saying. Ultimately, the decision of what to read should rest with the individual or, in the case of children, their parents, rather than being a matter for blanket censorship that affects everyone.
1234	4211	2	3	There are many different things in the media that is shown everyday that is very offensive. Im sure everyone can honestly say that they've watched or heard atleast one thing in the media that they got offended by. Also people need to remember that this is a free country, and everyone has freedom of speech. None of the television company's, or radio stations should get in trouble, because it's freedom of speech. I don't get offended by anything I read, listen to, anything on t.v. I really don't see how people can get offended by any of it, because it's not like anything is being directly said to that person who's offended. I have heard of people trying to sue record company's for songs that they found offensive. I think that is rediculous to try to sue someone just because you got offended by it. It's not the record company's fault if you took offense to it, and there is no reason why a fan should have to suffer because of a reason like that. The principle of free expression is foundational, and legal action in response to mere offense undermines that very principle for everyone.
1235	4212	2	3	Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people. When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive, what may seem offensive to you may not be offensive to anyone else. Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you may be completely something else in someone elses eyes. How many humans inhabit the world today? About six billion, researchers say. If you think about it, each and every one of those six billion minds thinks differently. If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant, it is like taking away a person's ability to learn. In the world today, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved. What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world. For all you know, the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer. How could you just take that away? Again, the magazine could be offensive to a person who may have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured? Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away? If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people, we might as well just take all the books, movies, magazines, and comics away that have ever been created. Once again, something that may be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person, because about six billion minds do not all think alike. If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive, our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well.
1236	4213	2	3	Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world, forming the foundation of our collective identity. Libraries are places that house these very things for the enjoyment and education of all who visit them. This is why I believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraries offer this to people freely! How can one take that freedom away from another? Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occurred in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the Holocaust, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings in history offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth from anyone. Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the true question is, 'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing the divinity of Jesus in the Christian religion is offensive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose beliefs directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material because their purpose is to hold all knowledge and not just what people want to know. How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occurred in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people of potential solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man, and we should not attempt to control its narrative now. In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured and protected from any form of suppression.
1237	4214	2	3	People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want, but parents or other family members often tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their parents or not. If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it to protect them. We need to have clear rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in their lives from a young age. Adults have the right and responsibility to keep children away from this information. Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library for this very reason. Children and adults both have their own sections as well as teens. These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to, within reason. I believe that if we make the sections have a strict age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can read this information at any time without guidance. Adults can eliminate this risk with proper oversight. Children in libraries should be supervised by a guardian. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material can give off bad information to a child who is not mature enough. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex from books alone. Parents should be the first to tell their child about sex in an appropriate manner. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful, but detailed stories can glamorize them. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnancy as well. Learning about pregnancy makes them think about how that women got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children, leading to confusion. Children can also read or listen to material about gun violence. Children read about gangs and think that it is cool or exciting. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children without context. After some children read about it they get their friends involved. This information can spread across the school quickly. Violence is very harmful for children's development. Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read, but they are in control of its access. If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands. They should be able to have strict limits on age appropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections that they might find harmful information should be closed to young children without an adult. Children in libraries should be supervised at all times. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnancy should not be allowed for children to read freely. Violence in books seem to spread across schools, influencing behavior. Adults can help prevent this harmful information from reaching all children by supporting these necessary restrictions.
1238	4215	2	3	I think that there should be rooms where certain adult books are located, separated from general collections. I think that they should have to be of age to get the books in that section to ensure maturity. I feel strongly that libraries should have every different kind of book for anyone who seeks them. Everyone goes to a library so I think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books available. If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come there and check the book out for them, providing consent. I think that libraries are for everyone in a community and that not everyone reads and looks at good nice books; some look at naughty books and they should have the right to go and check out books like that in a controlled manner. When you go to a library you should be able to go there and get whatever genre that you want and there be no restrictions for adults, but with safeguards for the young. I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it, showing identification if needed. My conclusion is, if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at as an adult. You should be of age for romance novels and derogatory books but for the library itself, they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions for those who are legally permitted to access them, thus balancing freedom with responsibility.
1239	4216	2	3	What do we find offensive? This is a question with no single answer. In a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone, depending on their personal beliefs and experiences. For example with movies there are horror, sci-fi, comedy, romance, adventure, etc. and all of them are offensive to someone somewhere. If we were to take down all of the movies that are offensive to a single person, all the movies would be taken off the shelves eventually. Should we take all things that are offensive to us off the shelves, or leave them so people who do enjoy them can? I believe that we should leave these materials alone for the benefit of the whole community. It should not be right for us to choose what a public library should and shouldn't have on their shelves based on individual sensitivity. If a person finds an item offensive, then they should ignore it and move on, not make a big deal of it for everyone else. Many people learn to keep their opinions to themselves but some do not, causing unnecessary conflict. People who judge by what they don't like, tend to make themselves known, but that does not mean they should dictate access for all. A library's collection should reflect diverse viewpoints, not just inoffensive ones.
1240	4217	2	3	Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of a modern society, eroding our fundamental liberties. Our lives have been taken over by political correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own, but are filtered through a lens of acceptable discourse. Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media. But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned and removed from public view. Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our rights as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media worth consuming. The Constitution of the United States, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech. Censorship actively and violently violates that sacred right. Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away piece by piece. Our own words are forced down our throats, never allowed to come out into the open. Censorship ensures that no challenging opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves. Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech? We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say. We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them. Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form and evolve. Arguments come, but these arguments allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives. We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions. And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with ideas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance. But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone, which is an impossible goal. But there will always be someone who is unhappy with any given idea. It's the inevitable truth of a diverse population. Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world, creating a false reality. In a way this makes sense from a protective standpoint. We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life immediately. We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors before they are ready. However, if we don't allow people to open these doors eventually, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come. Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them. For example, let's look at the issue of rape. Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens in our world. It is a nasty part of reality that must be confronted. Rape can be censored from books, television, and other forms of media. We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist. But that doesn't accomplish anything meaningful. That doesn't get rid of rape. It still exists as a tragic fact. And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop? How will a rape ever be able to be prevented? How will someone know what to expect or what to do? By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about its signs and consequences. Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped and survivors are to be supported. Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it; it only makes us more vulnerable. Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't in the long run. It hurts the people, cutting off their access to crucial knowledge. We as people need knowledge to survive and thrive. We live off of knowledge, it is the fuel for progress. And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media and open discourse. Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually, like death by a thousand cuts. It may not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp. Is this fair to future generations? Is this right for a free society? Is this helping us grow? How does cutting out knowledge ever help a society advance? It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear what we do not understand. It is human nature to fear the unknown. The more that becomes unknown due to censorship, the more we have to fear in our lives. Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in a complex society. This is wrong and immoral on a fundamental level. It is unfair, if nothing else, to limit human understanding. We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists, to read and learn without barriers. No good comes from hiding it away in the dark. Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways, creating ignorance and division. And as time goes on it can only get worse if left unchecked. Censorship is based off of offensiveness, a subjective and fluid concept. If something could be offensive to anyone, it is disposed of without a second thought. However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone, somewhere. Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the ultimate goal of censorship, which is an impossible and dystopian standard. This means all media of any kind should be destroyed to avoid any possible offense. No one should say anything for fear of causing upset. The world would be forced into a silent, sterile existence. All knowledge would be taken away, leaving a vacuum. Chaos would ensue as people fight over the remnants of free thought. The people's freedom would be completely taken away, extinguished. The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes, lost forever. This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue its march. We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship, to have our thoughts policed. Yes, people's feelings will be hurt sometimes, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings, as those feelings are temporary while knowledge is permanent. These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away from us and our children. Censorship is taking away our freedoms and rights, slowly stealing them away from us without most people even noticing. It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never
1241	4218	2	3	Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelf. People might need those materials for academic research or if they just want to find out about something for themselves. If the material is offensive to someone they can report it to a librarian, but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it if the material does not violate policy. The people that find something offensive could also simply ignore it and walk away, allowing others to access it. If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it. I might look at it briefly to see what it says but I would not say anything about it or demand its removal. There are some people, like students or scholars, that would have to look at that very material for research or something else important. So why get it removed from the shelf for everyone? I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but, if I did then I would not say anything and just move on. Now some people would say something but, what if you walked in a library looking for a specific book for your research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive? What would you do then? Yes you could get on the internet but, it might not have what you are looking for exactly or the specific details you need. I have had a lot of research papers throughout my schooling. There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research topic. I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up. When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything before my session ended. I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late, which affected my grade. Computers are good for looking up stuff, but when you have a specific book in mind that would give you a lot of detailed information, you go for the book not the computer. I know there are materials that are offensive to people. I know people get mad at them but, it is not the library's fault for providing a diverse collection. They most likely have to have those materials on the shelf because that is what's required of them by their collection development policy. So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it, which is the most practical solution for everyone involved.
1242	4219	2	3	To whom it may concern, everyone in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It might be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis that they find disagreeable. Be that as it may, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws and differing viewpoints. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities and interests. Katherine Paterson's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' This is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should have some censorship, but only up to a specific point and not beyond. We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child, which they hope to instill. What might be offensive to one parent may not be to another. If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother may not mind it at all. The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else; she could say she wanted this book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book she finds problematic. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right in this observation. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone when tastes and morals vary so greatly? Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual with a different background. I have dealt with situations like this before; everyone has at some point. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not always agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash occasionally. Everyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person may not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left for anyone to enjoy. The library shelves would be completely empty, defeating the purpose of the institution. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point for extreme cases. Taking into account everyone's diversification in this world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed after careful consideration. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the past that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people in the community, it should not be in a public library where it causes widespread distress. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics that divide people. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing, especially children. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will without a formal process. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there, which is not ideal either. When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment and enrichment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that might offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their personal morals. Everyone is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point where harm is evident. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everyday with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them when they disagree with us. Everyone wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate for ourselves. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount of censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing for intellectual freedom. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left for anyone to use or discover. After all, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty due to overzealous censorship. Thank you for considering this perspective on a complex issue.
1243	4220	2	3	Libraries are meant for all types of books, movies, music, and magazines. It gives you a variety of things to look at or even check out for personal use. An offensive book or movie or even music shouldn't be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad things in it that some people dislike. People may or may not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion on such matters. Through my own experiences, observations, and the reading I have done, I will help and explain my own opinion in why I don't think offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf entirely. If a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf permanently. Somebody most likely worked hard on that book so it could be put on to the shelf for the public to access. If you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what types of books are in that section, like a mature readers section. I have not had any real personal experiences with this but I know librarians are aware of what are in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything highly offensive next to a childrens book as a general practice. Same thing with music and movies. Music is music and it is there to be listened to by those who choose it. People like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they don't like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf for everyone else. Movies usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than don't pick it up; it is a simple choice. If it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you on the packaging or be put in a different section of the library. For instance at my old library where I used to live, they would put all rated R movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be seventeen or older or have a parent with you to approve it. It is really all up to the person, they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice for themselves. It's not the libraries fault if you pick up an offensive book because well, you should have some common sense about what you select. The libraries shouldn't have to take offensive things off the shelves because some people lack common sense or just don't know what they are doing when they browse. They could make more of an effort to kind of separate bad from good, wrong from right, and even appropriate to non appropriate through better organization and labeling. But it is usually all up to the person making that decision on what to check out, as they are responsible for their own choices and those of their children.
1244	4221	2	3	I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a separate room just for grown ups, containing more mature material. In the Dunkirk library there is a room that has just adult books and the kids cannot go in there with out a parent accompanying them. So whenever you go in there your parents are with you to supervise. But I don't think you can check them out if you are underage without consent. But if I had a kid I would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older so I think there should be separate rooms for different age groups. So whenever they got older and matured they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them when they are ready. But on the other hand why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not there gonna see it other places or from other people then they go home asking there mom what this means and stuff; why not let them learn on their own from a book in a controlled environment? There are some people that would agree with that but then there are people that would disagree with that approach entirely. So maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go in them whenever you want if you meet the age requirement, or maybe there should be rules that you can't go in there without a parent present to guide you. I don't know what the perfect solution is; maybe there should be a vote between people in the community if they like the idea or not. But some people would be mad over that outcome so if you chose one option someone would not like it or something like that, as it is hard to please everyone. My opinion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on their own when they are curious, as sheltering them completely may not be the best approach. Some people would think I'm a bad parent for this view but would you want you child to find out somewhere else without any context or guidance at all?
1245	4222	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a freedom to read and the freedom to write that must be considered. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie, and that purpose should be respected. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it that they find valuable. The freedom of speech gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind without fear of suppression. That freedom allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie, sharing their perspective. Sure there may be some parts that may be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate or without merit. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all, showing how subjective offense can be. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you may think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself why you feel that way? Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the freedom to write, a fundamental right. With that you can't be told not to do so by others who disagree. For example, the 'Cosmopolitan' magazine maybe offensive to an abundant number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at in the first place. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy or to discuss relationships. It's not meant to be offensive to anyone and that company has the freedom of the press to publish such a thing for its target audience. The freedom to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in
1246	4223	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, and music are all good to read, watch, or listen to for entertainment and enrichment. When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes, I wonder how people come up with these creative ideas. The real reason I question why people listen to music, read books, and watch movies is because some content can be so offensive. In today's world, you have music with all this negative stuff about people, talking about people with curse words; it's not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to it. I feel that such material should not be allowed on the shelves and it should be removed. Parents don't want their little children hearing that negative music, fearing that when they grow up they are going to imitate the behaviors because everybody sings their songs and everything else. Conversely, I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves. The reason I say this is because movies are funny, scary, sad, and more. Sometimes you need the offensive elements in a movie; without that, it would not be good most of the time. One of my favorite films is @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and it was about characters from the past, @CAPS1 and @CAPS4, getting back together to do one more mission. That movie was offensive, but you still have a good time watching it because it has the nice cars and good characters. Movies should never get removed from the shelves because without the edge that offensive content sometimes provides, it would not be as fun. People could not go to the movies with their friends and have a good time. If you are taking little kids out, make sure you pick the right movies for them. To conclude my argument, music is not a bad thing to listen to because you have good music too, but all I'm saying is make sure to watch what you listen to so you avoid getting in trouble trying to do what they say in their songs. As for the movies, keep coming out with good films and keep making the movies enjoyable for everyone.
1247	4224	2	3	People go to the library to find certain types of material for research, education, or personal enjoyment. Some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed from circulation. However, certain materials should not be removed if found offensive to others because it might not be offensive to someone else that might enjoy it or find it valuable. The offensive material can be history that the world needs to know, such as accounts of racism and injustice. If people did not know the importance of slavery, for instance, they wouldn't know of the past life and why we are treated the way we are being treated today. History is a big part of life that everyone should know, which is why we have history class to let us know of the history that we've been through. That said, all material doesn't have to be history that is offensive. Some material has depictions of sex and violence that is offensive to many. The libraries should have clear labels on every section to let people know what type of material it is, providing a warning. If people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it, then they get what they ask for and it shouldn't be removed simply because they didn't like it. I learned in history class about wars that had violence in them, which some of my classmates didn't like, but that's what happened and we needed to know the truth. Materials are made for a reason, whether to inform, to tell a story, or to provoke thought. They should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another. I read books in school with all kinds of violence and other things people @MONTH1 not like, but it's history. History makes a difference in our lives and it's what we need to understand our world. You cannot remove that. If you find it offensive, just don't view that material again and choose something else that suits your sensibilities.
1248	4225	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed simply because they are found to be really offensive by some. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean that it would be to another person. Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two, but not everyone. So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelves because who is really going to be offended by it, and are they truly offended by this entire matter or just one aspect? Also, I believe that some people might lie about being offended by it just so that they will have it taken off the shelf. Maybe there is a movie, for example, that has a lot of bad words; I could see them being able to take that off the shelf because a lot of people don't like those words to be used, and that's understandable. However, if they are just taking it off the shelf for one little thing, I don't think that should be allowed. I think that if a person is getting offended by what a book said or a movie said, then they should simply choose not to read it or watch it. Nobody is forcing you to watch or read something that you do not want to. Reading a book and watching a certain movie is all up to you and your personal choice, not what others say you should do. I believe that this really comes down to what a person's individual beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day, which means that they probably aren't going to be watching the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. They are going to pick a movie more suitable to their lifestyle and what they are used to. Maybe they had a friend that suggested they watch a movie and they did, and they might have taken offensiveness to it, but that was also their choice; they didn't have to watch it. If it were standard practice to take a book, movie, or music out because someone was offended, then there would be nothing left on the shelves. Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said 'this book offended me, I want you to take it off the shelf'? I'm sorry, but I'm having a hard time believing that you're going to listen to every single person that comes in and says that. Also, @CAPS3, how do you know it was offensive to them? Are you going to have them show you what the specific problem was with this book? My guess is no, because you wouldn't want to deal with that many people complaining about one or two, or maybe even five, books. I'm not saying that people don't get offended by some things that books and movies say, but you're going to have a lot more than just one person come in, and they will say that there is more than just one book or movie they find problematic, so then there would be no books left. What if you have someone come in and they request a certain movie and you say, '@CAPS4, I'm sorry we had to take that movie off the shelf because it offended someone'? I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy, and you will have some explaining to do. Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down, and they say that it was a very nice movie; are you going to listen to them also? If you listen to one person, don't you think it's fair to listen to the other person who likes the movie? I am a person that believes there are two sides to every story. Therefore, I think you should listen to both sides, or simply keep what you have; if that one person wants to take it off the shelf, then perhaps don't, but if someone asks for that specific item, then I would let them have it because that isn't going to hurt the person that got offended by the book or movie, is it? Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies, and music all on the shelves unless more than one person consistently complains, then it would be a different story worth considering.
1249	4226	2	3	Movies are to popcorn as music is to headphones; they are classic pairings for entertainment. Right? It is all fun and games until someone's innocence is completely destroyed by the content within. The simplest forms of entertainment are being manipulated by today's world, which often prioritizes shock value. Many of the children in our modern society are quickly becoming conditioned and used to seeing and reacting to media found in the everyday store, shop, or library. The innocence of the youth today is slowly being eroded by the subliminal messages found in music, magazines, and movies. These messages are frequently the same across each type of media: they glorify sex, drugs, and violence. The world of music has evolved tremendously over the past decades. We have moved from jazz, disco, funk, and rock to hard rock and hip-hop/rap, with each type belonging to a certain decade. But in our current era, the music industry is exploding with rap and hip-hop music. This type of music is often triggered towards the three ideas of sex, drugs, and violence. Almost every song that is heard today on the radio or on your iPod will most likely have something to do with one of those three themes. The sense of being so naive and so innocent is broken after listening to these songs every time the radio is on. The youth does not need to be listening to this whatsoever, and therefore, parents should be more aware about what their children are listening to and should think more carefully about the effects that the media has on them. Recently, more and more people are turning to articles and segments in magazines to read instead of the 'good old fashioned' novels. The novels that were written before our era are generally clean and nonexplicit. But today, literature has gone down a new course. More and more, @ORGANIZATION1 companies are becoming less traditional and more upfront about topics that are sexual, violent, or drug related. For example, in @ORGANIZATION1, you will see articles strictly pertaining to sex-like actions. Possibly on the other side of the page, you will see an ad for @CAPS1 cigarettes. Soon enough, kids are going to think that everything they are seeing and looking at will be acceptable and may soon act upon it. The libraries that are offering these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these publications. There has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies. Movies are a timeless object of entertainment for many. But recently, the subtle or blunt 'hints' of sex, drugs, and violence are portrayed in almost all movies offered in the box office today. There have been those action-packed movies where there is all the fighting and the blood and the punching. Then there are the sappy romantic movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions. These types of movies are offered in libraries nationwide and are easily accessible to children. The youth of our country do not need to be seeing all of these actions and hearing these messages, as in no way, shape, or form is this morally correct for their development. All in all, library censorship is very weak and often ineffective. The people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked. The more times a child reads, listens, or watches media with subliminal or blunt messages about sex, drugs, and violence, the more they are going to think it is okay to act and do these actions themselves. All sense of innocence is destroyed, and children are not children anymore; they are prematurely exposed to adult complexities.
1250	4227	2	3	Why would you ever censor anything in a library, a place dedicated to knowledge and access? Apparently, it is because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., can be found offensive by some patrons. If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if it's going to be open to anyone in the public, including children? This is a valid concern that requires a balanced approach. First off, censorship is important in some contexts, but we don't necessarily need it in libraries of all places. Libraries are institutions where all sorts of literature and media come together in one place where they can be seen and experienced by those who admire them. Censorship stops this by pulling books off shelves simply because they are considered offensive by a few. If a book is deemed offensive, the first step should be to decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to. Then, decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience. If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then perhaps it should be pulled off the shelves of a library, but this is a drastic measure. Otherwise, it should be placed in the adult section of the library where access can be managed. Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature and media. As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult age, it should be placed in a designated adult section. Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section where they are appropriate. You can even have a separate section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers, bridging the gap between children's and adult content. Sections in a library almost completely defeat the need for outright censorship. These sections help correctly place books and other literature in a library so that only readers of certain suitable ages @MONTH1 read them, allowing for personal choice while providing guidance. In conclusion, using sections in a library can be an effective strategy instead of resorting to censorship. If we were to censor every book that someone found offensive on the shelves in a library, then eventually there would hardly be any books left for anybody to enjoy. Sections help keep a wide variety of books in a library, but they keep them in a designated place where the right audience can view them responsibly, thus preserving access and choice.
1251	4228	2	3	As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to an extent, primarily to align with educational guidelines and age-appropriateness. With our school library being censored I do not feel that the public library should be. Why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion; every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored for their specific age group; I feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your guardian, but also the library itself has control over what they find age appropriate through its organizational systems.  If disliking the book is a problem; then simply put it back on the shelf. Find something more common towards your own interest. Some things may be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this. While someone might dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth, another may find it inspiring. If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves; as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote about the dangers of subjective censorship.  When you enter a public library; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, ect.. When you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author. Censorship amoung public libraries is not needed. Adults, students, and childeren all go to a public library for different reasons. So, as the case may be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages. I feel that yes an elementary, or middle school library should not contain the same content as a high school library. But a public library, is for the entire public. Hints the name.  In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. So as the fact may be that some things may seem innappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group with their own unique needs and perspectives.
1252	4229	2	3	I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries, except for things such as complete smut and pornography, which serve no real literary or educational purpose. However there are many different beliefs on this subject. Some parents might think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more forgiving and trust in their child's judgement.  The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are. A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false. Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs. The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it. Reading one book with a couple curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child, because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life. It might even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises, seeking out the very content you tried to hide.  I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, and sex novels, racist books, ect. Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers, and quit treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad' things out there. Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world. If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it, they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive' books, which often provide valuable life lessons.
1253	4230	2	3	Offensive material. Material. Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals. Is it right to have all types of material shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this material contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming material should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home.  Even though some people may not take offense to any type of material, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this material brings. Some content may not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements and understand the context.  Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the material contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree with its themes.  A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended.  Material can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community and its youngest members.
1254	4231	2	3	The book called The Contender. the book is about a young African-American man that starts school at a new high school. While the first few weeks in school he is picked on and made fun of. So one day he decides to join a boxing class, and the wreslting team at his school. But at the end of the book he ends up fighting everybody the was bullin him and ultimately finds his own path and self-respect.  I personaly the book should be kept on the self because its a life changing expersance for a young man, showing a journey of perseverance and personal growth. For some people this book they will or have even read this book several times, I know I have. I only hope that othere people will like or even love this book as much as I have, finding value in its story and message.  So I guess what I am trying to say is you really never know what you are going to like in till us sit there and read it from beganing to the end, allowing the story to fully unfold and reveal its deeper meaning and impact on the reader.
1255	4232	2	3	When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up from pure imagination. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section for such content.  To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest and explore different perspectives. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others might not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one for a moment.  Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section, perhaps with a simple age restriction or advisory notice. It might cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already so this would be a logical extension.  Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of materials from shelves. There might be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they might get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it, which seems an unfair punishment.  In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea to balance access with responsibility.
1256	4233	2	3	All terms of offense are based on an individual opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, that doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way about it. Some parents aren't as strict on their kids as others are, and some just don't care about monitoring content. Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really don't need to be listening to. Then there are the horror movies that are rated 'R' for a reason, as they could cause a child to have nightmares for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still can't tell what is real and what is not real. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, how to act, what to do, and even what to think. Children just aren't mature enough to handle a majority of the material in this world. No books should be taken away or hidden from society; it should just be given to you at your own discretion when you are ready. Another possibility would be to have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particular material. All information is helpful in its own context, just not all of it is necessary for a child. These days it is hard to hide all harmful material from children, and even from some teenagers. This world is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. Eventually everyone will be completely insensitive to all the 'harmful' movies, books, magazines, television shows, and music. It won't even phase anyone anymore, and the concept of offense will have changed entirely.
1257	4234	2	3	Censorship in libraries is something good to have and something bad to have; it is a double-edged sword. I think that there could be some things adults can read and some things kids can read, a natural separation. You don't want the kids reading anything that's too mature for them right? Libraries are found all over the country. A lot of people say, 'Well, they shouldn't even have the book there in the first place.' But think about this, maybe you should just have your kid under control and watch what they read. Or option two, don't have your kid go to a public library. Public, which let me explain, is for the public. Which means the whole community can go pick out something they want. A public library is supposed to have a wide variety so anybody can find a book they would like to read. Yes, some things are very inappropriate for kids, but that doesn't mean we can't have it in a public library. Just make sure that you know what your kid is reading. If you do that you should be fine, and your kid will be the same, unharmed by the broader collection. That's how I feel about censorship in a library. It's public, so it's meant to have everything for everyone. Which everything includes the good and the bad. I think some people just have to live with it, as that is the nature of a shared community space. So I honestly feel that libraries, for the way they are, are to be left alone to serve their entire community.
1258	4235	2	3	Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs and backgrounds take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas or challenge their worldview. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it; they can choose to look away. Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for, which is freedom of expression. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read? Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be almost nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book if they look hard enough. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing, and offensive but that doesn't give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves for everyone else. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem of differing opinions. I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative and less open society. There are many people who actually want to read a book but never get the chance just because it is censored from the library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination and encourage new thoughts. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity and independent thought?
1259	4236	2	3	To be honest, if I was a librarian I would leave them up on the shelves according to what the state law would have to say about the matter. If the state doesn't have any problems with having them up on the shelves, then all student body will be able to check them out freely. Having magazines available shows what is new in the world and what is not, keeping students informed. Also, just like checking out a book where you have to take a test over it called reading counts, a similar process could be used. Then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and write an essay over it, demonstrating comprehension. You would then submit it to whomever is in charge of that department for grading and discussion, ensuring the material is being engaged with thoughtfully and academically.
1260	4237	2	3	Many things such as books, music, magazines, etc., cause problem acts for children to act different, but I say that everything should stay in the library because there are more things that cause acts than just the things that are listed. Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines but most get their acts from something different entirely. Children get most of their acts from the television that they're viewing at home, which causes them to think if their parents don't care about what they're watching then it's okay to view whatever they want. So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies, not necessarily in the library. So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch whatever is legal on television. But to me, in the libraries, it's up to whomever is controlling it to decide by ages what is appropriate. Just like legal things are only legal for adults, some content is only for adults. I say that it's only for adults because children start arguments from whatever they see, especially when they're around their friends. When children are around their friends they feel that it's cool to do whatever they see. And it's all coming from things based on violence in the books that children read more often. So to me I will say that it shouldn't be okay for just anything to be viewed by anyone without some consideration for age and maturity.
1261	4238	2	3	I have read a few books that I don't approve of, books with content I find inappropriate. And I feel that yes, I do have a right to want to remove these books from the shelves. But who's to say what I think should have an effect on everyone else? Honestly, I do not think that books should be taken off the shelves or music should be banned, etcetera. I think that there should be a little more authority on the age limit of books in libraries, and a separate, designated place for music and other things of that nature. I would not want my kid to walk out of the library with a book about explicit sex, violent gangs, or stuff that should not be known by a kid at a young age. Instead of banning or removing these kinds of books off shelves, why not put a strict, enforced age limit on books, and actually stand by it. Yes, there is an adult section and a kids section, etc., but I've seen so many young kids walking out with books, magazines, and other adult items that are clearly not meant for them. I know how it feels to try and concentrate on a book, newspaper, or magazine you are interested in when people are blaring their headphones, disturbing the peace. And I still feel the same way about the music as I do with books. Don't ban it from the library; just ban it from certain, specific areas of the library, like the reading rooms. It's all out of respect to people who are wanting to be in a quiet area to study or read. I'm not the type of person who wants to take things away from people because everyone has their own interests and beliefs in life, but I am one who believes in setting clear rules that should be followed by all patrons. I see good coming out of everything a library has to offer if only they could exclude things in certain areas to maintain order and a proper environment. And also, they should set and firmly stand by the age limits of the books being checked out to protect younger readers.
1262	4239	2	3	They should be allowed to be removed because some books are offensive and contain harsh material. Even if they are offensive, they can teach young teenagers about their past and the realities of history. The books could be about the KKK or the Nazi regime, detailing their ideologies and actions. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went through during those difficult times. The books could also be a school assignment for a history or social studies class. The way I see it is if your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past, you should allow them to read what they want to satisfy their curiosity and education. Some books such as historical novels, war biographies, and classic literature are great to read for school assignments. These history books are very helpful to read because you can learn about your own history and about the wars at the same time, gaining a broader perspective. I think if your child checks a book out from the library, he or she should return it in a week to ensure it's available for others. The library should give the child a certain, specific amount of time to return the book, like a one-week loan period. If the child does not return the book in that amount of time, they should charge them a small fee for every day it is late. If the book is damaged, they should charge whoever checked that book out for the repair or replacement cost. The book should be in the same condition it was in when it left the library so other people can check it out after it's returned and enjoy it. The library should keep certain important books always available at the library, such as the Bible and essential college textbooks. The library should allow a limited number of history books to each person, perhaps just one or two. Instead of three or four, this would keep more books on the shelves for everyone to share. It would also keep people from losing so many books if they only have a few at a time. I think people under twenty-one years old should not be allowed to check out R-rated movies or explicit music. I think they should have to show I.D. to prove they are over twenty-one before borrowing such materials. There should be more rules then just being quiet in the library; they should make people start keeping some reference books at the library and only allow them to take home fiction or history books. For instance, I check out a fiction book every week and return the previous one I checked out the same day I go to get a new one. I only check out the book I really want to read, and I read it and return it promptly. The magazines should never be checked out; they should remain in the library for everyone to browse.
1263	4240	2	3	I think they shouldn't be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opinions and personal tastes. One person might think a book is offensive, but the next person may not find it offensive at all. Some people might think any books with God or Jesus in them are offensive, but that might just be because it is not their religion or their system of belief. If every single person took off a book that they thought was offensive or objectionable, there would be no books left on the shelves for anyone to read. Because people think so differently about what is acceptable. Or some might not like the horror genre books because of the graphic violence and gory descriptions, but to some people, those are their favorite books for entertainment, so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others don't. There are many books out there that not everybody is going to like; the difference is simply how you think and what you personally think is right and wrong, which should not dictate the access for all.
1264	4241	2	3	Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem that needs addressing? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good of the community? People of different culture, background, and life could be profoundly affected by these articles in readings, finding either offense or value. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational and enlightening. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong for public consumption. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries as a practice? Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who, along with the readers who lose access. If it is said that every reading that comes off as offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them for people to learn from? Some people might take romances as being offensive or comedy or horror, based on their personal sensibilities. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of a difficult relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows what personal history influences these views? Opinions such as these would be not only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself, erasing valuable perspectives. People of different races and cultures will invariably have another opinion on the situation of censorship, as their experiences differ. From all over the world, there are cultures spreading throughout our communities, bringing diverse viewpoints. Being born into a specific religion could be a huge effect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie, shaping their interpretation. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a culture might be difficult for some people of that culture to take in, evoking painful memories. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated at the portrayal. Only for others, it is an opportunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that terrible time. To support the people who made it through those heart-breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life, fostering empathy. Have you seen protests arise before you, perhaps at a city council meeting or a school board hearing? Anywhere in the world, these debates occur. On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper, the arguments are widespread. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person, demanding removal of materials. There have been protests in the past over the freedoms of a person or even an entire race, fighting for representation. If everyone begins to complain and argue about what is being put on shelves in libraries, where will it end? What will come of our world if we erase all challenging ideas? What will we know about the past if we sanitize it? What will we begin to predict for the future without a full understanding of history? Anyone, and even I, can make observations of the acts going on around us, seeing the push and pull of cultural expression. In my experience, I have seen attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television, facing backlash. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries based on personal discomfort? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience through media, which is understandable but not a basis for policy. Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished is firm. I believe the answer is no, it should not be practiced, because every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their lifetime from now on, it is inevitable. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else, offense is a personal reaction. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture and its recorded history, that there would be no complete history of life before us to learn from and build upon.
1265	4242	2	3	We as Americans have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws of the land. If they take away some books because they are racey or because some people find them morally wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the full, unvarnished history of our civilization. A great man once said 'Those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.' This quote is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured or difficult, we are taking that crucial history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lives, unable to learn the lessons. Taking away the content that is obscene or challenging will make our children unknowledgable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was, leaving them with a incomplete picture. 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' is under criticism because it uses the 'n-word' a lot in the text, which is considered offensive today. There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked, back in that day, and how things were done historically, reflecting the reality of the era. If they change the book, they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing that used dehumanizing language. When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how certain political groups are trying to change the past and how it is trying to nerf the children's history of what really happened, creating a softened narrative. Censorship should be on tv, movies, and music so the little kids don't see the wrong things too early, which is a form of age-appropriate protection, but when it comes to literature in the library, they shouldn't do it at all because only the literate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying, and they can process it. There should not be a censorship in the literature of the past, the present, and the future, as it is essential for a well-informed and thoughtful society.
1266	4243	2	3	In my way of viewing things, I say that what I think is that books, movies, music, and magazines should be put in a critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see, like the news that is in one way good to us. But some others like to see what's behind the reality and want to speak up, but they cannot because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So I think that those things—books, music, movies, magazines—should not be removed from the shelves because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how it is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that I have involve music; I had once heard a song in Spanish called 'Los Mandamás' and it talks about the corruption in our country and how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top who do not care about them. The song explains that if you treat them as kings, they will treat you as slaves, and that if you give them the power to control you, they will take advantage of it. It describes how honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but it is not enough because of the leaders on top who want everything for themselves. It is a very good song that says the truth about the situation and that nobody does something to finish it. So I do not want that songs or books that show the reality to disappear because some people do not like them at all. They serve as a vital mirror to our society, and their removal would silence important voices and perspectives that need to be heard for a fuller understanding of the world we live in.
1267	4244	2	3	I believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be publicized fairly. Just because one person's view is considered to be right, doesn't mean another is wrong. What is offensive to one person might be informative to another, offering a different perspective or a necessary truth. I've read a lot of books that parents might not pick out for their children. In reading these books, I see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law; instead, they often portray the harsh and unappealing consequences. For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they haven't experienced and help them find that they never want to go down that path. If a book is too explicit for children, simply place the book in another section, such as a restricted adult area. I realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and those should only be permitted to be checked out by adults. Parents should have concerns about their children's innocence, and I also believe that they should watch over what type of books their children are reading to monitor the vulgarity of them. Some music contains profanity or sexual innuendo, some contain praise and worship, others even have screaming. Any of these types of music can be found offensive by someone. That doesn't mean we should run off and hide all of them, because there'd be no music left for anyone to enjoy. Not everyone shares the same opinions in this world, therefore there should be equal opportunity for people to read, watch, or listen to whatever suits them. I'm not saying that there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are movies or books about shunned religions or beliefs then they should be just as welcomed as the ones about common religions and beliefs. Everyone finds different things offensive. If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be removed? It's one of the most popular books in the world, yet some people still find offense by it. Someone who is Mormon, Muslim, or atheist might find it offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find their beliefs offensive. The library is a place of knowledge, not judgement. I don't believe that certain books should be removed from the library if they offend someone. If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to, don't let them. Simple as that. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech; authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music, and this expression is a cornerstone of a free society.
1268	4245	2	3	I believe that if a book or other media has offensive language then it shouldn't be left on the shelf for unrestricted access. Also, it really does matter if it has offensive language because you don't know who, where, or when your child is going to learn offensive words. Another thing is that he's going to say any offensive words he picks up. Next, one of the most important things is that if you want your child to never have offensive language or any other bad thing, you should watch what you say and what you do around them. One reason why is because once he is growing up he might follow your footsteps and mimic your behavior. Another thing is that if the magazine, movie, book, etc., might have some racist content, like judging the person from where he or she comes from, how they look, or how they talk, it can end up in a bad situation by promoting harmful stereotypes. In conclusion, what I'm trying to say is that it's both the parents and the book because the book your child has chosen might have bad things, and the parents should watch themselves on how they act to provide a proper example and guidance for their children’s development and understanding of the world.
1269	4246	2	3	Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions negatively. The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the internet. It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material. One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about personal choices and individual responsibility. There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people might want to read or watch something with such content for educational or personal reasons. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to access such topics. Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropriate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left for anyone. People eventually will not be able to use libraries for their intended purpose. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that valuable resource. A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What might be offensive to one person might not be to another; offense is subjective. How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what is okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that. There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious. Censoring libraries is going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropriate and what is not, with no clear consensus. Eventually libraries will have nothing left to offer. Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices in life. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things in the long run. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong, equipping them to navigate the world responsibly.
1270	4247	2	3	I think censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be applied to people who have yet to mature, unless a parent or guardian approves of it for them. I think censorship can be a positive thing for little children and younger folk because kids that are young of age should not view or listen to things such as bad language or violent content. These things can be a negative influence on the child's character and personality, shaping their behavior in undesirable ways. No one should hear other kids cursing in public because this can influence other kids to do the same, creating a cycle of inappropriate behavior. I know my parents do not want to hear me say or do bad things around my younger siblings because this can influence them more to do it too than if some other kid was saying or doing bad things; the influence from family is often stronger. Some censorship shouldn't be applied to those who are matured, such as in high school where you might have to get a signature from a parent to see some things that should not be shown to little kids because older people have matured and they understand why not to be a bad influence on people and can process content more critically. Censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be removed from people that have yet to mature, unless with parent consent. People who have not matured should not view or listen to anything that is a negative influence on themselves, as their minds are still developing and forming their understanding of right and wrong.
1271	4248	2	3	Everyone loves to take their little children to the library and pick out all kinds of books to read, but what if your child picks up that one book that, let's say just isn't what you want them reading? Then what do you do? Take the book from them? Look for more and just let it be? Well you cannot blame the library for having the book. Or say you see books you do not like on the shelf at @ORGANIZATION1. Not only books but music or movies. Even if you find it offensive, someone else might not. It should not be a big issue at all because not everyone thinks alike; some of those books, music, or movies could have great information for others, and also every book, music, or movie has its purpose, although you may not see it every time it is something that you do not like. Wow, the world would be SO boring if everyone liked the same music, read the same books, or just watched the same movie over and over again. Everyone has the right to choose what they like and enjoy watching, reading or listening to. The libraries and stores also should have the right to put whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, some things are not appropriate for others, such as younger kids, but it does not matter. You as a parent should do your best to keep them away from those things you do not want them to see or hear, as that is your responsibility. Another thing is that just because you do not like something or think it is stupid does not mean that another person does not love it! Not your average teenage girl is going to want to read about building a house or listen to music from the @NUM1's, but does that mean that stores should not sell them? Everyone has a different taste, just like in music. Most younger kids these days are starting to listen to the fast rap music that their parents swear up and down you cannot understand. Although in reality some of those songs have great meaning to us teenagers, offering perspectives that resonate with our lives. Lastly every song, book, or movie has a meaning. Not everyone will see the meaning but it is there. Everyone has their own opinion. Libraries or stores should not take things off their shelves just because one person thinks that it is inappropriate, as this would limit the diverse range of ideas and stories available to everyone.
1272	4249	2	3	I believe that people should not be able to remove books, movies, magazines, etc. from the shelves of the libraries. If someone takes a movie, book or magazine as offensive they should contact the author of the piece and can complain or give their thoughts directly. Even if someone does find someone's work in a wrong way, people have their own opinions and thoughts about everything in life and are allowed to voice their beliefs and disbeliefs. Also, people can read on the front or back of other people's work which summarizes what the work is going to be about or what the work is talking about. People can decide then if they would like to read or watch further into it, making an informed choice for themselves. Everyone in this country is allowed to say what they think and if someone takes the time to get their voice published then others might want to hear what others think. People can disagree; no one has to agree with anything anyone says. It is alright to not agree with another person says but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation. For example if my coaches were to tell me that they think I'm doing something wrong in gymnastics or they think something doesn't look good when I do it, I let them speak. I let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points. Then after they're done talking I give my thoughts and say '@CAPS1 I think this because this' I try to reason with them. For one its more respectful and for two everyone can have their own thought about something. And who knows they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak. But, if you really don't like what another piece of work might say you can always not read what they wrote, or watch what they produced. There is no need to be rude. If you strongly disagree you can always write your own book or publish an article voicing your own thoughts, that way someone can disagree or agree with how you feel about a certain subject, creating a dialogue rather than a removal. That is why I feel that they should keep all books, magazines, movies on shelves. Everyone is allowed to express themselves and explain their actions toward a certain matter, and that freedom is fundamental to our society.  Sincerely,  @PERSON1.
1273	4250	2	3	To whom it may concern:  The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive. There are many things that could come off as 'offensive' to any individual. Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt that it did not go with their certain morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of speech. It also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas. This also shows that the library, or so far as the country, is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed, which is a dangerous path to follow.  One of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away. It may be something as trivial as '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it, then our freedom is taken away. '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' was brought up because a mother had actually gotten a certain book of the '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' @CAPS4 taken off the shelf, because her child had gotten scared of the halloween edition. The fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought. There weren't many cases of this specific @PERSON1 scene scaring all the kids, so there was no need to get it banned. When someone finds something even a tad wrong they want it banned and thrown away, never again allowed to be shown to those that might even find an interest in it, depriving them of that experience.  A big thing that may conflict with censorship is the idea of religion. The @CAPS5 is a published work, whether it is religious or not. Who's to say that it can't be banned? What if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive? This could cause even more conflicts between religious parties, and in turn anything religious would be banned all together. That small, faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship. If the @CAPS5 or works for catholics get banned, then so could published works for wiccans, muslims, buddhists, and any other sources of religion. There would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in. Not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works. It will then become a topic far less talked about, for they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion.  This censorship will only cause future issues. This could lead to not only the religious books being banned, but anything that strays from the social norms. If someone was homophobic, they might start having a gay author's works banned, or just a book about the @CAPS7 community banned. That small sense of security those in that community have in those books will be taken away. Personally, I find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books. There might even be a possibility that some books, not necessarily just @CAPS7 books, hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to. It is a world someone loves to enter, to hide or confide in. To take someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety.  Most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship. It may mean nothing, but those that decide whether or not to censor something have to think of the picture at large; Do they lose customers for keeping it on the shelf? Or do they lose customers, and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech? It is a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or legal party, and ultimately undermine the very principles of a free and open society.
1274	4251	2	3	Devin @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Do you like the library? There is always an argument about how books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive. Which brings me to @CAPS1 @CAPS2; there is always the choice of a different library to choose from. You also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie. Being an @CAPS3 author you have the freedom of speech, you can write whatever you feel like writing, and that is a right worth protecting.  First, is your choice of library. There are several different libraries in one town. Some have children's sections, where all the books are appropriate for young children to read. Also the parents of the children need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading, or looking at, guiding them towards suitable material. There has to be at least twenty to thirty libraries in @LOCATION1, so you always have a different option if one does not meet your needs.  Second, you don't have to read the book, or watch the movie. If you see something you don't like about the book, why complain about it? Just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book and find value in it. You have the freedom to pick out the book that is right for you, and to leave others for those who will appreciate them.  Last, is the freedom of speech of the author of the book. Being an @CAPS3 citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down. So people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down. Many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial, and removing them would be a loss to our culture. Where would we be without those books and authors who challenged the status quo?  I have given you three reasons on @CAPS1 view of censorship in libraries. You have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book, and the author has the freedom to write what they choose. These principles together form a strong case against the removal of materials and for the preservation of intellectual freedom for all.
1275	4252	2	3	Hiding @CAPS1? By: @PERSON1 Due to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person.  @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them, to decide what they can and cannot know.  Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the responsibility to know the past and use its lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self.  People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects disappear for another person? Confronting difficult truths is how we grow and improve.  In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the consequences of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day.  In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is responsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions, and to obscure that knowledge is to do a great disservice to humanity.
1276	4253	2	3	the author Ketherine Paterson is like letting you know like life is going to dont be behain go forword and grab the book from the shelf fot you and for your children because most of the book are gone because other people got them. I would go to the library and grab the book from the shelf for me and my kids. Mom can grad some good books for the kids like a book that have the parts of the body grammer so they can start learning something rite no that they are lilttle and they will ganna star to make sentences. For example, a simple picture book about the human body can help a young child learn the names of their eyes, nose, and mouth. in @DATE1 in warsaw school the principal decide to remove everything from the library because people didnt go and check out books, music, movies, megazines, etc he decide to remove them because people didnt check out nathing and most of the people put everything in obserbation but my question is why people didnt check out something for their kids so they can start to read to learn something from their moms school. Perhaps parents were too busy or did not realize the importance of early reading. in my opinion if i would the principal of the school i wouldnt take of the books nathing about the library i would live everything so they can grab the books from the shelf and check them out so the kids start to lear how to read they ganna learn something special from their mom, like sharing a story together before bedtime.
1277	4254	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development and understanding of the world around them. First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves and the struggles they faced. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating and the pain it causes. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner. Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path. In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1 due to poverty. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music. Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do for their cultural and emotional growth. In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right and limits their access to important knowledge and perspectives.
1278	4255	2	3	Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walk into a librarie and found something there that could had offended somebody. But thats just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person, like a book with strong political views or a magazine with graphic images. No, I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out, and not the job of the library to filter everything. Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it and move on to another book. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious or even educational. All I'm trying to say just do'n get all upset over something that you have read, because different people have different tastes and sensitivities, and a public library should serve everyone.
1279	4256	2	3	I believe books are writen for a reason and the words in the book goes with the whole point of the book is the words in the book are ment to be in the book. But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read. But no by far I think not letting people read the books that has offensive wording in it is kinda off silly because the author ment for it to be in there and if you change one word you kind of are changing the whole book and whats its trying to say and the author's original voice. But if some books are to offensive yes i believe it is good to not let people read but to take it off the market and exit the book and and try to resale it with a new edition. But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying something different but its not it is just worded differently. But i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market. Why I think its good to let books like this go on books that had offensive wording in it yes its worng but its also worng for the people who dont see it as being a offensive and enjoy the story as it is. Am sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didnt mean for it to hurt you. Am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding it could be about something that happend to them when they are little or just a word maybe they just dislike. But if they come across any word they dont like they should stop reading and choose another book that suits them better. I believe it is very unfare if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone dont like. But to others its does nothing to them. I think books that have a offensive wording should say somewhere like on the back of the book it should have a warning if it has any offensive working in it I think this would help out alot of people would start doing that, so readers can make an informed choice. This is really kind of silly because a book is a book and you should alway read about the story on the back of the book and if its a offensive and you dont like it that tells you not to buy the book. Dont always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it and the book might not be about flowers at all, it could be a mystery or a scary story. I really feel like am on both sides of this issue, seeing valid points for keeping books as they are and also for protecting readers from content that could cause them distress.
1280	4257	2	3	Libraries are a center of learning. They are there to provide all kinds of different information. So why should you take out offensive material? Even before internet, the all knowing source, people depended on the libarary for research and for finding new stories to enjoy. I do not think that things should be taken out of our library. Public libraries have always had a good censory about @CAPS1 they put on their shelves anyway, carefully selecting materials for their communities. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she is saying there is, everybody has a certain opinion, they @MONTH1 take offense to different things. Therefore, if anyone could have the right to take a book off the shelf that they found offensive, then we wouldn't have any books on our shelves, which would defeat the purpose of having a library. If we would travel back to the time where internet was not invented, there would not be a problem on whether we should take certain books off the shelf. That's all they depended on. For example, research and entertainment were both found within the library's walls. People today are spoiled. We can go right to a little screen and type in anything we want to know and we can find out just in mintues, sometimes even seconds. People don't even have to leave the house to go buy the latest movie that just came out, you can order it on the internet or even rent it from @ORGANIZATION1. If people are so worried about @CAPS1 is in the library, why don't they worry about all the explicit junk on the internet. Sometimes people can't see @CAPS1's right in front of them, focusing on a small number of books while ignoring the vast amount of unregulated content online. Everytime I go to the library and look through the books to find something to read, I rarely find a book that's worth questioning. Libraries are typically wholesome corporations, they have a good censory on @CAPS1 they let on their shelves. They've always had certain age group sections, and usually people and kids always stick to their age groups, like the children's section for young readers. Every book I have choosen too, I've read it cover to cover and found it to be worthwhile. In conclusion, libraries have been around for ever. Their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages. No matter if we ever had internet, we always had dependable libraries to turn to for reliable information and a quiet place to read.
1281	4258	2	3	I think that no movie, book, song, or any sort of music should ever be taken off the shelf. If you don't like what they say in these categories, don't watch, listen, read, or anything. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean somebody else doesn't. I mean, think about it: is there a movie or a song or a sentence that's so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf? I say no. Also, because somebody might have not got to read, see, or listen to that movie, song, or book, you know what I mean? Plus, consider all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song, book, or movie; it takes up to like almost two years for a movie to come out. And when a song comes out, you hardly even know it's new because they never tell you, like, to listen to Bullet For My Valentine's new song on the radio or anything. And when a new book comes out, it's usually like Harry Potter or something like that. But no, no movie should ever be taken off the shelves, nor book, nor music, nor magazine. It is a matter of personal choice and freedom of access for everyone.
1282	4259	2	3	There are certain books, games, and music that you and I know that shouldn't be in the library or stores on the shelves. One word that we should study is children. Children are the future; everything that happens in the future will be because of them. Now, with that done and said, I would like to explain and point out why we as people should overcome together and take books, music, and movies off the shelves. We see content involving drugs, crime, and violence in movies and other media. Rappers most of the time rap about females, killing people, and other negative themes. It doesn't mean that they do it, but it reflects on the majority of our children. Music is heard everyday for hours throughout television, radio, and iPods. It takes it to an even different level with the male gender, calling females out of their name and treating them how they were taught through music. If they are not listening to it, they are for sure watching it. A lot of the problems come from letting children watch the wrong rating movies. Rated R is what they are now letting children watch and buy, giving them a greater chance of failing in life. So now we are at two strikes with this stuff that we are allowing our children to pick up off a shelf. Another thing we let them pick up and grab is video games. A large percentage of our children play video games. While we can't stop them from making them, I strongly believe we can prevent children from buying them at an inappropriate age level. Most of the games are based on sex, drugs, violence, and bad language. At this point, children are taking it very seriously and strongly believing they can do the same, which leads to death or jail. Drug use, school dropouts, and crime rates are highly because of these same video games children are getting off the shelf, strongly influencing them to grow up fast and skip over their childhood life. So why can't we do something about it? I don't understand why we can't do it when we have the power to. It will help us out so much for everybody's future. Crime rates will go down, test scores will improve, and our future will be brighter for our sake and our children's sake.
1283	4260	2	3	Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you. You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf so you take it off. I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf. It isn't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazines, or many others. The authors have the right of freedom of speech, but it can go the other way around too. There are many reasons why, and I will explain this to you. The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place. I mean, if somebody walks into a library and tries to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one? A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offending. It was telling jokes about black people. I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe. The next reason is that it could cause the rating or reputation of the materials to go down. If somebody gets offended by a piece of material, they are going to report it and cause its standing to drop low. No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and that nobody wants. How would the author feel about their material getting reported because somebody was offended by it? If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it. The last reason is to get rid of the materials that cause offense. Nobody wants to look at something that offends them. How would you feel if you took a movie home to watch with the family and it had bad stuff in it that you didn't like? You get offended and complain. Complaining is bad for business, especially if it's a government building. If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems. I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if somebody is offended by it. The person might never return, the material's reputation could suffer, and removal prevents complaints. Now, what do you believe?
1284	4261	2	3	I believe that censorship within libraries and any other public media source is wrong, immoral, and unfair. Authors, artists, photographers, etc., have the right to freedom of speech. Why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? The censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it goes against basic American rights, but it also takes the responsibility, originality, and expression out of people's lives. If a parent or guardian did not wish for their child to be exposed to certain genres of certain media, isn't it their responsibility to intercept that from their child's environment? If a parent really abhors a certain genre, then it is up to that parent to create a surrounding in which they feel that their child is safe. It is understandable that some genres of music, magazines, books, and movies contain material that may be too graphic or mature for a reader of a certain age, but situations like this in today's world are unavoidable. In my experience, I know that when I was too young to understand the happenings of the world, my parents intercepted the stories from me. My parents turned off graphic or violent television when I walked in the room. They felt that this sort of material was inappropriate for someone at a young age, so they excerpted that material from my environment. When you become a parent, you take on responsibility for the life of another person. This responsibility includes the child's health, safety, and his/her surroundings. Why can't we leave the parenting of children to the parents? When children turn into teenagers and teenagers become adults, they earn many privileges. They earn the right to drive, then the right to vote, then the right to drink responsibly. There is a maturity level that goes into making decisions on your own; if you are mature enough to decide who you want to run your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as insignificant as music choice? Authors, artists, composers, and photographers, all by living in America, have the right to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. By censoring what products are published and put in public, we take away that right. Some may argue that the artists and authors still have the right to express themselves, but they are expressing material that is too risque or graphic to promote. This is an understandable point, but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote? Why should the government have total control over what people are exposed to? If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power-hungry politicians? Wouldn't America no longer be a democracy, but rather a communist country? America prides itself on being a 'melting pot' and being accepting. If America were to adopt such strict censorship, that would mean the restriction of expression and originality throughout the country. Would you really want to live in a country where originality isn't really original, and acceptance was only what the government decided was acceptable? Would you be proud to live in a place where people don't have the opportunity to express themselves to others freely? I wouldn't. Although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale, censorship is censorship. It is discrimination against composers of a certain genre of works. It is the removal of choice from people's lives. It is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech. Whichever way you look at it, censorship is censorship, and censorship is wrong.
1285	4262	2	3	Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music, movies, and other things for entertainment. Mainly children use the library more than any other age group. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check out things that are offensive in any type of way, not even books that will influence bad things. Therefore, certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries. Certain movies shouldn't be in the library. For example, if a child goes to the library, they might see a movie that contains sexual activity and decide to check the movie out. The kid might be underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate. The child might get in trouble by their guardian. In reality, it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out. That is why the movies should be censored. On the cover of many magazines, women's as well as men's bodies are exposed. That might cause children to be attracted to the magazine. They might even decide to check the magazine out. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example for their impressionable minds. In today's world, all children listen to music. The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life and attitudes. The music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourages you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion, only positive and influential music should be able to be rented out from such a public institution. Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you, not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should primarily have history, math, and other educational books that contribute to learning and personal growth. In conclusion, everything in the library should be censored to a degree. A lot of children use the library; therefore, it should be age-appropriate. No child needs to be put under a bad influence from materials they find in a place of learning. Certain things should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion and to maintain a wholesome environment for all patrons.
1286	4263	2	3	I think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch, content that is not suitable for their young minds. The movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids some ideas and the books should be removed because it had some words that people will be saying and the music should be removed because they have rap music. People shouldn't be listening to it. The music is sometimes not appropiate for all age and it can give people some ideas of what they say or do, influencing their behavior in negative ways. The books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say. People should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music. They are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives. Peolpe shouldn't be listening to some rap music or read the magazines or read some books that will give other people some ideas. The books sometimes talking about what happened a long time ago and stuff like that and it sometimes offense people like that, bringing up unpleasant history. The magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past and thenpeople don't want to read any magzines anymore. The people don't want to listen to any music anymore or read any books anymore. Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music are bad for the kids and for the adults. I think that it is offensive because music is not a good thing to listen to like rap or hip-hop. The people shouldn't be listening to rock music and they should just listen to some music that are appropiate, such as classical or educational songs. The books should be appropiate for all age and they should read something that they like. They should read some magazines that they like and that are good and appropiate. The music is offensive because they talk about inapproiate stuff and they shouldn't be listening to it and the magazines have some inappropiate stuff and the books have some inappropiate stuff. The people won't like it and they might not want to check it out again or they won't check nothing out. I think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like. They should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read, ensuring all materials are safe and suitable for everyone in the community.
1287	4264	2	3	i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year, which makes it hard for students to do well. so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels, focusing on the basics that everyone needs to know. however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work, showing who really learned the material. i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer, as staring at a screen can be difficult for them. this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much for considering my point of view on this important matter.
1288	4265	2	3	In libraries, there are of course books. There are mysteries, romances, comics, biographies and anything else that you @MONTH1 be able to think of. There are also magazines, movies, and even cd's that are at the libraries now. Then at libraries there are also those books and magazines. Those books being the ones I would never pick up off of the shelf myself let alone allow my future children to pick up. This is because those books contain material that is not at all conducive to the young person's brain, filled with harmful ideas and images. That is why I would like those books to be cencored so my child would never even know that the books are there, protected from such negative influences. These books have in them people having sex and smoking drugs and their language in theses books are horrifying! These seem to be the kinds of books that young children have become interested in. They read them at school and get them somehow from their friends. They also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to do because they are influenced very easily. They are influenced by books characters that dont even exist some of the time, copying their dangerous behaviors. There are many reasons of why I feel that the books should be cencored but one of the biggest reasons are that because young people read these kind of books they go out and do what they read in the books. Thinking its okay because somebody that is not even real, most of the time, is doing it. I feel that these books are the reason that babies are raising babies children that are ten are going out having sex and getting pregnant and becoming eleven year old mothers. Where is that even heard of, but it happens and by the time those same children become freshmen in high school, if they even get there, they are carrying the responsibility of the baby they had when they were eleven. Those same children go through life wondering how different their stiuations could have been! So I feel like before these books go and mess up a whole other generation of children why don't we stop it here? Why does another child have to get pregnant at the age of ten for someone else to realize it's time to change things? Ten year old children are still just babies! The human brain isnt even fully developed until you are in around the age of twenty-five. So these children dont know if what they are reading is wrong beucase they haven't been taught that it is very wrong this is because at that age no parent expects that they will have to teach their not to have sex. Why you @MONTH1 ask, because at the age of ten what child should know about sex? At that age they still like to color and play with baby dolls or they like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 they should even be thinking about sex let alone know what it is. These materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening. To stop yet another generation from messing up their lives taking the materials off is the best solution. After all shouldn't a parent get the chance to make sure their child isn't killing their chances to live a happy life in the future, ensuring their safety and well-being above all else?
1289	4266	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet, making libraries a vital resource. if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them, preventing them from completing their research or enjoying the story. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place, allowing others the freedom to choose for themselves.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter, expanding their knowledge and horizons.In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible to restore intellectual freedom and access to information for all.
1290	4267	2	3	Imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive. In this library you wouldn't find many of the great pieces of literature that have impacted and influenced society @DATE1. You probably wouldn't find too many books, magazines, or movies that everyone in the @CAPS1 feels that are appropriate. Some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people. Offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1 because something that is offensive to one person might not be to another person, who could be impacted by the piece of literature that is being banned. Music should also remain in libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to bring the listeners attention to the offensive material. Also offensive materials have made an impact in society for ages, shaping culture and thought. First, materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material. Some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people, but many others @MONTH1 enjoy the movie for its artistic value or entertainment. If a movie, book, or magazine has the topic of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, it could be considered offensive to people who were a part of it, but it could also inform the reader or the person who is watching about the events that happened. If children want to see or read this material they should get permission from their parents first, allowing for parental guidance. Next, all music should remain in libraries. The music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment. The purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners but to express creativity and emotion. The lyrics in some songs are innapropriate for children, but parents should not let their child listen to them, taking responsibility for their own family's media consumption. Lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults. Last, offensive materials have impacted society for ages. Many things the founding fathers of the @LOCATION1 did were considered offensive, but that did not make them wrong, and it made the @CAPS1 a better place @DATE1. Offensive materials impact everyday life for better and worse. If all offensive materials were banned, they wouldn't be able to have an impact on @CAPS1 for better, preventing progress and understanding. In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1. The materials @MONTH1 be controversial, but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the @CAPS1. Offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people, offering valuable lessons and perspectives. The @CAPS1 would turn into that of the @CAPS1 in @PERSON1's novel @CAPS4 @NUM1, where all books were burned and society was not intellegent at all, if offensive materials were taken out of libraries @DATE1, a fate we must strive to avoid.
1291	4268	2	3	I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, I think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter in elementeries because they wouldn't know what some things mean. If a class were to read an offensive book and someyone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get affended and it could start a fight. Some high schoolers could get affended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be aloud to be read in class or in school period. This process could involve students, parents, and teachers to decide collectively. Im pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to whats acceptable and whats not without hurting other peoples feeling and putting them down. I bet all the time in classes theres been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable, and theres always that person that always trys to make fun of something, but if I were in this situation I would try my best to not let others get to me and interfer with my grades and performance. I would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying I would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class. I'm pretty sure most schools wouldnt tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore. You should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someyone is making fun of your race or how you look. They just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of, allowing you to focus on your education and well-being.
1292	4269	2	3	Censorship in libraries differ in certain areas. I personally love reading, and like all kinds of books. And I know that there are some books that I have read that my parents would not aprove of. But has that ever stopped me? Not exactly. I think that after a certain age, people should be aloud to read whatever they want. I mean, if I ever thought I could not be mature enough to read a certain book, then I will not get or read the book, it is that simple. Personal judgment should be the primary guide for older teens and adults. As far as music, movies, and magazines go that could be a different story. Music is for the most part like a book, just using a different one of your senses. And it is listened to, not read. Movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes, because movies are like show and tell. That could easily go wrong if children, teens, etc take it more than just a movie, potentially imitating what they see. I think all things should not be judged by assumption. Everyone has different opinions and likes. So, therefore material should not be removed from shelves, if there are people that like/support what the book, movie, or music has to offer, as a diversity of content is valuable.
1293	4270	2	3	What's your first thought when you're thinking about a library? Is it quiet, peace, or calm? Many people would think that until they come opon a certain book, magazine, movie, etc. They would start reading, and soon read something that is completely offensive. Books, magazines, movies, etc. should be censored and removed from a library if found offensive. Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I believe that a library is a place of peace. Having offensive literature in a library makes it look as though it's a bit trashy. If people want to read a certain magazine or book that offends a large sum of people, then they should go somewhere besides a library to find it, like a private store. When I was younger, I participated in events at our local library; such as seeing who could read the most books over a certain amount of time, or other events like that. I liked to explore the library and find new things. I remember back then, and still today, there were always a large amount of magazines sitting on selfs, categorized into their correct sections. Many of them showing half-dressed women and men. Now, I understand that people like to know what is going on in the real world and like to be up to date, but I believe that they can go elsewhere to find such magazines. Having these offensive magazines in libraries for children to see is not good, and could easliy upset the parents of the children. Another reason why books, magazines, and others should be censored is because they might influence teens to do wrong and/or bad things. For example, many books talk about drugs and smoking. If teens read this, they might start thinking that it isn't wrong to do these things. If these type of books were to be removed from libraries, then I believe that the number of bad things that teens are influenced by would be greatly decreased because they aren't going to read them. In my personal opinion, libraries would be better if books, magazines, movies, etc. would be censored. Not only would it make people happier, it would make the world better. Besides, if you are looking to read something bad, you shouldn't be looking in a library anyway, as it should be a safe and respectful environment for all.
1294	4271	2	3	My views on censorship are strong. I think that if a book, movie, ect. is descriminating towards one or more groups of people then I think that people should have the right to atleast have a say in wether it should be on the shelves of a library or not. Although books could be descriminating too, if the book it about something that has happened in the past and is the past of our country, then I think that people should also have a say in keeping it on the shelves for educational value. If these materials are using offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against that race then they should be taken off of the shelves. If they are part of the history of the world or of our country, then I think that they should be left there for future generations to learn about it and to know that these things happened, so we do not repeat mistakes. Most materials dont try to discriminate any race, and if they did, then I don't think it would be in the library in the first place. For me, censorship could go both ways. It really just depends on the stuation and the material. Someone could have an opinion that it is offensive, but that doesnt mean that is a fact. If the book is popular in the library and a lot of people like to come in and read it, then I don't think I would remove the book. People view offensive writing and actions differently from one another. So, I think it depends on the situation and the context of the material. If I was a parent these days, I would let my child read one of these so called offensive books if it was part of the past for our country. My attentions for letting him read it are for all the right reasons. I dont attend to let him read it so that he can act upon the things told about in the book. I would let him read it to learn about the past. I think it is a positive thing for children to know about the past and understand historical context. So, in my perspective, censorship depends on the situation and the material. These are only my views on the topic, and also these statements are my opinion. So I can't really say if I am for censorship or not, as it is a complex issue with many sides.
1295	4272	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, suck as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No I do not believe this statement for many reasons. If anybody cold take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certian topics in the world, it would defeat the purpus of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed. One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive there would no longer be any books no the shelves. This would limit us the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world. Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk', (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education. Yes, that might be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unpretected sex. This might lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnate, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school. Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someones very hard work and just throwing it into the trash. In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books. Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away. This would being defeating the purpose of haveing freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allow to state thier oppinion, which is a fundamental right. This problem could easily be avoided if needed. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magizines, etc., could be put in a seprate section of the library, and only make it availble to adults of a certain age. Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are. This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem without resorting to removal. Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, suck as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive. It could effect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the autor of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem that preserve both access and respect.
1296	4273	2	3	Yes, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate. People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner. If people want to have their things shown, such as movies, or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate for the general public. Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right. Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do. Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things; they just want to be heard, or want attention from others. When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger. I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right and acceptable. People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard by a wider audience. I learned that to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate and respectful manner. Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of negative things to kids, but they feel the only way to get their stuff out to the public is to make it offensive and shocking. I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff that contributes positively. The way I look at things is @CAPS1 ( @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Do), and that guides my actions.
1297	4274	2	3	Censorship has been around for awhile and a lot of people agree that there should be censorship on a lot of things like television, books, magazines, almost about everything. Some people are going a little bit too far when it comes to older teens. They are not little kids and they shouldn't have things censored for them. Like when you go to see a rated @CAPS1 movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie, it seems unnecessary for someone who is almost an adult. For little kids I think that they should have things censored because they are young and impressionable. They just don't need to be hearing bad language and anything inappropriate for their age. Parents should also care about what their child hears or reads if they are young. Some parents don't even care what they see or hear and they end up getting in trouble with their teachers if they say it at school. It seems like the younger kids are always learning bad language or bad habits and I think its sad because they shouldn't be around that kind of influence. They pick up a lot of stuff when they are young so you are like a role model for them. I believe that older teens like @NUM1 and @NUM2 are more mature about this; if they read a book in the library that might have a bad word, it is not a big deal. I'm sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when you are in town. They are going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when they are going to end up hearing it eventually. Books are supposed to help you and give you the real thing about life. You can't just throw out books or censor them for everyone. Everybody has their different opinion and this is my opinion on the matter. When you get to a certain age you start to mature and realize those are bad things to say or do, so I believe high school books or magazines or anything else shouldn't be censored for older students.
1298	4275	2	3	Imagine, you go into your favorite library and you go to grab your favorite book or movie and its not there. The librarian says the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive by a small group of people. Would this not get on your nerves? Especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it? Sure, there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material; but why remove them completely from everyone? There are plenty of alternate solutions that could please everyone. Such as having a section only adults are allowed into, having a separate public place for adults to get the books, movies, etc; and having signed permission from a parent or guardian saying their child could check out certain items. The first solution is to have certain offensive material under lock and key from the general public. If only the librarian had access to this material, a child could not simply walk in and borrow what he, or she deems fit. The librarian would be the only one allowed to judge if the person, child or adult, was mature enough to see this section of the library. Next, there could be a totally separate building for the offensive material. Only people over @NUM1 would be let in and you would have to show an i.d. and a library card to get in. This would assure that no one underage could receive or take anything that was deemed unfit for them. My last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage. When the child comes to get a library card the parent must be present and fill out an application saying what the child can and cannot check out based on their own family values. I do not believe that books, movies, music, etc; should be removed from shelves entirely. This directly goes against the first amendment, free speech. If a person can say what someone else can or cannot read, see, or listen to, what's to stop them from taking every @CAPS1 given right we have? What's to stop them from censoring everything we write and say? Would you want to live in a world like that? I would most certainly not! However, I also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material. I believe these are good alterations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them effectively.
1299	4276	2	3	What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value deeply. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is in the world. Different types of books explain different types of things and perspectives. Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand, finding comfort or inspiration within the pages. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings and limit their understanding. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music that speak to them. They use music to escape their problems and taking that away can leave them feeling helpless and alone. People love movies for the stories they tell. It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views and experiences. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment that they enjoy and learn from. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive to some, but it's not up to anybody else to decide for everyone. Magazines help people keep up with current news and events. Most of the news can be very offensive as it reports on difficult topics. It is the people around you causing the offensive news, not the magazine itself. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news that they rely on. Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause people to act out in a bad way out of frustration. Everybody is different and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel if your favorite book was banned?
1300	4277	2	3	'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2'. Do these titles sound familiar? They should, because these are only a tiny fraction of the @CAPS3 literary masterpieces that people have enjoyed since their publications. These wonderful books also share another characteristic; they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world for various reasons. When a child goes off to school each day, his or her parents are left to think that he or she will be getting a quality education that meets the standards of their own core values and morals. But certain parents @MONTH1 become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right. In all reality though, how is this helping anyone in the long run? By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn about the world. By censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think critically. If a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on important things. When one cannot think for oneself or make decisions for oneself, how can this person be considered a truly free individual? Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think. By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think. And when you want a book out of a school library you are not only keeping your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book and forming their own opinion. How is that fair to the other students? So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, I say this. Teach your children to be careful and discerning in what they read. If you don't want them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2' tell them not to read that specific book. Tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughts instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyone else about it.
1301	4278	2	3	Certain books should be removed from the library because of the materials and the stuff they show to younger children. One reason they should take those books off is because some of them are racist against some cultures, promoting harmful stereotypes and ideas. Another reason is that some of the books or movies would have things in them that young children should not be looking at or reading, such as inappropriate images or themes. A final reason is that some books just should not be in the libraries at all, as they are not suitable for a public, educational environment. The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because they are racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things about history and people. Also they can teach the children how to treat people differently because they are reading those books from the library. They would also get the wrong idea about people and different cultures, which could lead to prejudice. Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in them that young children should not be watching or reading. Like they should not have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child should not be looking at. It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think it is okay because they seen it in the movies or read it in a book, and they might try to imitate those actions. Final reason is that they should not just have those things in a library at all or should just have a place for where the young kids cannot use them, like a restricted section. Or they would need a parent or somebody that is eighteen so they would not be able to just get these bad books or movies without supervision. In conclusion libraries should not have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all if they contain harmful content. They give kids wrong ideas and make them think that it is cool or the right thing to do because they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That does not make it the right thing to do, which is why they should get rid of that stuff to protect young minds.
1302	4279	2	3	Keep it on the shelves. The reason for libraries is so that people can read what they want to read. If I owned a library I would have everything on the shelves because there are a lot of people and not everyone likes the same thing; everyone has different tastes and interests. Truthfully I would not care because it is not just about a handful of people it is about everyone's feelings and their right to access information. If people started taking certain things out of their book stores and libraries it would eventually get out of hand. The reason it would get out of hand is because a certain topic like slavery; if someone wanted to learn about it or enjoyed reading topics like that it would not be fair because other people might find it offensive to put stuff out there for the public like that, but that should not limit access for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion but why express your own opinion if the subject you want to express it under is not harming anyone physically or emotionally? If everyone's opinion was heard and taken into consideration the world as we know it would be boring and outrageous. People like action and adventures, others like laid back kind of stuff. Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if it is just going to start a conflict and change the way people live everyday life? Maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that, a billion to a thousand. Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others so keep everything on the shelves. If only certain people are going to complain about it, it is not really a big deal. Maybe someday when everyone in the world agrees on one reasoning then we could change it but I really do not see that happening anytime soon. The main reason is there is always going to be conflict between two or more groups of people. Everyone cannot be happy at the same time; I say who cares whether something offends someone or not, that is their opinion, and until a lot more people are seeing it that way, the material can stay on the shelf for the people that actually enjoy that kind of stuff.
1303	4280	2	3	Books? Movies? Music? Magazines? We all like to read them, watch them, and listen to them. It is hard to stop all that. Plus, it is impossible to stop. Everywhere you go you can find these items. Such as the movie store, the mall, a gas station, a yard sale, and even your public library. People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book, movie, a magazine, or a CD and it is perfectly fine. But, there is one problem. Censorship. Yes that is what I said, 'censorship.' It means a lot to some parents when it comes to their children. Especially when it comes to the public library where they live. If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books or movies that is okay, but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine having 'bad things' in it that children should not see, that is a problem. They want to be able to enjoy the movie or magazine with their children but bad things like nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND people alone, not just parents. A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea. There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at or watch or read any 'bad things' because we all know that is not right. Kids are young and do not need to be learning about that stuff at a young age; they should be protected from such content. I think censoring is a really great idea and I think libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, should censor their things. But if they will not censor anything they should at least put them in categories such as 'adults' or 'young adults' or 'kids'. If they categorize the ratings then the parents and you know where to look for and do not have to worry about censorship. Censorship should be practiced everywhere to ensure a safe environment for children.
1304	4281	2	3	Corrupt Censorship. Problems occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor, and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the educational rules the library is equipped with. Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not allowed to, unless given permission from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice. Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criteria. In some instances, a partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexplicable persuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creator's fault to ensure where their content is displayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is a choice to read or see whatever you would like; you are not forced upon to follow through to what the distributor, let alone the creator, is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional. When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it is your will to choose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship is not up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it is not your obligation to view it. When you take down materials that were intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not only the art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewer's taste. Libraries should not exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
1305	4282	2	3	Nowadays people can get offended over anything. In today's trying time readers, listeners, even writers, are trying to get what they want, not what the consumer wants. Even though some stories, books, or articles are completely bogus, it should not matter. Do not let others opinions ruin it for everyone else. Many people get offended nowadays over absolutely nothing; and they feel the need to do something about it, which necessarily is not a bad thing but is not a good thing either. It is freedom of speech, or so that is what the constitution says, meaning folks have the right to read, write, or say, anything they please without undue restriction. Fake and bogus writings are a small problem to readers and writers. People are reading articles and books and believing every bit of what they read or write or even hear on their radio in recent times. It is hard to believe anything nowadays because you never really know the facts unless you experience them yourself; misinformation is a real issue. Opinions are the big thing folks have to look out for, but still that goes back to the freedom of speech. Reading and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human will ever know; it is a fundamental part of our culture. Just do not let other readers opinions get in the way of a great thing and the free exchange of ideas.
1306	4283	2	3	Controversy and Censorship 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controversial and deeply personal. The creator of each song, movie, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desperate sex-crazed men, and a children's cartoon or a simple picture book wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative or harmful. It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and utterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree and see it as a form of expression. Some religions think the Harry Potter series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversy fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices. Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the Harry Potter books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That made me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as God vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's. If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own. All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts.
1307	4284	2	3	No I do not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason, and that principle should extend to the materials available in our public libraries. Sure some things might not be appropriate for certain people or age groups, but everyone is gonna eventually hear, see, or be involved in something they are not supposed to like, enjoy, or agree with. That is simply a part of life and navigating the world. The role of a library is to provide access to a wide range of ideas and information, not to curate a collection based on what might offend a particular individual or group. If we start removing one thing, it sets a dangerous precedent where anyone can demand the removal of anything they find objectionable. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the individual, or with parents in the case of children, to choose what to engage with, rather than with the library to limit those choices for everyone.
1308	4285	2	3	Do people take offensive books seriously? There are lots of stuff in books that people often think is offensive. Some other people sometimes think differently. I am pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways to handle it. I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are available at the library. They see stuff that's around them in the wider world. They also see what their mentor and parents are doing and watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library, as it reflects the broader society. In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that their mentor and parents are doing. Now today in the 21st century parents really don't keep a good eye on things and what they leave out for what their child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want their child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what their kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs, rather than demanding the library remove items. I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they couldn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library. We shouldn't take books as offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of the library. Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly and form their own educated opinions.
1309	4286	2	3	"I think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves. If a book, magazine, movie, etc, is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it. Don't go back and keep looking at it because what you find offensive someone else might like and find value in. The world won't change around you so you should do the smart thing and ignore it. If something is found offensive on censorship in libraries then maybe its not a good idea for you to be where you are in that library. And if something does offend you, you should still act appropriately and deal with the situation the right way by simply moving on. When I was younger I used to see books with a cover titled ""Captain Underpants"" or other silly subjects, and would think it was funny, but the adults didn't think so. The books are put there for people to read not just to look at. The books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way. If you find something offensive then you should just move away from that area, so that you won't worry about having to be offended. Different people like different things, so they will have many different varieties to choose from in a library. They might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like. You have to make a wise choice and know that if something is going to offend you stay away from it. Censorship in libraries have every right to put up any and every piece of book, music, movie, magazine, etc., because it is in their facility. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended by anything they put up. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended because ninety-nine percent of the time the things they put up are not bad at all, 'it might even be helpful,' but to one person it might be harmful or offend them. In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want. If you're offended or not offended they have every right to shelve whatever it is, because in the real world you don't always get what you want, and you won't always like what you see."
1310	4287	2	3	A library is a safe haven. A place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book. It is a place filled with knowledge and information from countless sources and perspectives. You can find information on anything in a library, from any point of view. Information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive by some. A library should not be biased. Removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge. Whether or not something is offensive, the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses. Having information in a library that might be offensive does not mean a person is obliged to read it. Katherine Paterson brings up a good point when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...and you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. If everyone could remove a book that offended them, there would be no books left, defeating the very purpose of a library. There are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others' points of views. For example, there are many different religions in the world. Many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points might offend each other. That does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion might be offended. Every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others' religions. If we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated and closed-off world. A library is a place of education and learning. It is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses. If libraries censored information, then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased. It would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore, no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world. One could not go to a library and get different points of views on every subject. Censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing for a free and open society.
1311	4288	2	3	Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are many, many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as, sexcism, racism, rarted @CAPS3, and pornography. So I am here today to tell you all about them things. First off, books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children. Why? Because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things that the book does, which could lead to them hurting others. Another thing is sex in books. I know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things, and such content is simply not suitable for a young audience. So to sum this up, they shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @CAPS2-@CAPS3 movies. Things such as horror movies, porn, and many more. So young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age. It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older, filling their heads with ideas and images that are not meant for them. The last reason why I feel that many things shouldn't be in the libraries are for the @CAPS4 magazines. Those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them. These really do not need to be exposed to our young children because our little girls will think it is ok for them to take naked photos of themselves and post it in books and on the internet, which is a very dangerous path. So all in all, all of these things should be banded from the libraries for many different reasons. So the @LOCATION1 should think about what I am saying. Just think if it were your children being exposed to innappropiate things.
1312	4289	2	3	As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1. As I was walking into my public library the other day I was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details? I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but I feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, I do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when I read that book today I do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it, which is a true shame. Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. The point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. When you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship.
1313	4290	2	3	Almost every city in the @LOCATION1 has a public library. A place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines and more. Inside a library, there are different sections. There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children. A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?' Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. As a child, you want to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice. Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike. Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief. Almost every library is very organized into categories. If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children. Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed. However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did. There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life. I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of. However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries.
1314	4291	2	3	Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2? I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward, and it could disrupt the quiet atmosphere that people need. Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously and should maintain a certain standard. If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle, often with just a few clicks online. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries. How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such, which includes making careful choices about the materials available to the public.
1315	4292	2	3	There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at. It's like the adult section at the library. Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people, so that everyone can find what they need without issue. It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended. Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people. The only way I would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that, which promote genuine harm. Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing. Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library, it helps maintain a comfortable environment for all visitors. So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library.
1316	4293	2	3	There are many books, movies, and magazines on shelves that can offend people in many ways. These can be books depicting the harsh realities of war, the brutal history of slavery, and even religious texts interpreted in ways that could aggravate people and make them feel the need to remove those materials from the libraries without hesitation. There are indeed many books out there that could offend people and could be perceived as discriminating, but should those books really be taken out? I believe that books were made for a purpose. Each book and even magazine contains a fact of information regarding what is either happening in the world or what could happen. Even for the books that are unrealistic, they are also made for a reason, such as to spark imagination, and should be allowed to have their place in the library. The library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from. If there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive, they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want. I feel that it is the person's choice of what they want to read or watch, not the books' or movies' fault. The books and movies are also helpfully split into genres into which each movie and book belongs. So if you don't specifically want to see something, then you can just skip the section the movies or books are in that you find discriminating and go to the ones that you feel okay with. There are also many books and movies out there that might seem discriminating but they could actually teach you about life and what could happen and how to solve these problems. One example is when I was a child growing up I was reading about this girl getting into a car accident and losing everything just because she was drunk while she was driving. My mother didn't want me reading the book, but it actually helped me a lot because it taught me the valuable lesson of never drinking and driving; because of reading that book at such a young age and implanting the story in my head I know that I will never in my life do what that girl did to herself. This shows that even if a book might seem discriminating and wrong, it can still teach people life lessons and dangers that they probably wouldn't know about unless they read that book or watched that movie. I feel that even if we removed the offensive magazines, books, and movies that don't have any potential what so ever, people would still find a way to get what they were looking for, even if it is from the library or not. There are many people that are wrong in this world and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn't stop them from doing what they want to do. Music is another thing that shouldn't be that troubled about. Some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down. One example is the rapper @ORGANIZATION1. His songs consist of severe sadness and frequent cussing, but in his songs are messages that can relate to other people and listening to that certain song might stop them from doing illegal things or even committing suicide. The songs can symbolize their lives and make them know that they are not the only ones living that way and that they aren't always alone in what they do. I feel that each book, movie, and magazine has at least one thing that a person can find offensive. If we start removing each one that someone finds offensive, then there probably wouldn't be a single book left on the library shelves. The books we read, the magazines we glance at, and the movies we watch will probably have something offensive in them but I do not think that they should be censored or removed because there is always a chance that those books, movies, or magazines could help you out later in life.
1317	4294	2	3	Freedom of speech and the freedom of press is a privilege we as @CAPS1 are lucky to have. I don't believe in censorship in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have a fundamental right to express their opinions in their work. If they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice. They have a right as people to portray their books, magazines, and movies anyway they want. We all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries. Movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film. For example if you are a @NUM1 year old who wants to checkout a movie but, it's rated @CAPS2 that is not the best choice of movie. It may not be the best choice because movies rated @CAPS2 let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of @NUM2. As for books, I often use a book review website that allows me to see the content the book has. If I see that the book contains material I don't wish to read about or think the material is too mature, I simply don't read it. I hold the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level. There are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout. Just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. We all make choices in our everyday lives. Some are big and some are small. Picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle. Author's, directors, and editors should not have their work punished if some people don't agree with the content they are putting in their material. Everyone's opinion varies on what's right and wrong. Therefore if you believe something is inappropriate you have the choice of not reading or watching it. I do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. Although we shouldn't abuse it we must not forget we have no right to tell others how to use this freedom. As we have the choice to read what we want to, authors have a choice on what they want to write about. Libraries shouldn't take away this freedom that allows us to make our own informed decisions on what we view or read.
1318	4295	2	3	Do you ever feel like books, music, movies, magazines and etc., are offensive sometimes? To my experience of listening to music and watching movies it can be offensive sometimes without even knowing it. I have listened to rap before and all the cuss words they use, and watching movies with only white people or black people. So I think some music, movies and etc., could be considered for being taken off. If I think something is offensive I pretty much blow it off like its nothing. I do that because I have watched @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 where the white and black people didn't get along, and they had to play football together. Then they finally got along and won the championship game. To me I think that's awesome because people were offensive, and got over it and now they're friends. So I don't take @CAPS3 as offensive. I say that because how do you know that the actor or the writer was or is talking about you. I look at this like it's a little deal. I like @CAPS3 like that I find it entertaining. It can also help you learn, about what's happening in our world, and what we have accomplished. So I really don't take this @CAPS3 as offensive. But, other people can take it as offensive and that's their problem. There is nothing that can be done, it's over with. If something is offensive then don't listen to it or don't watch or read it. So I don't think it's right to pull it off the shelf and abhor it. They can have a really good meaning behind it. There are many movies, songs and books in the world that are good. So don't abominate it and go on in life, don't let @CAPS3 get to you. That's why I don't think it's right to pull it off the shelf and take it as offensive, and that is why I think it is not inherently bad to encounter @CAPS3.
1319	4296	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library. I think that's the best thing for them to do when they don't have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate. In high school just walking down the hall ways you're going to learn a lot of things you probably don't need to know yet but when you walk into a library they don't need to encourage it by putting books about drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves. Books about drugs are alright to an extent. If you're reading about medicines you can take and being in the doctor's office and getting prescriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth that's a little much. We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we don't need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth. Books about alcohol are the same way. We need to know the dangers of drinking but we don't need to know about teen parties and things to do when you're drunk. Advertisements, magazines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those things in high school. The front cover of magazines always have people who have got caught with drugs, who is dating or sleeping around with who and I know that we will and need to know these things but I don't think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it. I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taken out of the libraries so that the kids have something to learn about and ask their parents about. I have been in the libraries and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three involved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun. This is what I think about some of those books on the shelves and what I believe should happen to maintain a more appropriate learning environment. Sincerely, @LOCATION1.
1320	4297	2	3	Libraries. Do you go to libraries? Many people all over go to libraries for many different reasons. Sometimes when you go there, you have to have a reason to be there. You also have to be very quiet. Libraries are very interesting in many ways. Some people ask what a library is, well they are good places to go. People can go there for many different things. Most of the time, when people go to a library, they go to get books. Not only can you get books from there, but also go there for school tutoring, for a place to read, and just to go somewhere quiet. See libraries have many things to do. Why do people go to libraries? Well I personally do not go to a library but many others do. People that like to read go there to get a kind of book they want. I would go there for tutoring for school, I honestly need it. It helps you a lot and gets your homework done. My mother goes there on some occasions, like, to get information from a book or a computer. They have a lot of information that you can look for. Then there are online geeks, who like to get online for video games. I get on the internet but not for video games. There is another reason why people go to the library. My little sister loves going to the library. She is only eight years old. Why am I telling you this? Well when you go into a library, you cannot check out a book if you are under age without permission. In that case, you have to have parents permission to be able to get one, but not only that, you have to have a library card in order to get a book. I know, stupid rules right? So then again you have to have parents permission for that too! Well after the permission is all said and done, when you go to get a book, you have to make sure it's your own grade level. I have to watch that with my sister all the time because if not, then they will yell at you. I personally think that is good for most kids. So now you know that libraries are very strict. Now that I told you all about libraries, I hope you learned something from it. Remember that they are very good places to go to for information, to get books, or just to go somewhere quiet. You can always find a library around, there are many of them! Well if you don't like to read or be quiet, then you shouldn't go. I'm going to leave that decision to yourself.
1321	4298	2	3	In @LOCATION1, people like to do many different things for fun. Some like to go to movies, enjoying the latest blockbusters or independent films. Others prefer a nice walk through the park, appreciating the natural scenery and fresh air. Nowadays everyone seems to be stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad, nasty, offensive things. I believe that we should be able to see whatever we want. The first reason we should be able to read whatever we want is because we have the right to. There are lots of things that we can't do but reading should not be one of those things. We shouldn't have to ask someone if a book is ok to read or not. It's not fair to those who want to read it. I find it very dumb and restrictive. The second reason we should be able to read whatever we want is because if you don't like it, don't read it. This is a very simple and straight forward concept. Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing. If you don't like something then don't pick it up and read it. If I knew there was a book that I didn't like because it was offensive to me, I wouldn't read it. It's just that easy and personal. The third and final reason why we should be able to read whatever we want is because it's none of your business what other people do or read. Everybody today is so worried about the next guy that it's not even funny. If we all just worried about ourselves, then we would be better off as a society. If I read a book that I found offensive or bad, I wouldn't go around telling others it's a bad book and that it should be pulled off the shelves. It's not right and it's not fair to impose my views on others. We should be able to read whatever we want. It's our right to read it. Also, if you don't like it, then don't read it. People today are too worried about other people and their choices. If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing that you can do about it, and that is the way life works.
1322	4299	2	3	If you take offense to certain things, you shouldn't read the pieces of literature that make you feel like that. Ask some of your friends or research the book or magazine before you read it to get a better idea of its content. Sometimes the front cover can be deceiving so make sure you read the description first to avoid any unpleasant surprises. Many people that read certain things @MONTH1 take them the wrong way and think they say something they don't really mean. Which is why they take offense to it, but the more you understand a piece of literature the less you are offended by its content. You should try to at least accept some of what the book or magazine says just in case you need it in the future for reference or understanding. You @MONTH1 get upset when you read something for the first time, and @MONTH1 not notice that it could help you when you think about it more deeply. Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, just look from both points of view presented. They both could have good ideas and functions to them that are worth considering. Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them; don't read a lot of books or magazines that have offensive things in them if they bother you. Ignore the ads on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them. If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad and frustrated. Sometimes they can even make you stress a little about the content. If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it completely. Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them, providing peace of mind. This works for a lot of situations not just this one, so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them and move on.
1323	4300	2	3	Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before. However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read? Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts. Different assortments of media should definitely not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be. Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right for society. Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people? If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library? Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning and intellectual growth. These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyone's benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education and access. Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them. With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better. Although this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for. The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics and the counterarguments. Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well with incomplete arguments. Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1, and hopefully globally someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit. People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance or innovate. Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1. Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them effectively. Would he have become such a hit if others did not believe this as well? To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed intellectually. People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in libraries. These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives. Though there will always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it with knowledge. We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only debilitating ourselves and our potential. These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever and benefit future generations.
1324	4301	2	3	I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that item and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers and their values. Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @CAPS1 used to let me do when I was a kid. If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad or inappropriate. They could also pick up a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images or content on the inside that is not suitable. When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. We were flipping through the channels waiting for the game to come back on. We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the television that children's eyes shouldn't see. That occurrence happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it. That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but children's eyes can see it as well, which is a problem. Libraries should think of this when they are putting books and magazines on their shelves for public access. They might be making a little bit of money from rentals but they are affecting a child's life in a negative way with inappropriate materials. Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a child's book and what is an adult magazine just by looking at it. Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside when played. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries to protect the young. If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelf. The library might not do it every time, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children and families. If the library doesn't take the items off the shelf it could affect their business in a negative way by driving away customers. The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for, as they are the primary users. The library shouldn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times and does not understand the community. The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often and support it. I think that all offensive images and materials to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library entirely. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could affect their business, but because it could affect the lives of children in a positive or negative way, and their well-being should be the priority.
1325	4302	2	3	The offensive things found in a library are a topic of discussion. In many libraries now a days there are all kinds of violent and bad books talking about violence and other mature themes. Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelves? We should find out a reasonable solution. The library should not have to take these types of things out of the library entirely. If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them, like an adult or restricted section. For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library as well. You have to be over @NUM1 years of age to access them, which is a common rule. For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it, following standard guidelines. If the parents don't like the content then they shouldn't get it for their children, it's their responsibility. They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have to keep them separate. Kids under a certain age should not be allowed to read the books in that section without permission. If they still want the book they have to get parent's permission to rent it, ensuring oversight. Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library for those who are permitted. You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and preferably with an adult for guidance. If you want to rent a movie you need to have parent's permission if you are underage. You also have to watch this movie with an adult present to provide context. Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it on your own. You can still rent it if your parents say it's ok and they approve. They should make the @CAPS5 albums kept behind the counter for controlled access. So that little kids can not see the front of the cases with potentially offensive art. If the parents don't like the libraries rules then they shouldn't rent anything from the library that they find objectionable. So don't take off the offensive books, movies, or @CAPS5 music entirely from the library. If you were head of the library what would you do in this situation? Would you take out the offensive things completely, or just put them in different sections with proper restrictions? The latter seems more reasonable for access and choice.
1326	4303	2	3	Reading is a very popular and fundamental activity. It is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in the classroom. School libraries are filled with different varieties of books and magazines and such, catering to a wide array of interests. Some of these books could be arguably offensive to some people. These books, however, should not be taken away from the library shelves. There are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book. Whether it be sexual or even political, if the reader finds it offensive they will not read the rest of the book. There are books out there that describe in detail sexual scenes and many parents do not want their kids to read these kinds of books. This is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves. It may be offensive to certain people but if you took it off of the shelves it would not be available for others to read who can handle that kind of story. Parents' kids should simply not read these books, or they can be guided toward more suitable selections. Libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books and find value in them.  There are also books about politics, which can be particularly contentious. Majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true. When a reader comes across a book that is against the way they see politics, there can be a real problem. With politics being a serious matter, many people can overreact when someone tells them what they believe and think is true is really not. Politicians themselves especially can be sensitive. Still, many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before, offering new perspectives. If a reader does not agree with what the author is writing or they find it offensive, they should not read the book. There are plenty of other readers out there that would like to read that book and to learn more about politics. If a reader knows that this kind of reading offends them, then they should know better than to pick up the book in the first place and seek out other materials.  Many libraries offer music, movies and magazines to check out and to take home, expanding their services beyond books. It is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive. For this reason, they should not check them out if they are concerned. Many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language, as it is something that adds to the song or movie's character. People know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away from what bothers them. As long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf. Taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library, reducing its appeal. You could go to your local library and find people looking through the music section, and the music section is the only reason they come to the library in the first place. The music and movie section should stay in libraries. The people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive and make their choices accordingly.  Libraries should not take certain books, movies, and magazines away that some people find offensive. Some books and music do have contents that are offensive to some readers and viewers, which is an undeniable fact. However, if it is offensive to the first person, it does not mean it will be offensive to the next, as tastes and tolerances vary greatly. The libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers who rely on them for information and entertainment. Reading is an extremely popular activity, and its value is immense. Readers want a variety of books, music and movies to choose from, and a library that provides this variety serves its community best by respecting diverse tastes and intellectual freedoms.
1327	4304	2	3	In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, may be something that someone might want to know about or even find enlightening. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do. Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written, often to convey a specific message or story. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't appreciate them. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because it may be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible to them?  One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for and can avoid what they don't. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly while browsing. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen as frequently. It also helps keep everything organized that way, making the library more efficient. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that may be offensive to you, thus solving the problem without removal.  Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do; it is their core function. That is the main reason for libraries existing in the first place. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else, providing a unique resource. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left on the shelves, defeating the library's purpose entirely. A library must offer a broad collection to be effective.  In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason, whether educational, artistic, or personal. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see in the first place. So keeep the books on the shelves and trust individuals to make their own reading choices, as this is the foundation of a free and educated society.
1328	4305	2	3	Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books, which can be overwhelming. That isnt the only choice they are faced with either, adding to the complexity. There is music and magazines too, offering even more variety. Just within the books, there are so many different subjects and catagories between kids books, biographies, autobiographies, etc., each with its own audience. On top of that there are alot of different types of music to fit everyones different styles and preferences. Some people might say that some of the books and/or music could be found offensive or not appropriate for all ages. But out of all the meterial in the library, I don't think there should be a problem with staying away from a the things that you might find offensive, as personal responsibility is key. Therefore I do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions that are not universal.  There are multiple different books in a library and just because one might find one book offensive doesnt mean that the book should be pulled off the shelves permanently. The reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and may need it for something they are doing, such as research or personal interest. People should know what they are looking for at the library and if they think that a book may be offensive then they could keep their self from checking out that book, exercising simple discretion.  This problem is similar to others around the world, illustrating a common principle. For example, when you go to the mall there are shops that you know you like and go to, and you stay away from the ones that you dont like or might find offensive due to the items they sell. That doesnt mean that store should be banned from the mall, as that would be unfair. Thats because some people might find that store interesting and want to purchase some of thier items, valuing what it offers. I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library; diversity of choice benefits everyone.  A way that a library could adress this problem with out pulling theses books from the shelves is maybe taking a survey from thier local visitors in thier town by asking them what they think on some of the different genres of books and different styles of music. After taking this survey the library then could seperate these items into different catagories or sections within the library, making organization clearer. This could help this problem tremendously due to the fact people could stay away from those sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for alot easier and without confrontation.  I know when I sit down and read im not always caught reading the most popular subjects; my tastes are my own. I like to read subjects such as murder files, drug bust, biographies, and autobiographies, which some may find intense. And then when it comes to music I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc., enjoying the diversity. Some people may find that wierd and unusual but it just goes to show that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing, and that is perfectly fine. Therefore the library should keep the wide selection of different meterial and keep everyone happy by catering to a broad spectrum of interests and tolerances.
1329	4306	2	3	I think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now from their collections. If parents or people dont want to read those type of books they dont have to; it is a matter of personal choice. But they should'nt be removed for everyone else. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made, contributing to its narrative or message. When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should'nt be any changes made to it or its availability, as that would compromise the author's work.  If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate for their sensibilities. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind, which requires descriptive language. I know I do, as it enhances the experience. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age, which is a common practice. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should'nt be too worried about exposure. So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries, as age restrictions help manage access. On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed, in my view.  Movies are a whole different thing then books, as they are a visual medium. They show the material that is being described in explicit detail and I dont think teens should be watching that kind of content freely. They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me, causing discomfort. I would'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling, as it feels awkward. Then again its just my opinion, and others may disagree. If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should'nt be a problem for their family, but library policies might still need consideration.  Music is'nt that bad compared to visual media, but it can still be contentious. There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in, which is understandable. I totally agree with their concern. My parents at the beggining would'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over, wanting to protect me. As I got older they did'nt care much because I would'nt listen to it as much, showing how maturity changes things. Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age, with its messages. Some of what they sing does'nt even make much sense, lacking substance. In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books or educational content, to maintain a certain standard.  Magazines are not really a problem in most cases, as they are generally mild. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips, which are harmless. They have horoscopes and give advise on various life topics. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style, providing entertainment. It has some what gossip, but usually not offensive. There mostly for older teens and grown ups, who can process the content. For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties and interests suitable for their age. This is my point of view on things, and I stand by it. I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think based on my experiences. I also know that there may be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice, showing that these concerns are shared by others.
1330	4307	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials; books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from the shelf if it is offensive to some people? Accordingly, I do not believe this way, as it sets a problematic precedent. If we were to take books off a shelf for everyone who thought it was offensive, we wouldn't have any books left on the shelf, leaving the library barren. According to my prior knowledge, I know certain materials will affect different people in different ways, which is a fundamental aspect of human diversity. I have had my own experience when in svhool that highlights this. Some people do not want to
1331	4308	2	3	Have you ever wandered through the library just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even CD that didn't involve inappropriate material for once? You feel like a little kid in the shopping mall just impatiently waiting to find that one toy, but it never shows up. You spend seconds, minutes, even hours still slowly pacing back and forth shelf to shelf, scanning titles and hoping for a pleasant discovery, and finally you find it and you open it and see the most inappropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgar language, or even take a skim through the most offensive reading yet. Do you wish it'd change? I visit the library every time after I finish my book, I have loved reading from the time I was little. Lately I feel like my reading interest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately I feel like every book I pick up comes off offensive. For example I went to the check out a new book, I was mind boggled at this time because unlike usual I had no clue on which book I was even interested on to read next. The librarian directed me to their new best seller and said addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it out and after the first paragraph I wanted to throw up. This book was too gory and I felt like it downgraded women, I was anything but satisfied. This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope I could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me. Our library seems to be over packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. Lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to alter and I don't like it. It seems as if I can't open my page without seeing a half dressed girl, some inappropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection. Seeing these vulgar images are enough to make me not only flip the page, but also never second guess about opening a magazine again. Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted. There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same. I go to the library to check out some new CD's and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actually sell this garbage. I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new inappropriate vocabulary. I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. We just need to find it again. I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnecessary items at the library. I know I'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard many others would too. We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we want music that won't pollute our brains.
1332	4309	2	3	I don't think certain materials should be removed from library shelves. People have the option to get what they choose from the shelves; the librarians don't force them to choose the item. It is a free country and I think people should choose what they want. If the people don't like it then read the back of the movie or book before you choose it, or simply select a different item that better suits your personal tastes and standards. The responsibility lies with the individual to make their own informed choices, not with the institution to limit the choices available to everyone else. This principle of personal selection is fundamental to a free and open society where diverse materials can coexist for different audiences.
1333	4310	2	3	I believe that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the country of the United States there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the United States of America for their music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free? I think that there should be no way that anything can be banned in a library; there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad? I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents don't want their children seeing. So don't censor it; still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a library. There should be no censorship in the land of free speech. How would we be called the land of the free if we are censoring everything? That is why I don't think we should censor anything in America, as it contradicts the very freedoms we claim to uphold.
1334	4311	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves if someone thinks they are offensive. Just because one person finds them offensive doesn't mean that they should be taken away from others who may like them. People are different, therefore we like different types of things: different music, books, movies, and magazines. If you find it offensive, don't listen, look, or read it. Listen to the music you like, watch the movies you like, and read the books and magazines you enjoy. But just because you don't like something don't try and take it away from those that do. People are very different in many ways, so let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes. Censorship has always been an issue but I believe that if people would just stick to what they know and like and leave everything and everyone else alone all would be ok. I understand that some people might find some things that are on the shelves today offensive, but if you don't like it don't look at it or listen to it. Let it go and stick to what you know and like. After all, the world is a very diverse place and we were not all made the same, so a library's collection should reflect that diversity for the benefit of all its patrons.
1335	4312	2	3	Do you believe that if you just take a book off a shelf you or your kids won't be exposed to offensive material? If you do, then you are wrong. You can't isolate your family or other families from the world because you are scared that they might pick up something bad. Everyday, whether they read a book or not they are still exposed to vulgar behavior. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote by Katherine Paterson also helps understand the concept. If someone were to take a book off of a shelf at their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no books left for children and even adults to read. In every book there is some form of material that people may not be a fan of. There would soon be nothing left. There isn't a day that goes by that a kid doesn't hear something offensive. Even at school, where it's supervised, children bring words that they have heard their parents say or things that they have seen their parents do, and they share them with other kids. You can't protect them from every small encounter they are faced with. Some books are by far more offensive than others, but are you going to give a kid a book that has vulgar language or, will you give a child a book that's about a bear running out of honey in his jar? Most children don't go to a library or a store without supervision if their parent is being careful about just books. Therefore, their parents probably aren't going to allow them to pick up an obscene book or magazine, and in fact they would probably try to hide it from them. If a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material. If you can't make the world kid safe, then why would you try to make a library the same exact way? There are other people out there that might find the very material that you think is offensive fascinating, and a library is there to suit everyone's needs; it isn't there for just children, but for the entire community with all its varied interests.
1336	4313	2	3	I think that we should remove certain things like movies, music and books should definitely be a debate because in these days people are doing things that they never done before. For an example music, music is a great cause of things that people motivate to do things and get really into the songs. They try to do the same things as what there favorite artist or actor does. I hear some songs and they talk about illegal things and I look around the world I hear children talking about those things and they tell there parents what is that ? But they just dont want to tell them the truth but once these kids get older they will know what it is and it will be there choice if they want to follow that path or think about something else. But about the people who are singing this, they're putting it in a way that is not bad you could do this all the time and enjoy it with out getting introuble and in reality these kids are blind and dont know what there getting them selves into. Also, many books have offensive language that kids read all the time but people dont even notice. That's how kids could get introuble in school because they learn a new word in some book they never read or cant even read cause there to young to understand but they do it anyways beacause of curiosity, they dont know what there doing. Thats a way how a child becomes bad cause person when he or she becomes older cause they learned things that they shouldnt have learned. I think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and cant read, and it should depend how old is the person. Some school librarys, have movies that kids could watch and it could be if your a elementry school, middle school etc. But some of these movies have offensive language and some appropriate scenes, that kids would want and learn how to do those type of things. Or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think is cool cause there doing it as well. I think that elementry students should watch only pg movies, middle school pg @NUM1 and down, and for the high school, we should be able to see basically any movie, but in the same time I think most of the high school students have to be more mature, thats probably why we still dont have the priblige to see any movie cause peolpe dont know how to handle them selves. Finally, I really think they should minimum some movies, music and books cause kids are learning things they shouldnt be learning until they get older, and that those three things change the world in so many diffrent ways, some are good but most of them are bad, these are my opinions and I believe such measures are necessary to protect young minds.
1337	4314	2	3	There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions. Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people. However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library, or if a film is playing in a theater, they can simply choose not to watch it. In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also, and a balance of personal responsibility and consideration for others is the best path forward.
1338	4315	2	3	Personally in my opinion I have no problem with anything found in libraries today. Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but it's not hurting you so just ignore it. Kids don't walk around in the adult section of the library they go to the kid section so there is no need to worry about them. Kids are maturing at a much younger age these days. I believe there is no harm in libraries, it is a place where you go to get all the information you can. So why would you remove valuable information. The library is a place for all people no matter who you are, how old or ugly. Everyone can use the library for any reason, many times invloving school. Personally I do not much use public libraries, but I often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book. For example you might find @CAPS1 to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about. For me I am @CAPS2 I want to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is. So why take that information away from me. Taking away a learning experience just becuase a group of people don't like the book does not mean everyone dosn't like it. I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from. Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs. Overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome. It is a place to get away from it all, I think they should leave them just how they are, as bastions of free and open access for everyone in the community.
1339	4316	2	3	I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think. If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers and the library would no longer serve its true purpose for the whole community. If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their berth certificate. Have a resticted section in the library. In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed. Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own. This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you about this important matter.
1340	4317	2	3	I beleive that all materials should be allowed in libraries, because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to and watch. Even if people banned some books from the libray, other people would find a way to get them. we as the people of aAmerica have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely. As for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far. We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the @ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies, music, and television, which provide guidance for consumers. With magazines its a little more complicated than the others, maga zines have their own set of standards. We all know about @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2, but think about all of the magazines that we dont see. The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out, yet they still exist and are accessed by those who seek them. Ultimately, the freedom to access information, with reasonable guidance, is a cornerstone of our society.
1341	4318	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with a huge diversity. Fiction, romance, horror, fashion, science fiction, and many more categories of literature are made. There is something out there everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had an ill opinion of it? Everyone has an opinion. It may be in favor of something or it may not be. I believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people it might be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it. Someone may enjoy a piece of work that another finds offensive. It is all a matter of opinion. The opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not. If you walked into a library and the shelves were filled with books, but only books everyone had a good opinion about, the shelves wouldn't seem very full. It is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public library. Censorship is understandable to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections. In these categories and sections people can look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not. Libraries have rated R movies. Many people could consider rated R movies to be offensive, but many people could enjoy watching rated R movies. Who wins, the people who find them offensive or the people who enjoy them? It is a hard choice to make. I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them. The same goes for books, magazines, and music. If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it. There are hundreds of different styles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines. They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. They can not censor things just because some people find them offensive. Others may enjoy them. What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public library? The freedom to choose is a fundamental part of a library's purpose.
1342	4319	2	3	I do not think that books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should be removed just because some people do not like them. Maybe some others do like them and like to read them. There should be no reason that one person or persons should try taking something off of a shelf at a library just because they find it offensive. Many people like many different things and somethings that you read may affect others, but you don't care about that, you just care about what you want and like and what is offensive to you. What if something you were watching or reading or listening to was offending someone else, would you care? Would it bother you if someone told you it was offending them? Everyone likes different things, and some others may not always agree with what they are going to be interested in. The solution is not removal but personal responsibility and choice, allowing each individual to select what suits their own taste without imposing their views on the entire community.
1343	4320	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? What I am going to discuss about is do I believe certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I will also talk about my introduction, body and conclusion. Do I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and anything else on any book shelves or any other shelves that is offensive to anyone should be removed? I think this because nobody should be offended by anything. Everyone should not live offended by anything or anyone. I just explained and talked about if the offensive things on shelves should be removed, and I answered yes. I also talked about the introduction, a body, and conclusion. Ultimately, the goal is for everyone to coexist without feeling offended by the materials that are publicly available for individual choice.
1344	4321	2	3	It is known that anybody is able to rent books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries. It is also known that some of the material in libraries may be offensive or inappropriate. While some people believe that such items should be removed from the shelves, I believe that books, magazines, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves. People should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to; if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in their house then he or she doesn't have to get it, and it doesn't mean that something that seems offensive still isn't enjoyable. The most important reason why I believe that items that appear to be offensive should not be removed from library shelves is because people should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to. Anybody is entitled to his or her own preference. Some people prefer R rated movies or music with explicit content. If that's what people are interested in then so be it. Anybody should not have to stop renting something that they want just because someone else doesn't want them to. Furthermore, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in his or her house then just don't get it. No one is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something that they don't want. It is actually a very simple matter. It's a choice whether someone wants to watch or listen to what they want, and they don't really have the right to be able to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want. If someone doesn't prefer something then they don't have to get it. Finally, just because something seems offensive doesn't mean that it still isn't enjoyable. The best example that I can think of is a movie that is rated R. Just because a movie is rated R doesn't mean that it still doesn't have a good story or moral to it. There are plenty of rated R movies that have won Academy Awards and plenty of other rewards. Another example is the singer Eminem. While his music may be offensive, there are still many people that enjoy it. Certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people. In conclusion, no one has the right to be able to stop anyone from renting what they want from a library. People just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if certain people believe that they are. People can only choose what they want, and nothing more.
1345	4322	2	3	Do you believe that books or any different materials should be removed from the libraries shelf? No, because them books or materials is not for everybody to look at. Like if you have kids you should keep them in a kids area. We cannot just start taking down every book off the shelf because it was not a good book. The reason why kids should stay in the kids area is so they won't pick up that book that's not for them. We will need the child to be reading childrens books. If a kid picks up a bad book you should explain to them that this book is not for them. Some books are inappropriate for kids to read, so that's why they have their own area to be in. Kids should not leave their area for an inappropriate book. I think that kids should listen to appropriate music in a library. The inappropriate book or materials are not for the kids to read so they should not be in that area to pick up a bad book. I feel like there are no bad books out there; if you don't like the book maybe someone else will. But like movies, music, and magazines should not be off the shelf because if it was inappropriate it would not be in the library in the first place. Everybody is not going to like everything but that's just life, and libraries should reflect the diverse tastes of the community they serve.
1346	4323	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries or not? Many people have their own personal view on this subject. Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and other materials that they themselves have purchased to get. Now they want them censored? I don't think that is very right. Libraries should take all the censored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that might apply to that section. The library was built for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read. Not everyone goes to the library for a book, some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine, well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just to get. How do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library? The internet and television is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library. If libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries. Finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility. My opinion says we should just move the material elsewhere in the building, in its own little wing or something, where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to. Everyone has their own personal opinion on this subject, and well I gave you mine.
1347	4324	2	3	I think that any book or movie should have some warning signs upon it, to ensure that all people know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. Some movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people might not and if you take all of the stuff out of movies or books it might cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books. In a lot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't appreciate what they say in the song then don't listen to that group. There are some rap artists that say some things people might not like but, you don't have to listen to them there are a lot more bands and different kinds of music to choose from. It would be hard taking stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take a lot of what the people want to see. In magazines a lot of people including I like hearing the truth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that a lot of people might not know. If parents don't like their children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy having their kids read. Ultimately, it is better to provide information and let individuals make their own choices rather than removing content entirely.
1348	4325	2	3	My name is Sarah and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that is found offensive should be taken off the shelves. I have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. I'm not the type of person who would start an argument but I am a type of person who will speak what's on my mind and tell you what I believe in. People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that there will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, and etc. Like I said I have never came across a book that I think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course I don't read a whole lot either but the books I have read I have never came across any that were terrible. Books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldn't even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section. I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. Most authors are smarter than that, or at least I would hope so. Music is a whole story itself. In my opinion if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that I would never let my children listen to it but I know well enough if I don't want them to listen to it then I'm not going to play it while they're around. I grew up around rap music so that's all I listen to, but when I have kids I know what they will be able to listen to and what they won't be able to listen to. Movies is the one that I have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, Blockbuster, and book stores they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the 'Saw' movies. The name of the movies aren't bad but the movie itself is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it? Magazines and etc I don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can. The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out. I think I've said all I can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. I haven't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because I don't have kids yet, I guess I will find out when I do have kids. I am happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know.
1349	4326	2	3	Library Censorship. Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves. Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive. Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area. The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child might enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child might be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting. The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people might think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area. Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense. This approach respects individual choice while maintaining a responsible environment.
1350	4327	2	3	I think that certain books are fine if you take them out. You should be thirteen or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated R. I have read some books that are really good, but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book called 'A Child Called It' and it is really sad. It's about this child and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but it was sad, but I read it because people were talking about it. Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch it but I do. I'm thirteen years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes it because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell. Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, it makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie. I watched them before though. In the end, age restrictions and personal discretion are better solutions than complete removal of materials.
1351	4328	2	3	No, the books and other materials should not be moved from the library, because anybody can be interested in them. Someone could come into the library looking for any of those specific items and be unable to find them simply because the library removed them, which would defeat the purpose of a public resource. First, there will be no valid reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and other materials are coming in and space is a genuine issue. Everyone is into different materials, books and stuff, and personal tastes vary widely. That's why I say do not remove the items. People might come into the library looking for a specific book that they want or need. If that person cannot find it they might complain to the staff, or take their business elsewhere to another library or a bookstore. Then the library could start losing business and community support. Second, if the library starts losing business it might be forced to close down due to a lack of funding and patronage. Then if the library closes down the people who come there often, such as students or remote workers, won't have any place to study or work or nothing at all. What if those people don't have reliable personal transportation; they will not be able to get to another library that is farther away. The owner of the library can lose money and their investment if it closes down, because everyone doesn't have computers and extensive book collections at home. They can come to do their research and rent books for free or a low cost. Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is their only place for such an environment. Little children go to the library looking for books and other items too, and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying out of disappointment. If they start crying, people who are working or studying can be disturbed by the noise. Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and that's money and patronage lost. Students whose schools might not have the book they are looking for often come to the library, and if the library doesn't have it that student won't have access to a necessary book for their education. In conclusion, these are some reasons and examples why I don't believe the books and other materials should be taken out of the library. Someone can be really interested in those specific items and they come to the library to search for them and would be very disappointed if they can't find them available.
1352	4329	2	3	You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far too inappropriate and offensive for a public space. What would you do? Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, something that you believe is offensive, you should say something about it. You should talk to the librarian and calmly state your case about what is going on and why you find it concerning. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework and find books, is just plain wrong and irresponsible. What if that certain library had no restrictions whatsoever on who checked out what? So many young kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is or the content it contains! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disastrous for their development and your peace of mind! I do not have children of my own, but I do have younger cousins whom I care about. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inappropriate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian about the library's collection policies. Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who to prevent such situations. For example, my local library has three different kinds of library cards to manage access. One card is just to check out regular books from the general collection. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books from a broader media section. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section located in a small, separate room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older and show valid identification. I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some may find offensive, they need to be kept in a small, designated room at the back of the library, or perhaps behind the librarians desk where access can be monitored. This way, no one who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to be exposed to them accidentally. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need to show proof that they are eighteen or older, such as a driver's license. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials and ensure they are not reaching minors. Another thing to consider is, what if one person finds something offensive that someone else does not? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three different people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf completely. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should then place the book, magazine, movie, music, etc., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction for access. This is how it is at my neighborhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions to protect young patrons. If all libraries had more restrictions like these, it would be better off for everyone involved. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around the stacks and finding something that is totally wrong for them and their age group. Older teenagers and young adults would still be able to get their homework or research projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials being openly displayed. In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart and consider the importance of these measures. I hope you write an article talking about the need for sensible restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off for families and the community. Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider my perspective.
1353	4330	2	3	I believe that some materials in the library should be taken off the shelves. Some people may find them offensive because they might have bad things in them, such as explicit content or strong language. Some types of music, for instance, have bad language in them and people don't want little kids finding them and listening to them. If a little kid saw or heard that stuff then they would learn bad things and inappropriate words. And they would likely say it in front of everybody, perhaps at school or at home, and then other children might start saying it too, causing a problem for parents and teachers. A lot of books are perfectly ok to read because they don't have bad things in them and are suitable for all ages. Some people like reading books that have drama and intense plots, and some people don't, which is a matter of personal preference. Most books are generally ok to read and are harmless. But some books can have strong language in them and shouldn't be allowed in the open library sections where children can easily access them. But they can still be in the library collection because some adults might want to read them for their own interests. If people don't want to read them then they simply shouldn't get them; it is a matter of personal choice. Some movies also have bad stuff in there, like violence or adult themes. That kind of stuff should not be in the general collection because a lot of people don't want to watch movies like that, especially in a family environment. And if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent found out, then the library could get sued for having that material accessible to minors. So they should be taken out of the general library area so young people won't get them accidentally. The library can keep children's movies in there to watch because they are not bad and are age-appropriate. If I worked at a library then I would take certain magazines out of the main reading area. Sports magazines would be ok to keep in there because they are generally safe and about athletics. But a lot of the other ones should not be there on open display because they have a lot of bad things in there, like gossip or explicit images, and I wouldn't let people take them so I wouldn't have them in there. But sports and hobby magazines would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read about and are often educational. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read and follow their favorite teams. That is just what I think about the matter. Other people might see it the other way and they can have their own opinions; that is their right. People are different and they will think different things about what is appropriate. Some people might want to read that material and some people don't, which shows the diversity of public taste. So it just shows you that people are different because they think things differently than other people do. And some libraries have that stuff and some don't, based on their local policies. So if you are one of those people that like that stuff then you can go to one of the libraries that have that stuff in their collection. And if you are one of those people that don't then you can go to one that doesn't have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want, and everyone is satisfied.
1354	4331	2	3	I have seen some truly offensive books on the shelf of public libraries. Books that make you worry about what would happen if a child of a young and impressionable age looked at these books, since that is where their mind absorbs the most knowledge, but what if this knowledge was offensive to a race of people or a persons religion? These children are the future of our species and what they learn matters. This kind of material should be censored in libraries to protect them. Try to imagine if they had looked at books written by Adolf Hitler and other nazi members during nazi Germany's rule. Maybe they looked at a book by a serial killer or other famous murderers. If they saw a photo book about the massive Jewish death camps in europe, the images could be deeply traumatic. Movies that show war torn battlefields such as Normandy, Iwo Jima, world war one, or world war two could be too intense. The famous movie 'The Killing Fields', a movie based on the cruelty of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide, is another example of heavy content. This is my view on censorship; it is necessary to protect children from the offensive things in or on books, music, movies, magazines. There should be censorship in all things children can get into within a library. Imagine a world where there was no control over media and what they could put on for anyone to see; it would be a frightening place for a child to learn and grow up in, which is why we need these protective measures in our public institutions.
1355	4332	2	3	The library is a public place for the entire community. Everyone is allowed access to the library and its resources. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about, for education or for pleasure. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries, catering to diverse interests. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there in one location. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed, as it restricts access to knowledge and art. Genres were created for a reason, to help people find what they like. Certain items have different forms and categories to them. There are many forms of music, for example, each with its own style and audience. Classical, rock, and blues are just some examples of musical genres. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive to an individual, then that certain genre can be easily avoided by not going to that section. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds its content offensive; it is a simple matter of choice. In the United States the American people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one of these fundamental rights. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear the country apart and undermine its principles. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing and artistic expression. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there under this protection. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way; tastes are subjective. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library as long as it is legally produced. Another freedom given to the American people is the freedom of the press. Anything put onto paper is legal to publish and distribute. Criticizing the government or fantasising about fictional events, it is all legal and protected. Books can be offensive to many people depending on their viewpoints. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable and powerful. Like music, books have many categories and genres for organization. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what, as per the law. Movies are located at libraries as well for people to borrow. They are categorized just as much as books and music, often by genre and age rating. The term 'don't judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes, but not always. This can also be used with movies; the cover often gives clues. The title of a movie or book will often tell you what it is about or its general theme. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated R or NC-17 for a reason. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent by guiding viewers. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated R movie in its collection. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age, and libraries have policies to prevent this. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries as it contradicts the principle of free
1356	4333	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think it should matter whether we have music, movies, or magazines in the library, as these are all valid forms of media that serve different purposes for different people. Some people like to come into the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music, finding it a pleasant way to spend their time. I do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there; if it is not bothering them directly, it should not bother anybody else, as we all have different tastes and preferences. I see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music through their headphones, and it does not bother me when they do this. It is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book without external distractions. There is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library, and that is related to behavior, not content. It is that some people get very loud when they're looking at magazines in a group, or when their music is turned up way too loud and disturbs others seeking quiet. Other than that specific issue of noise, I do not think we should keep those types of materials out of the libraries, as they provide valuable services. I am a reader myself and I like to read in peace, so I understand the need for a quiet environment. So I like to listen to my music quietly while I am reading, and I also like to read magazines every once in a while, which I find to be really relaxing. Those are my reasons on why it should not matter whether we have those types of materials in the library, as their benefits far outweigh the minor inconveniences.
1357	4334	2	3	Do I think that books, movies, music, or magazines should be removed from the library? No, I don't. I think that they should be removed only if they cause a significant disruption, but removing them simply because someone finds them offensive would probably make you lose more customers, as people come to the library for a wide variety of materials. I'm going to be honest here, most people like to read, and the library is a vital resource for them. I know I sometimes read to study, and if they got rid of the books that I read to study, how would I be able to complete my work? Even teachers go to the library to study or to get books for their classes, or maybe to get books for their grandkids or their own kids, showing its importance to the community. Parents do the same thing, relying on the library for educational and entertainment resources for their families. People don't understand that music helps everybody at some point in time, providing comfort and focus. I know people who listen to music to help them concentrate on different things like homework, regular work, or even when they are feeling stressed out. There are a lot of different ways that music helps a lot of people, and it has been a positive force for many. If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that, then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no major complaints about the music selection. Honestly, I have never gotten movies or magazines from the library before, but I know many who do. People do it for their kids or grandkids, and I don't really see the big deal, as it provides affordable family entertainment. It's not like they are watching anything bad; they mostly have kid-friendly movies, not inappropriate ones. Why would people want to take little things like that away from little kids, who are just trying to enjoy a story? In a way, that makes me mad because I like little kids, and they don't hurt anybody by watching a harmless cartoon or reading a colorful magazine.
1358	4335	2	3	Did you know that libraries contain books, movies, music, magazines, and many other resources? Yes! They have it all, creating a wonderful hub of information and entertainment for the community. If you ever need something for research or a project, you can just go there and you will likely find what you are looking for. But if there is something on the shelf that you do not personally like, the simple solution is to just keep going and choose something else. I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive by some individuals. I think that if it is something that offends you, then you should just keep walking and select a different item that better suits your tastes. That 'something' that might offend you could be incredibly helpful or enjoyable to others, as we all have different perspectives and needs. So, now you know if you ever see something that you don't like in the library, the best approach is to just walk away and let others make their own choices. It could be helpful to you in the future and is certainly helpful to others in the present. If things that offend you are removed, how would the next person learn about different viewpoints or find the information they need? They won't, and that would be a great loss for the community. Don't only think about yourself in this situation; think about others and the greater good of shared knowledge and access.
1359	4336	2	3	I don't believe that we should censor or take away anything off of our library shelves that seems either offensive or inappropriate for viewers, as this restricts access to important knowledge. However, I wouldn't recommend it for the kids who are not ready for that sort of material until they are at an age where they are mature enough for that sort of viewing, and that is a decision for their parents to make. The reason why I say this is because I believe and know that people sooner or later are going to see, hear, and go through that sort of viewing and/or experience sometime in their lives; it has happened to many people and it will continue to happen to everyone. The events that happen to many people are awful but yet are true, and the difficult topics that go around in the world should be known to other people and understood. People need to know how to deal with a situation or at least know what to do; we should know how to act when certain events occur. For example, if a certain person of a race is minding his own business and passes a group of race oppressors and they begin offending him by words, then he shouldn't worry unduly. Because if a person is only going to constantly use words, then you should know that he or she is just a weak person trying to get on your nerves and likely won't do any physical harm to you. There are many harsh realities that people don't like and try their best to hide from others, but that would only make the situation worse for everybody. Keeping people in the dark would leave them clueless if they got exposed to what some people attend to hide; we shouldn't hide the truth from others and keep them from knowing what has happened or what is going on. I believe that nothing should be held back for the people who are ready to see or know what is going on in the world, no matter how cruel or painful the subject matter is. They should know what it is and how to take care of themselves when they experience it at first hand, as knowledge is the best preparation for life's challenges.
1360	4337	2	3	Censoring our history and ideas is a dangerous path. We all know that language is the foundation of human legacy, allowing us to pass knowledge from one generation to the next. Language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate, and written words capture those thoughts forever. To take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers and thinkers who came before us. We have the obligation to keep the stories and history that we have created alive for future generations. If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing ever happened, and if nothing happened, it will likely reoccur—whether the event was good or bad. To hide away words from our children is wrong and ultimately futile. If not by word of print, word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book, but perhaps in a less accurate form. But even more importantly, what good is hiding the truth? When many speak of tragic incidences, they speak, 'lest we forget.' If we should not forget, why should the youth not learn? There is nothing in print that cannot be conveyed in a different communication form, so censorship does not erase the idea. Our collective memory is written on the pages of literature, preserving our triumphs and failures. The books we read are the property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs, helping us to grow. A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' This novel is a work that displays what life was truly like in one of America's most racially barbaric times, offering a valuable historical window. One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times, which is understandably jarring. To understand the novel, one might argue that Jim, the enslaved man who stood by Huck, was genuinely loved by Huck as a friend. A book in that time period displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat. The 'n' word was common place in that time period—a genuine friendship between a black man and a white man was not. Is it really important that a child knows of just another offensive word that they are bound to discover eventually anyway, or is it more important that they learn that color of skin does not change a person's worth? Do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away by focusing only on the offensive language. To take one book away is to take all of them away, setting a dangerous precedent. Censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created, leading down a slippery slope. The world has seen what can happen when things get censored on a massive scale. During various dictatorships, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspapers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the regime wanted got through. The people were brainwashed by this controlled information, and those who were not and rose up were often shot down. Do not let the world come to that again; we must learn from history. We are better than that and our literature shows our capacity for complex thought and empathy. In other words, to censor media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of education and freedoms that are critical to the well being of future generations. Do not hide the free speech of authors, do not hide our history from our children, do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before. Let us educate our children thoroughly for the future of humanity. Let our history not repeat its worst chapters. Let us innovate and create a new, better world based on knowledge. Let us allow our words to flow freely as they were meant to. Let us allow our legacy to live on, uncensored and complete.
1361	4338	2	3	The author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a children's shelf to read, but rather on an adult shelf where access is more controlled. I believe every author has his or her right to express oneself and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we don't agree on their beliefs. If every book that was found offensive was taken off a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain things offensive, and there is no universal standard for what is acceptable. Many children are interested in certain things and we can't hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes against family morals or values such as religious beliefs. It would be a good thing to monitor what your children are reading, watching and listening to, guiding them towards age-appropriate content. On the other hand, adult shelves will have many different things that would be offensive to many different people, unlike children's books which are generally curated. Writing is a way to show a person's expressions and what they stand for although it may not be pleasing to me or any other person. But what if we write a book and somebody does not like it then we wouldn't like it if they took it off the shelf. That would show disrespect to a person who has thought long and hard on their work. Learn to stand proud on what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books, music and magazines, fostering an environment of both freedom and responsibility.
1362	4339	2	3	I am against censorship for good reasons. Everyone is for censorship, well I'm on a different perspective. If you are not old enough to get a movie or a book that's for a reason, as these ratings exist to protect the young. On another note if you are an adult then it shouldn't matter what you choose to consume. People should have their own choice in these matters. If they want to go out and get a rated R movie and watch it with their kids that's their own choice as parents. It's definitely not the person who makes the movie's choice to censor curse words and stuff out; the creator's vision should be respected. That's why they make edited CDs so people can buy them instead if they so desire. People have different beliefs, and it's whatever they believe in is how it should go for them. And if somebody else with different beliefs doesn't like that then I guess they need to write a paragraph like I'm doing now to express their own view. Also, people want everything censored out, but eventually there isn't going to be nothing left to read, watch, or listen to if we remove all offensive content. So all you people that want everything to be censored, I hope you're happy when the world has nothing to do because of your efforts to sanitize all creative expression.
1363	4340	2	3	Censorship for the future kids of America is a topic that requires careful thought. Personally I have read some disturbing books and also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated R movies. Not even talking about all the messed up music I've heard so far in my lifetime, which has shaped my views. What it comes down to is a lot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids by providing guidance. Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang violence, and all the horrible reality of the devilish deeds in the world. I personally don't have a kid but if I had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated R movie I would wanna file a complaint because that's not how I want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth is not the future I envision. Also I wouldn't want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth; it's about respect and upbringing. But the library association needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until they're old enough to go get it on their own, like they need to be seventeen to go see a rated R movie. That is how it should have always been, with clear boundaries to protect the young while allowing adult access.
1364	4341	2	3	I feel that materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people like offensive things that they have in the library; it caters to their interests. Some people would sometimes want to know about certain things that is offensive, seeking understanding or perspective. Most materials could be offensive to a lot of different people for various reasons. Different individuals have different things that are offensive to them personally. What might be offensive to you is probably not offensive to me, and that is the core of the issue. People that don't like offensive things just shouldn't check it out, and people that like offensive things just could check it out; the choice should be theirs. I feel that they just shouldn't be removed just because some people don't like offensive things; they just shouldn't check it out themselves. You just can't remove things that are offensive just because some individuals don't like offensive things. Everyone does have their own right but some people like offended things, and their rights matter too. I read a book that was offensive to me, but it told me how to react to the situation and how to overcome my situation, providing valuable insight. So some things may offend you, but some things you just have to read about it more because some things tell you how to overcome that situation or it will tell you what to do about the situation you had been offended by. That's why I feel that you shouldn't remove offensive books, as they can offer unexpected lessons and growth.
1365	4342	2	3	Moving Forward The Difficult Things In Life! When you enter a library or a book store of course you will find things that you like and dislike; that is the nature of a diverse collection. Your opinion may not be the same as someone else's, and that is perfectly acceptable. Sometime you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way things are going when confronted with challenging material. People have different looks about different things in this way of life. You are going to come across good things, bad things, happy things, sad things, things you agree about, and things you disagree about; such is the spectrum of human experience. I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody. The reason I state that is because if any of those items offended one person they might not be offensive to another, highlighting the subjectivity of offense. Different people have different interests in many different subjects and genres. So therefore it should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves, especially if they are not hurting anything or anyone physically. Speaking from personal experience there were many times I felt offended about certain topics. I feel that abortions can come off a bit harmful to a life that has not been born yet, which is a deeply personal belief. Killing a child that has not experienced the things you have is not right from my perspective. But some sometime the way I can feel can be a lot different to other people, and I acknowledge that. So who am I to tell another person what they can and can not do? That comes with voicing your own opinion while respecting the rights of others. You can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling, as thoughts and emotions are personal. If you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with it is crazy to demand its removal for everyone. Think about the difficult situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you; others may find value in it. It will be a lot of times you will disagree or have an opinion but can not change or do anything about it, and that is part of living in a pluralistic society. Things will be much easier and less difficult if we sometimes deal with the difficult things in life with understanding and tolerance, rather than through removal and censorship.
1366	4343	2	3	No, they should not have the CDs, books, and other materials removed from the store shelves; they should leave them on the shelves, I think. They should only remove the genuinely outdated media, such as old video games, and perhaps obsolete reference books and music formats that are no longer in use. Every other type of current and relevant material should remain available for the public to access and choose from, ensuring the collection meets the diverse needs and interests of the entire community. It is important to maintain a wide selection for everyone.
1367	4344	2	3	In many public libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of books, magazines, movies, and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and may find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays? Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy, and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library don't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if there is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in public libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries. There is a reason that public libraries are called public. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a public library. That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the 'Adult Fiction' section of your library. For example, Stephen King, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the 'Adult Fiction' sections or even the 'Horror' section. It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself. I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the public. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the Adult Fiction section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big warning to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself.
1368	4345	2	3	Should books, magazines, etc., really be censored, taken off a shelf in a library, just because you might find them offensive? Some of you who are reading this would say yes, but why? What would be the reason behind it? So to answer the first question I asked, my answer would have to be no, because a library is a public place for all ages, and each area is labeled or should be labeled with the genre of book, magazine, etc., that it is. I myself read almost just about everything I can get my hands on, and for some people it's the same way. Yes, I understand that if it is offensive to you that you probably would feel they should censor it, but what about those that it isn't offensive to? What would you say to them? How would you explain why it was offensive? Most of all, how would you react if they held it against you? If it was because of one person or a small group of people that one of my favorite books or series was censored, in all honesty I would be pretty ticked. Books are for everyone to read; they shouldn't not be able to read the books they love because they have been taken off the shelf. I think that if a person really doesn't like the book and finds it offensive, they should then just ignore it and move on to find another book; they shouldn't have looked at it in the first place. Books will be offensive to someone somehow; usually a book is written to target a certain group of people. For instance, what if someone found the romance novels a lot of people love, offensive? What if that was all the person read? Well, the people who only read romance novels wouldn't have a book to read because someone had them censored and taken off the shelves. Books have been written to help teach, to get away from the real world, to create a place to go for a person with an imagination, to give someone hope, mystery, and excitement. Books aren't something that should be taken off a library shelf; they are a bit of something for someone who just loves to read. Yes, there would be books you don't want your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews to read, but that can't be helped; you can't censor every book that you don't want them to read or find offensive for them. If you did, there wouldn't be a single book on a library shelf. So for those of you who have read this, think about it: when you pick up a book and find it offensive, do you want to make someone else upset because you had it taken off the shelf? You never know when that might happen to you, so think about it before you go and try to do that to a book.
1369	4346	2	3	I don't believe that any certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the libraries shelves, because any thing can be offensive. What if someone needed to research about the Holocaust? Well, they really won't be able to if all the books about the Holocaust were taken off the shelves, only because someone found it offensive. Nowadays, everything is offensive to somebody. For this, people need to understand that it is what it is, and if you were not a part of that problem, then what do you need to worry about? This day and age is evil all around the world. There are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive. Just like all the earthquakes around the world, I know that there are some people offended about that, but what if somebody was in college and they wanted to learn more about what happened so maybe they can get a group of people and make their lives better? People are hurting and I understand that, but we people are not here to judge; we are here to help the poor and the sick, get by with what they have, and just help them see that there is a way out. With all this said, I don't believe that we should remove the books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves in libraries, as they serve as vital resources for education and understanding.
1370	4347	2	3	When I go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic. The information I want is the facts that really happened or took place. This would not be possible if they censored all the material that offended somebody. Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading or researching. It is important for readers and researchers to connect and take in all the information they read. That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing. Authors write the things they write for a reason. Taking their hard work off the shelves because some little thing offends someone is not fair to them. Besides, either way, someone is getting offended, because the author is going to get offended for taking his hard work off the shelves. As you can tell, I am against censoring our libraries. The way I see it is that if something offends you, then don't look at it, but do not seek to limit access for others who may need or appreciate that very material for their own purposes and growth.
1371	4348	2	3	I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their beliefs or ideas, as this freedom is fundamental to a creative and open society. If certain books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read, as nearly every work could be deemed objectionable by someone. If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate, thereby taking personal responsibility. In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things about the world and themselves.  Books can also help children to escape from every day life, offering a safe haven for their minds. Admitedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionaly they need too for their mental well-being. I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things, which provided great comfort. If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers by returning to their responsibilities refreshed.  Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations, opening doors to new worlds and possibilities. If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life, developing critical thinking skills. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination? It is impossible to be uninteresting when you have a mind full of stories and ideas!  In recent online polls, parents who's children can access books say that their children do better in school and in every day life, showing a clear correlation. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies, encountering new words in context. With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease, giving them a significant advantage.  In conclusion, If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read, depriving them of these vital benefits. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life. Do not let libraries censor books and limit the intellectual and emotional growth of the next generation.
1372	4349	2	3	Some materials in libraries contain information that is offensive towards others, causing genuine hurt and discomfort. But should they be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is and the potential harm it causes. But materials should be removed if it is a sexual, racist, or life threatening offense, as these categories represent significant harm.  Some material may have offensive comments that is sexual in nature, which can be deeply unsettling. If its an offense that is sensored and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that could be a good reason for the material to be removed from public access. It can make the person feel emotions that bring them down, causing distress and anxiety. It may also make the person feel violated and offended, impacting their sense of safety and well-being.  There can be material that has racist comments, which perpetuate harmful stereotypes and divisions. Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today, leading to discrimination and injustice. It is something that starts fights and arguements, disrupting community harmony. It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves, damaging their self-esteem and sense of belonging. Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also, leaving deep emotional scars. So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed to protect individuals from such harm.  There are some material that might have offense that seems life threatening, creating a sense of imminent danger. Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that could seem like the nation would be in danger, someone might feel offended and want that material removed for public safety. Material with too much threat in it can make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen, fostering a climate of fear. They would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves to restore a sense of security.  So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves? Yes they should, when they cross certain boundaries. If they were to be found sexually, life threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions that undermine their right to a safe and respectful environment.
1373	4350	2	3	Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech, which is a cornerstone of our society. There is not a point to it, as it undermines the very principles of intellectual freedom. People in this country have the right of speech, a fundamental liberty. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard, to share your perspective with the world. An author's opinions may be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice? Writers get their ideas from somewhere and society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the United States have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.  Writers might state things that to some degree could offend one in a million people, as it is impossible to please everyone. Others see it as freedom of speech and writing, a necessary part of a vibrant culture. An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders, but is often writing for a mature audience. But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing, as literature reflects reality. Some books may be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else. Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers, influencing their narratives. So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world, holding a mirror to society.  Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words; it merely ignores these realities. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex, from various sources around them. Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways, through television, music, and the internet. If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change, as the behaviors exist independently. There is no perfect society, and pretending otherwise is naive.  Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone, as no one is forced to read it. If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library, exercising personal choice. No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by; they can simply select another. Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence, depriving others of potential value. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers, as it is a repository of diverse ideas. If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it, a simple and effective solution. No one has glued their fingers to it, forcing them to continue.  Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to, as ideas cannot be so easily contained. Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things, as it avoids addressing the root issues. Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it, allowing others the freedom to decide for themselves.
1374	4351	2	3	One could understand why some would wish to censor libraries and remove all rude, unwanted, or offensive forms of media from thier shelves, seeking to protect vulnerable minds. However, one must take into account that, as Katherine Paterson said, if one person has 'the right to remove that [a] book from the shelf...then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else,' leading to a chaotic removal of all content.  With that thought in mind, do we honestly think that censorship of libraries is a smart idea? If everyone was able to pick and choose which books to be taken off the shelf or which music to ban, then we would have nothing left, an empty repository. You simply cannot please everyone, as tastes and sensitivities vary widely. Are there benefits? Of course there are benefits, such as shielding children from mature themes. One certainly wouldn't want one's child exposed to certain material at a young age. But one must not censor libraries for the whole community! If one wishes, as a responsible parent, that their child keep away from a particular book or movie, they should take that matter into their own hands and not condemn the book off the shelf, thereby respecting the rights of others.  By condemning the book, one condemns the author and their creative expression. As an American, one has the freedom of speech, and this applies to media as well, protecting diverse viewpoints. The author has the right to author a book that some may view as offensive, and no one has the right to remove his or her right from the standing, as this is a protected liberty.  Paper burns at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. In the classic novel by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451, the protagonist struggles through life in a world antagonized by the banning and burning of books. The story takes place in the future, however, it contains an interesting undertone that hints at the possiblity that this 'future' may be nearer than first imagined, serving as a cautionary tale. To be blunt, the protagonist's life is horrible, he lives in a world that bans books, yet he is quite the bibliophile, creating a deep internal conflict. He is employed as a fireman, not to clear fires, but to create them, a twisted duty. Bradbury's firemen are responsible for the delicate task of book burning, which is a rather frequent occurance, symbolizing the destruction of knowledge. However, with the main character's love for literature, how can he burn books? This is his central dilemma.  Throughout the novel, the character tries to come to terms with himself and attempts to put an end to the madness, only to be forced out of civilized society, becoming an outlaw. The book is freightening, but an amazing read: it emphasizes the dire reality of censorship and its consequences. It's everywhere, a pervasive force in his world.  Now, one certainly doesn't need to worry about Bradbury's futuristic hell, coming to life any time soon, but the symbolism remains powerful. But one should know the dangers of censorship and how it can escalate. No one person has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they feel is offensive, let alone ban it entirely, as this sets a dangerous precedent. The banning of books, is a banning of freedom itself. Freedom of speech, freedom of ideas, freedom of thought are all compromised. Another disutopian world that comes to mind is the world of George Orwell's 1984. Though, granted, our society is certainly not headed for that any time soon, if ever: it is still a valid point about the slope of suppression. Once some freedoms are removed, others will follow, eroding liberties gradually.  Libraries should remain entirely intact, forever, as bastions of knowledge and free inquiry. Every person, every man, woman and child should have ample access to knowlede, which is essential for an informed citizenry. Whether this knowledge be gained through books, magazines, movies or music, it needs to be readily avaliable in its diverse forms. Instead of banning certain media, one should label said media with a warning, providing guidance without removal. Parents should have enough sense to pay attention and thus, the problem is solved without imposing on others, fostering responsible consumption.  Censorship is wrong, censorship is unnessesary, and there are a plethora of alternative means for protection against pottentially 'offensive' media that do not involve removal. Thus, the case can rest with the knowledge that all forms of media need to availiable, no matter what the content, to preserve the fundamental principles of a free and open society.
1375	4352	2	3	There are many books out there that parents would not want there children reading, containing themes they find troubling. Some books have violence and crimes, others have love and romance, covering the full spectrum of human experience. But it is not the best idea to use censorship in libraries, as it limits access to important perspectives. There are many books out there that might not be good for children to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life by presenting consequences. Also, we can not forget about freedom of the press, a constitutional right that protects publishers and authors.  With freedom of the press anyone can write about anything they want, exploring all subjects freely. They can write about the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance, providing a complete picture of the world. Everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination, which is the source of unique stories. Without imagination what fiction would there be for children to read? Their world would be poorer for it. There would be nothing to write about without imagination, stifling creativity. With censorship, there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read, as so many contain something someone objects to.  If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor, some element that could be challenged. Wethear it is swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love, nearly every narrative contains potentially sensitive material. There is something in every book that is innapproperate for children to read from someone's viewpoint, making universal suitability impossible. If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would nothing left to
1376	4353	2	3	the scary book that you dont want your children to pick up off the shelf i think if your kids read it they would be scared having night mares and you probaly dont want that and if u have the right to move it your kids will have the right to move it because they see what you do they gonna wunt to do so u can do it when they are not around  and yea i believe that cetrtain materials should be kept away from young eyes to prevent such fear and distress, as protecting a child's peace of mind is a parent's primary concern.
1377	4354	2	3	Have you ever picked up a piece of material while in a library and it offended you? Would you want your children reading, watching, or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them? I don't think no parent wants that. Think about it, how do children have access to things like that? Is it all around or do children go and find it? Not every single child in the community is going to be protected from bad materials. Most of the time after school, children stay in the house and do stuff instead of going outside. Inside of their house they have access to televison, computers, and music. They think why go outside when I have all this stuff inside? Truth be told children hear so much harmful things from everywhere and anywhere. Nothing is censored like it was back in the day. Now a days nobody cares if materials are offensive, just as long as they sell. That's not the way it suppose to be at all, everybody should want best for the children and young teens. People wonder why their is violence, bad attitudes, crimes, etc., because all the stuff we have access to. Schools could help prevent this probelm by removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries. It's sad that type of material is available in a school, but thats how the generation is today. In a library only certain things should be done. Reading, using computers, working at a table. Children shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games, or listen to music with bad words in it, or prehaps pick up a dirty magazine. Library should be a place for learning, doing work, and reading. If their is less offensive materials in a school enviorment that's one step into fixing this problem. Censorship is much needed everywhere, it would help out a lot by creating a safer and more focused space for our children to grow and learn properly.
1378	4355	2	3	The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand. Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free access to all media-related materials, we take away the opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is. The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the slew of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that citizens have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the nation. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries. The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries. The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship. All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as a society with rights, employ a system of censorship.
1379	4356	2	3	I thimk kids should be abole to read what they wont. Kids should never get told no when it omes to lurning. Plus there is not a bad book that your kids will find at school any way. Why should kids not babull to watch and read what they wont. This is how we lurn and grow. Un less it was of adult kontent. Witch would be agest the law for them to get. haha Our kids minds are not something we should wast on things that they dont wont to read any way. When a kids starts to hate his or her work. It starts a loug chain of hateing school and the books inside it. This cycle can discourage a child's natural curiosity and love for learning, which is the true foundation of a good education.
1380	4357	2	3	I don't think that certain materials in books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because I think that everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but I do think some things in books, movies, and music that might be appropriate for a high school student aren't appropriate for an elementary school student. Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students, it would just depend on what they are reading, watching, and hearing. I've never experienced anything offensive in what i've read in any book before but I have experienced some in music i've heard. I didn't say really anything about it I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to and I didn't think it would really be that bad. It's mostly in rap music that i've heard that's really offensive and I think shouldn't have been even written. But I still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say, and it is ultimately up to individuals and parents to choose what they consume and what they allow their children to be exposed to.
1381	4358	2	3	We all have our favorite books and some we like others may not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maybe a book a friend recommended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are books that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away. To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because they could be offensive to some people because of racial slurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like Huckleberry Finn for example, may be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future. Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has their preference on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others might not. If all books that are bad or offensive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendous it may be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them. I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want.
1382	4359	2	3	Killings, murders, and homosexual books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken away. That is like saying I get offended by homework, take it out of the school. Some of the most interesting books to read are about murders, I think. I believe they shouldn't be taken out or else no teenage kids would read in the library. Teenagers like to have mystery and romance. I know that one of my favorite books, The Murder Mystery, would offend some people because it has murder in it. That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me. They can just overlook these books and pick another. If you want to keep your high school students interested you shouldn't take out books that might offend someone. By taking out some books not everyone would be happy. Some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library. Every book in one way or another would offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and read a different one. I have seen some books at my school that offended me, but I did not tell the librarian to take it out of the library. Another student might have loved to read that book. Everyone has different opinions so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones. The only books that would be left would be Dick the Cat and children books. I do not know of any high school student that would want to read Dick the Cat and give a speech about it in class. I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports any more; all the books we read in class could offend someone. If everything that offended someone was taken out of the school there would be nothing left of the library. See everyone has a different opinion on everything. That just isn't right. In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and libraries. They keep the high school students reading and growing. Without some of these books I myself wouldn't like reading. So lets be mature adults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us.
1383	4360	2	3	Censoring any type of media such as books, magazines, movies, or music from a library is not right. A library is a huge amount of information put in common places for people to seek out knowledge. When something is found offensive, you should not hide it away as though it was never there. If any media is offensive, it should be the person who is looking up the information to choose if he or she wants to use it. When someone, for example a child, encounters something offensive, the first thought is to take it away from the library or television. Instead, just explain what it is they are looking at and they will eventually understand the reason it is offensive, but how does someone know what is offensive or not? Just because something is found offensive by one or two people does not make it right to just take it away. It should be talked about or discussed by groups of people on the subject then decided whether or not it should be taken off the shelves for being offensive. If there is a book or magazine on the shelf and it might be offensive, it should be a decision made by the people surrounding that type of information to take it off the shelf and not to be hidden away from public access entirely.
1384	4361	2	3	Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, whether we take it away or not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of relieving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression. Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hide such things from their children. This makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hide it, the more children will seek it out. In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. It relieves stress, rage, and shows this so that there is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagine someone truly angry in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' There, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him. In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also show grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story, allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and buy the music, book, or movie. It puts interest into the material. Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, interest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that interests them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab, promote and keep some within it, be removed?
1385	4362	2	3	Do you think that something should be taken off the book shelf just because it offended someone or you disliked it? I don't think so. Just cause you don't like something or you don't approve of the reading material doesn't mean it should be taken away. If it was like that all the time than there wouldn't be any reading material or books or magazines left for anyone to enjoy. In my opinion if it offends you in some way or another than don't read it. Plain and simple. Because I'm sure that there's thousands of books, magazines, newspapers, etc, that offends a lot of people everyday in some manner. I don't mean to be harsh in any way, that's just the way I feel. This is only my opinion, that is how I feel about this situation and the removal of books from shelves.
1386	4363	2	3	Have you ever thought about why teenagers are changing each day? Sometimes parents don't pay attention to why that is happening, because they think their kids are growing up or because they need more freedom or even because they need more time alone. When time passes, they stop and think, what happened to my kids, why are they changing so much? But they don't know why we behave like that. You have to stop that, because we are changing because of what we see on magazines, movies, and books, and also music; sometimes music has offensive words that we learn and then repeat. But also music, books, magazines, and movies are good, but only when they don't have offensive words or bad things in them. Sometimes they affect us in a good way, but the majority of the time they affect us in a bad way because we learn bad things from them. Sometimes little kids read books with bad and offensive words without anyone knowing. I remember when my friend and I were @NUM1 years old she started reading books with offensive words, and her mom got mad at her. After that, she started insulting her mom and calling her names and her mom was feeling bad, but she didn't know why her daughter was acting so badly. The next day I went to their house and I told her mom that she was reading bad books and watching movies with offensive words, and I told her mom where she was hiding all those books and movies. When she got home I was there and her mom had all the books and movies in her hand and she gave me a bad look and she told me that I was a bad friend because I told her mom. I started crying because she made me feel bad but she didn't know that I was doing it for her own good. Before I moved to the @LOCATION1 she went to my home and she said 'I am sorry because I treated you like that', and I told her that I did it because I loved her and because she was like my sister since we were little. We started crying; now we are still best friends. These days, little kids know everything and it is because of what they watch and see. You can help us by taking all of the bad words and offensive words out of the books, movies, and magazines. Help us to become someone important in life by protecting us from harmful content.
1387	4364	2	3	Okay, some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad. Like this one sports magazine I read talked about some athletes and their accidents in a way that was embarrassing. For example, one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basketball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing because he had to use the bathroom a lot. I mean, who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves? That's just bad! And another thing, why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them? There are quite a few books that are like that. For an example, there's this book called 'Wake' and it's about a girl who gets pulled into other people's dreams. Like, there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual; I thought, wow, why is this book in here? It also had a lot of cursing in it. I enjoyed the story, but I think it should be removed from the library because there are kids that aren't of age so they shouldn't read them. I don't know, that's all I have to say right now, other than to look at what your kids read these days because you might get upset by what they find.
1388	4365	2	3	Katherine stated that if everyone had the right to take a book off the shelf then there wouldn't be any books left. I think what she is saying is that many people think of a book that is inappropriate, but in another person's eye the book could also be appropriate. Censorship is a big deal now-a-days. Nobody wants their young children to read about drugs and/or violence. I have many opinions upon this issue. First I will state why I think the books, or movies, or whatever should be taken off the shelf. The books, movies, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelf for being too inappropriate. The books and movies are inappropriate by having drugs, sex, violence, and many other things in them that young children shouldn't be subject to watching or reading. I know if I was a parent I would not want my young child reading of a violent murder, or about gangs. The other thing about censorship is that it is the people's choice to read an inappropriate book, or watch an inappropriate movie. As a kid myself that is growing up, I didn't really care for reading anyways, but the books that were the best sometimes were the ones with violence in them. Also, even though the book @MONTH1 be inappropriate, the child still should have a say in what they are reading. This is where my next thought comes in. You have to think about the kids that are mature too. The kids that are mature, and for whom it is just a hobby to read, @MONTH1 not have any books of their style left to read if they were all 'taken off the shelf'. This goes for parents too. If they have a book at their house, the child could easily pick it up and read it there. What the book stores, libraries, and movie stores should do, is put an age limit on the books and movies. I know that for @CAPS1 rated movies there is an age limit, but for explicit books I do not think there is an age limit. They could also maybe even get a letter or a note with parent consent on it, so the children could get the book or magazine. Maybe the parent should even just come in and get the book or movie for the child. The libraries, or book stores, or movie stores could also easily put a warning on the side of the cover to show that the book @MONTH1 be inappropriate to some. What the children read is only up to two people: the child and the parent. If the parent doesn't care that the child is reading or watching an inappropriate movie then it should be no problem. Therefore, I think in order to withhold the buying and selling of books, there has to be the option to obtain the inappropriate ones. I feel that even though the material @MONTH1 be explicit, the kids, with their parent's consent, should have the option to check out or buy mostly anything. After all, the book @MONTH1 be about violence, drugs, or sex, but the children are still reading which is always a good thing in itself.
1389	4366	2	3	I do agree with this topic at hand; some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropriate or sometimes vulgar. Way too @MONTH1 people get away with way too many things in this day and age. Our society we live in is just a total wreck and a complete, utter disaster. Something has to be done to put an end to this madness. Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropriate book up on the shelf, that @CAPS1 is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book. Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entertainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing; why would we put them on a shelf to be publicly displayed? That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to. I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip-hop music coming from my nine year old sister's room. I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutely awful; @CAPS1 was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol. I went in her room and turned @CAPS1 off and questioned her where she got the @ORGANIZATION1 from. She replied 'the library.' That's just another example of what I'm speaking about. If someone at the age of nine can check out a @CAPS2.D. like that, then imagine what is available to me at the age of sixteen. Adolescents do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary. I'm just afraid for the next generation; what are they going to be listening to? What are they going to be reading? And @CAPS1's not just the library, @CAPS1's everywhere! We can't even live a day of our lives in this society without hearing something bad on the radio, on TV, or even in public. Everywhere we turn is something bad or vulgar. So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit. We need to stand up for what's appropriate and what's right for everyone.
1390	4367	2	3	I don't believe that we should remove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons. This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see. Life is about learning new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about them or see them somewhere. The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a truly negative effect on them. If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even though it is what many kids are reading about today. Of course, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics. If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life. Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life. Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read and the media we consume. Also, everyone today listens to music. We find music as a way to relax and have a good time whether you're riding in a car or at a party. Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them. Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today. What many people don't see though, is that these songs often have a true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life for the artist. Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries. Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete. We watch movies to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while. No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for certain audiences. I strongly believe that removing any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on a lot of people. You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people. How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed? What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore for learning and enjoyment.
1391	4368	2	3	I believe that the book that none of us read should not be on the shelf of any book store. I think if the grown up does read it, no child should have the right to. Also, some of the music that is on the shelf should be removed from all stores. Children under the age of @NUM1 shouldn't have any way to get some of this rated R music; certain music shouldn't be on shelves for little kids to get a hold of. So now let's get to the movies that are playing in some of these shows. No child under @NUM1 should be able to see half of the things that are showing in movies because no child should be exposed to such things that grown ups are most likely exposed to. That is another way that young children are doing half of the things that they are doing; the people that make certain movies need to think about the children and how they would act toward the ones they make. Most magazines that are being sold today are giving children the wrong idea. When magazines are filled with a lot of he-say-she-say things, the kids in the world do nothing but think it's for real or okay to do, which sends off the wrong message to the young children. And I know you are thinking to yourself how is that true; well, kids these days listen to whatever they think is right, and half of these magazines make things sound so real and convincing. It is clear that greater care must be taken with the media we allow our children to access.
1392	4369	2	3	I think people use books from the Mexico that work; you have book rights when you hope our people right good is to important. I like book reading time when in my family it finally happens. Many people like reading books so much; people go to the bookstore and my family does too, so you're right to call me for more information. Rights for books will be scored fairly in school and book conventions are to have a structure that helps benefit from content because it is to help many people look to a special interest like a show or party when it finally happens and people are there. Sometimes it is a real book that matters. When I came to school I was not reading natively, so I go to my room; my reading one book is good for you, so I read. I like one book I go, I have, I read book so when I go on vacation I pack two books to read on the beach. When back to school I like book reading; my family, you like book, yes, why is good reading? I see my family he to reading one book to like to much reading. It is a simple and enjoyable part of our lives that brings us together.
1393	4370	2	3	No, I as an @CAPS1 citizen do not feel that any materials should be removed. There are many reasons I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. There are three main points supporting my opinion. First and foremost is the fact that this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least that's what the national anthem tells me. So to me, if someone removes a book or movie from a library because they find it offensive, they are trying to take away one of my rights as an @CAPS1 citizen. The right they are messing with, to me, is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book I wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie I choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away, if they make it so I can't get to it, then they are messing with my freedom, and this is something I can't stand as an @CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch whatever I choose to. Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there does not mean that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book, good for them, don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie, good for them, don't watch it. It is rather quite simple in my opinion; if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everyone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offensive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There are @MONTH1 five million other people out there who love said book, so why ruin it for everyone just to make a few people happy? They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say I can't. Finally, people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not appropriate for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents' job to make sure a child is not reading or watching something they shouldn't. If a child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad, it is the parents' job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completely remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it. So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right to make our own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch whatever we choose. It is not fair to get rid of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of others might love it, and like I said before, if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it, but don't ruin it for everyone else though.
1394	4371	2	3	Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can ever make everybody happy; that is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books and other materials that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether the materials are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying '@CAPS1't judge a book by its cover?' @CAPS2, well that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it. The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It @MONTH1 help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily. The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you @CAPS1't like it, @CAPS1't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves. No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place; people are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens.
1395	4372	2	3	Some books are offensive but not all of them. Some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive. I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries. One reason I do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it. Some libraries do not carry @PERSON1 books because he uses curse words. They should not remove the books completely; they should just warn people of the language inside. A second reason why I do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed. I once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the @CAPS1 religion. This was a horrible action because the @CAPS1 religion is an extremely interesting one and now many people will never know anything about it from that source. A third reason is that they @MONTH1 end up offending some people by removing a book. I once heard of an @CAPS3 family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the @CAPS3 religion. I found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books that they want to read. I propose that instead of censorship the libraries separate the books by different subjects and genres then put up signs warning anyone that goes into that section. This way everyone can get the books that they want to get and the libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended unnecessarily. I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries; some books are offensive but not all of them, and access to information should be preserved.
1396	4373	2	3	Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It might be the way they were brought up, or simply what they believe. I do not believe that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal opinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world, which is an impossible and arrogant assumption. If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part. I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they should be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind. This parental guidance is a natural and necessary part of upbringing, but it should not extend to controlling the choices of the entire community.
1397	4374	2	3	At Jeffersonville High School, we don't have the right to remove a book from the shelf just because we find its content disagreeable. If there is a book that is not for you, then simply do not get it, just like you would avoid a bad movie. It is similar to getting a bad lunch; if you see something you do not like, you are not going to get it, so why would you seek out a bad book or a movie that you know you will not enjoy? The principle of personal choice should prevail in our library, allowing everyone to select materials that align with their own interests and values without imposing their personal preferences on others. This approach respects individual autonomy and fosters an environment where diverse materials can coexist for the benefit of all students who wish to access them for their own educational or personal reasons.
1398	4375	2	3	Censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book, song, movie, or magazine is found offensive in any way. Mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools. Censorship was originally started during the 'Middle Ages' in Europe with the Catholic Church. It was used to hide information from the public by taking all records of it away from the public's use. In America, we are a democracy, but we still choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people. In some parents' opinions books are great and educational for children, but in other parents' opinions books do things like promote homosexuality, use false language, or even show drug use. Most of these books are not trying to promote these things but they are just part of the story. So pretend like we hide all the bad events or situations in the world from occurring in front of our children. They have no knowledge of this part of life, so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up? We can't just hide drugs from them; we can read these books and teach them the harm drugs can do to someone and how to avoid them. If we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs, things will get out of control. The majority of these books that contain 'harmful' things for children actually teach lessons that parents don't think of; they just think of what is written down on the paper instead of the moral overall lesson that the story is bringing to a child. If a story has false language, our child will ask us what these words mean and we will tell them not to use them and what they mean so the child knows not to repeat them. If not, they can go into school and another child will tell your child to say these words and your child, not knowing the meaning of the word, will go out and say it and be awarded with a detention or even a suspension. Personally, I don't want my child receiving a detention or suspension. Censorship is a growing issue in the United States. It can do good things like hide actual sexual interactions from children, which should be hid from children anyways. Censorship can also do the bad things like I discussed earlier, which do more harm on a child than good. When you're asked for your opinion on censorship, just always remember what's best for your child, and knowledge is always better than being clueless in a complex world.
1399	4376	2	3	Going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things and gain knowledge. Some items are not appropriate for everyone though. Certain books, movies, magazines, and music should not be accessed by everyone due to their mature content. Having an adult only section would be a practical way to solve this problem effectively. Removing certain materials from the library entirely would not be in the public's good interest. Any popular material should be available at the library for those who wish to access it. Many best selling books would be wrong for children to read, but they would be perfectly fine for adults. That doesn't mean these books need to be taken out of the library completely. Children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though. Having a designated section in the library from which only adults can rent the items would remove this problem. People under eighteen should also be restrained from looking through these materials to ensure their appropriateness. Having a children's section in the library would also keep them away from adult materials and provide a safe space for younger readers. The library needs to make itself user friendly for all age groups. People who frequent the library often pick up a book, not knowing what it holds inside. When inappropriate material is inside, a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to encounter. Parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text during a visit. They should feel safe letting their children look through all the books in the children's area. Library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults by monitoring the sections. Allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library's mission. Taking adult materials out of the library is not a good idea as it would lower its popularity and utility. Everyone has different interests, and they want to research them at the library freely. The safety of children is also important and must be considered. Making sure children cannot reach these materials is a primary concern for the institution. Having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem neatly. Not allowing anyone under eighteen to check out explicit materials would also help maintain a safe environment. Keeping the library full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation that we should all strive to achieve.
1400	4377	2	3	I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should be restricted for valid reasons. For example, there are many good books that are banned because they might have a little bit of cussing in them but I believe that is ok; I mean it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words, maybe even worse, if he turned on his television. But if a book talks about certain harmful things it should be banned, such as promoting hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someone's religion. For example, I read a very famous book called The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my school district so I couldn't check it out from the school library. I had to go to the public library to get it. I don't understand what is so wrong with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn that it is banned by the school board. This book does talk of a mischievous youngster who runs away, does a lot of different crazy activities, and even smokes but this is no worse than what we are exposed to on television and in other media. If I was an administrator in a school, I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express to the reader. For example, if a book is offensive to someone, for instance a book written by a hate group leader, this piece shouldn't be allowed on the shelf. But if it is a book about the Civil War and the South's view on slavery, this would be ok for educational purposes. Because the hate group book is more about spreading hate than anything else, it is for instance promoting discrimination and that isn't right. But the book on the Civil War and the South's view on slavery is a part of our history; it shows different ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong, it is just what they believed historically. So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that you shouldn't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it may not be what you agree with, but you should judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express. Hopefully you will agree with me in this perspective. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someone's religion, as these promote real harm. I have expressed my opinion on this matter; I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the school that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves, ensuring our decisions are guided by the content's overall message and educational value rather than isolated elements.
1401	4378	2	3	Wherever you go these days you see violence in every store around the world. Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output. A lot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there. I think that the offensive things should be taken off the shelves and sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores where it allows young teenagers to buy those products, then we are just putting ourselves at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and I saw magazines that were not appropriate. I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines. Music, movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store; that's why it's called a book store. It's not called a movie, music, or magazine store; they call it a book store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive, they are going to grow up thinking it's okay to be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store, just take the offensive ones and have a twenty-one or older sign. So the kids don't end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't. When I was young I went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. A lot of the time my mom would take the book from me because it was offensive; I didn't know that at the time, I was just a little kid. In today's society, kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and that's not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books. I guess it doesn't really matter for middle school and high school kids because those kids really don't like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for are the ones in elementary school because those kids actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelf, those kids will read it. And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what effect that drug has on you. In the end, it doesn't really matter what I say because people are going to keep making books. Any type of book is all based on how much money they can make. It doesn't matter if it is a negative or a positive book; the company wants to make money and so does the author. Ultimately, the cycle of producing potentially harmful content for profit will continue, regardless of the impact on young minds.
1402	4379	2	3	There are many different topics that could be offensive; it just depends on the person's own personal judgement. In my opinion, I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinions. If someone comes from a different country or even a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way. When I am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inappropriate topics for younger children be available in books like that. It is a little bit different with a high school student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think it is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone. In the book, 'A Child Called It', there is a lot of detailed events that happen. Some might say it is too graphic for children but the reality of it is, events like those happen in today's society. It really opened up my eyes and I am extremely happy I read it. The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe it had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation. Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying it is alright, but books that will help expand the children's minds. It could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitive topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? It would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs than having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in. I have also read a book recently titled, 'Unwind', it is about the government granting the ability to unwind your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. It is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. It states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing. It shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views. Racism, abortion, child abuse, unwinding your children, whatever the case may be, some people will support it and some will not. I think it is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truly believe in and taking 'offensive' material from school libraries is not going to help any. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about a topic, the author had to have had a reason to write it and honestly, what is better for the future than a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs.
1403	4380	2	3	Since the beginning there has always been someone who is offended by certain media. Books, movies, and music have been the main focus of the subject of this controversy. There have been arguments over it so severe that it has went to court! The people that have been upset over media have caused there to be certain censorships over these materials. I believe that there should not be censorship in media. I think that there are books, movies, and other media materials that can be found offensive to someone or a group of people. This is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it. If something is considered too vulgar for the public eye then they should have it somewhere more discreet, but not be taken off the shelves. I disagree that media materials should be taken off shelves for being offensive. Media is all about someone's free expression and trying to share it with the world. There are around seven billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do. A great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the bible. The bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print. People of different religions can sometimes find the print of bibles over their religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it. All these movies and books though are great because they are different and free! The world needs people who challenge ideas and religions. Every single person in the world is unique and I think it is great for everyone to put their opinions out for others to find so they can have a new view on the subject or at least contemplate it. Society has already put parental advisory warnings on cds, put ratings on movies, and labeled books as challenged. All this does is restrict the public from finding new ideas to compare to and form opinions. I believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have; it is what sets us apart from each other. Let media be free so men, women, and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful! Censorship will be challenged in years to come and I will help challenge it for all to be free and happy, embracing the diversity of thought that defines our humanity.
1404	4381	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines that are in libraries should be appropriate material. But in some cases it's fine to have some offensive literature because people can learn from it. But there needs to be an age limit to checking these items out. So I do believe we should keep offensive literature on the shelf. There needs to be a certain extent to what we leave on the shelves. Books, books, and more books; there are so many books and many other kinds of literature in libraries today. Libraries are a place of silence, and to some people that's boring. So like me, when I go into a library I go to the books or magazines that seem very interesting to me. Although they may seem interesting to me, others may find them offensive. Like it might be a comic book that might say something that someone might take offense to. Libraries can't please everyone that walks through the doors. Just because someone does not like the offensive stuff that's in there doesn't mean they have to take it out. Because there might be someone like me that likes those kind of books or magazines. There is offensive stuff all over the world so you can't avoid it everywhere you go. I believe there is a good outcome for keeping offensive literature material on the shelves. I think that keeping offensive material in libraries may have a good cause to it for one very good reason: learning. Like I said before, it may be offensive to some people but to some it's not. So some people might like to learn about offensive things. They may never know those things that are in those books. They may also never know what's in those books unless they keep them on the shelves. They need to have a section where offensive books, magazines, music and movies go. If something is offensive, put it on the shelf, and you must be eighteen years old to check it out if it's on that shelf. Yeah, there may be a down fall to keeping offensive things in libraries. But you can't hide from it all your life. So instead of going out into the world and learning about it the hard way, go to the library. You could pick a book up, learn about it and how to deal with it. It's just part of life; there is offensive material everywhere. You can't be sheltered your whole life. So in my greatest opinion, I do believe that we should keep these offensive materials in libraries, as it could be a learning experience that prepares one for the realities of the world.
1405	4382	2	3	I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books. However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries because they will separate us by washing away some bad things and that will be a bad idea. Removing books limits the availability of diverse ideas and prevents older, more mature readers from accessing important materials. It is better to have a system where access is managed, such as placing certain books in a restricted section for older patrons, rather than eliminating them entirely. This approach protects young children while still preserving the full range of literature for the community. Ultimately, censorship is not the solution, as it hinders intellectual freedom and the ability to learn from a wide array of perspectives, which is a fundamental value of any library.
1406	4383	2	3	I believe that censorship in libraries should definitely be relevant. Such as, I think that if someone wants to check out an adult book, they should be required to show an ID at the desk. Many children take advantage of the current system; they rent books and games they know their parents would never allow. A censorship system should be a quite simple arrangement for the public library systems to implement. Private libraries can do as they choose since they are not under any state law. On the other hand, public libraries are under state and city law, and they should not be able to show adult things to children. For example, in many libraries around the U.S., there are all books called manga or anime books; a lot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated 13+. I think there could be many changes in the library systems to address this, and it is your choice if you want to change them or not, but implementing these safeguards is a necessary step for protecting young patrons.
1407	4384	2	3	I do not believe that materials in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what their children are doing. If parents monitor their children closer, they will be able to control what they are accessing. There are a lot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen to out there, which is precisely why parental guidance is so crucial. Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen to. It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are actively looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library, the more profound books and magazines are separated from the children's books, which provides a natural division. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times I have been to a library, I have never accidentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages; it should not be limited to just one age group. If libraries were censored, more people would be upset. It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it. A lot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. The library would then become a place for mostly children. Most small children do not even go to the library by themselves, so they would become virtually useless for many community members. In all of my years, I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Whether it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouth, I have never seen a serious complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitoring what their children look at or read. Those responsible parents should not be deprived of their privileges to look at more adult-rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was too irresponsible to monitor their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished. The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefore, the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottom line is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things, they should keep a better watch over them and also teach them the difference between what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.
1408	4385	2	3	Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them and finds them offensive is simply not fair. A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy, and removing titles undermines this principle. A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think. Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the book's content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves. Take an author like Stephen King for example. His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people. That being said, censoring the book's language wouldn't help in the slightest; if a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like that, then they would have no problem making inferences on what material was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized regardless. The other fact is that taking out mature level books completely from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product, you're going to lose the diversity in your customers as well. For instance, think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were G and PG, there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because you're taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie. So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books? Books that deal with more controversial content shouldn't be placed on the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book may contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you can't blindfold them forever. We're all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality, so a rating system is a more practical approach.
1409	4386	2	3	I believe that if you let people take stuff off of the shelves that they didn't like, then there would be nothing left. I think this because there are a lot of parents that don't want their little kids to be seeing it or hearing it. That is because they could get influenced to do the wrong thing and get themselves in trouble for it. Then you have some parents that don't care what their kids are doing as long as they are leaving them alone, and then you have some others that are very overprotective. Yes, I think that there are some things that should be taken off shelves because they are very inappropriate. They are because they are talking about drugs and alcohol and trying to get young kids to try it and get addicted to it. That is why they can get more money from it, and those kids end up getting hurt or dying from it. All some of these businesses are trying to do is get money from the young because they make the bottles or containers look cool. Most of the time you will have kids go for it, but there are some kids that don't because they don't want to get in trouble or hurt themselves. There are some songs that should not be allowed to be played because of some of the stuff that they say. There are some people and some parents that listen to it with their kids in the car; then their kid will go to school and be singing it and get in trouble for it. I think that there are a lot of things that should be different, but they are not because the businesses are just happy that they are getting money. They don't care who is buying it as long as they get their money for it, and that is not the right way to look at it; you should care about the lives of people and their families. Then you have some magazines that have some inappropriate pictures in them. They do this because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one picture that is in it. They want it because it's a very pretty girl with just a bathing suit on or maybe nothing on. That is why they put it in there so they can get their money off of it. Most of the girls that are in them are models and they are very pretty, but sometimes there will be a little boy that takes his dad's magazine and then he takes it to school and gets in trouble for it. Then his parents are embarrassed because they didn't know that he had it. That is why I think that some stuff should not be on the shelves in stores. You will have parents that get it and then leave it laying out and their kids will get into it and might take it to school. You should never leave anything that you don't want your kids to have laying out for them to get, but some items also warrant greater responsibility from retailers.
1410	4387	2	3	Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offensive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I believe they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have different types they like, so removing content displeases many. Companies that manufacture books, movies, music, and magazines would be losing out on money if people can't find something they like. And if they don't have the money to make whatever it is they make, then they will go out of business. Then you might be out of luck for what you are looking for in the future. All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shelves because it offended some people? Well, that's how they feel when that happens to them with media. What would be put in their places? Stores have to have something to fill the shelves. Would they put more candy to make the world fat, or just less variety? If you come across something you think is offensive, just don't pay attention to it. Others may like it just like you like your favorite candy. We have a great number of other things you can pick from, so there is no need to remove options for everyone else.
1411	4388	2	3	A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read, her eyes wide with anticipation. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. Disappointed, the child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book, her search equally frustrated. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it. Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it. By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself, to share thoughts and ideas. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me. Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas. Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it. In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to, allowing for personal choice and continued learning.
1412	4389	2	3	I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable, showing how subjective offense truly is. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive, containing powerful ideas that challenge us. Some books are racist; Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's, losing vital historical context. Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it! When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse, adding a layer of intrigue. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that, discovering new perspectives. Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge. Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries, a belief in the fundamental right to choose what we read.
1413	4390	2	3	I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelfs because a few people are offended. There @MONTH1 be a few that don't like something but for every few that don't like it there are some who do, and their access matters too. For example there might be a book that makes females look dumb but personally it doesn't affect me but there are some girls who get offended because thier superior knowledge. I have a friend who gets offended by movies that the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first. So if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left, a very small selection. I feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves. Even though I feel offended I'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give tips and actually helps people feel better about themselves and if I took that away from them it could cause issues for those who benefit. If there is something that is removed from shelves it should have a good reason, a truly compelling one. Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it.Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue. Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other. Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued, which is a practical concern. Yes I agree that there are some people who would request the stuff to be removed but you can't always get your way. I know people would say thats not fair but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair' and thats true. So next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this principle. So in conclusion things shouldn't be removed unless nessecary. So when someone is offended thats their problem. You can always walk away you dont have to look or listen, and that is the simplest solution of all.
1414	4391	2	3	I believe that the certain materials such as books,music,movies, magazines, ect. they are here for a reason. People like them. Maybe there are some books and things that people @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not find offensive. Thats ok I'm not try to say it isn't, but you don't have to look at that book. There are so many others to pick from it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up, the choice is yours. The objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles. People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers,but through these tools. Tools is a better word for these things. It makes them have a meaning, a purpose beyond simple amusement. Children now day love books, music,movies, magazines,ect. As a teenager I can say that most of us who like music we love it. It builds our charater, helping to shape who we are. People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust. They were ment to be picked up and look at, to be experienced. I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this. Don't get me wrong I can understand were their opinon stands,but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Children,@CAPS1,and @CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another. Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well, limiting our resources. If people want this is going to be a big war. Only because they are not the only people on the planet. People want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin, a slippery slope. Next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then, something else. Its just one right after another it won't stop. This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion some are good and some are bad. In this case, my opinion I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can inprove our world as we know it to be, for they are essential for growth and understanding.
1415	4392	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. Do you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books. Reading @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well, making your own choices. Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on. Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away from everyone else. Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs, a serious consequence. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work that have stood the test of time. I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do, providing a valuable lesson. I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives; you cannot hide from the world. Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check. Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say about learning from negative examples. If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me and many others. This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come? You must learn to deal with @CAPS4, it is a part of life. Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing and expression. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie,
1416	4393	2	3	In this world you never know what someone might be writing. There are many materials in this world that I think aren't appropriate for someone to be reading, watching, or listening to, etc. You might be thinking that anyone makes his or her own decision about what they read, watch, or listen to. Well, I do agree with that, but I do believe that some materials aren't rated properly for age. I do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone. You might be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, etc., but in my opinion some materials are just offensive and not proper. I have seen so many materials that I think are not proper for people under age to be looking at. In some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or bad language. You might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but I do. In my opinion, some materials are rated too low, and should not be for people under age. It's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and or acting like rebels to their parents. Many of these things kids get from books, music, movies, etc. This is one of the many reasons some materials should be banned from kids. You ask yourself why? Well, first of all, kids are just learning and they do everything they watch, see, or listen to. I mean now kids don't even think about what they are about to do. They just do it, they don't care, they think it's okay. I think that parents should be alert to offensive materials on the shelves, and should say something about it so they get banned. Why ban some materials from everyone? Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right? You might be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and nothing wrong with it. Well, you might be right but also wrong. I certainly do agree with you, we all watch things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us. Why do people do crazy things now in these days? In my opinion, I think it is because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, etc. I think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what. It's the right thing to do. If you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is, well, we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and ban them for good. We certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or acting like rebels to us. We don't want some crazy person coming to our house and doing crazy things to us just because that's what they learned from those materials they had on the shelves. It has come to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone for the safety and betterment of our society.
1417	4394	2	3	A place full of knowledge should be a place where you can find all the news that is making the world what it is today; a person should be able to find out things from the past also. A library has many different things found in it: books, magazines, movies, and some have music. The books range from encyclopedias to classic novels, the variety of books and information is to the extreme. But then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information. With all the profanity found in today's society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library. Books are put into a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgeable. The thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting but then again who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature types of information or language found in them. I feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read; the fact of the matter is they have the right to. Both, young and older people need to be educated in the world's past history and the present news. One reason being to prevent things that happened in the past from happening again. Another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is informed. Libraries should have banners or flaps up saying what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go over to those areas or not. Things that are found 'not right' in one's eyes might not seem so bad to another's; it's all in personal preference. Things should still be out for the public to read or see. Making the choice to go into a library is an individual's decision. The fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to get knowledge, no matter what type of information. A person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others, as access to diverse ideas is fundamental to a free society.
1418	4395	2	3	I think that your parents should have to sign a piece of paper saying that it is ok or it's not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way their kids will handle it. On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience; no pornographic material of course, but stuff that wouldn't be considered suitable for young children. Kids fifteen and older would understand the content better. They might also have to have an adult with them for access. On the other side of the library it would be more of a children's area with child stories. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger and would contain age-appropriate content they would like. There would have to be someone at the dividing line checking the pass that says it's ok or not. It would be a little difficult to manage but it would satisfy both parties involved. It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for their children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least a certain age in order to get a pass from the parent though, to ensure some level of maturity. I definitely agree with Katherine Paterson that eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me about it than find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law, or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them, which makes guided access a sensible solution.
1419	4396	2	3	Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle? Everyone in this world is entitled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people might be right to others. For example, one family might view their children using curse words as offensive while another might see no problem with it. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence discussed in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear. It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that reality. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability to see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspectives does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the acknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were once censored from him. In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin, but when it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion, not an objective truth that justifies widespread censorship.
1420	4397	2	3	Do I think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves? No, I do not think that some of these materials should be removed. Why? Because nowadays kids read things such as gang violence and things that don't involve school material, but some kids find the books that they read interesting. Now, do I think that the books should be not given to students who are very young of age? Yes, due to the fact that some books are a little above others' age of reading and comprehension. Sometimes you might have kids who are interested in what others don't read. Books such as those about gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some can't read. I think that in this case kids under a certain age shouldn't read these books because of some of the content that is involved in it. Kids find these books, movies, and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books. I'm not saying that it's a good thing, but I'm saying that the things they read and see in those books and movies are things that some of us have seen in everyday life. When I was younger, I went to a library in my hometown, and whenever a kid would choose a book that wasn't for him or her they would always say 'you need your parents permission to check this book or magazine etc. out'. Once I actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this I thought that it was a good idea. I figure that all libraries should be like this considering that kids shouldn't read books that aren't for them. This is also a good way to get kids from reading things that are not age appropriate to finding something that is suitable for their level. So the main answer to this suggestion is, no, I don't think that these materials should be moved from shelves out of libraries. Why? Because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone. So my suggestion is to not move them and let them stay on shelves just as any other book would, maintaining access while encouraging parental guidance.
1421	4398	2	3	Do you believe that certain books, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship? There are many times when you hear a parent tell their child not to look at that magazine because they don't want them to see the vulgar things on the inside. I've heard parents tell their children not to ever watch that movie because it'll show things that they don't need to be seeing. Almost every day we're put in situations like these, not knowing whether we should pick up the magazine or just leave it on the shelf. In my opinion, I believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves. Kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves. Kids are told many times a week by their parents, teachers, and other adults to go the library. They can work on their homework, read a book, or do some studying for school. When they get distracted from finding the book they want with a book that has vulgar things in it, they're going to be curious. The main reason I disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children. The last thing they need to be looking at is something that isn't appropriate for their age. It's hard for a child to turn down a movie or magazine they've never seen or looked at before. In most libraries the adult section is seperated from the childrens section. This doesn't mean that a child can't over hear something that the adults are listening to or watching. The childrens section is made for fairytale stories and kid movies, but when the adult section has things going on over there that aren't the most appropriate then kids can over hear. If children and adults are going to be in the same library then I think they should make it completely impossible for children to veer over there and see what's new on that side of the library, perhaps by installing a physical barrier or a monitored checkpoint. Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of teenages in the community. After school hours, a lot of teenagers in our community enjoy going to the library. If this is such a good environment for teenagers to be then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet? Some teenagers listen to bad music with cursing, vulgar language, and much more. Libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this. If they want to download bad music then they need to do it somewhere else where youngers can't get ahold of any of it. My last argument for this is a heads up for the parents. Parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library. You might not think your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes, they're curious. All children are and it's human nature to be curious. I, myself, would go with my child a few times just to see what's in the library and tell them not to take things off the shelves that look bad. Some libraries can't completely fix everything. They can't take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves. In the quote it says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.', I can think of books and magazines that I would never want any child to look at, especially at a young age. Libraries need to be more interested in taking vulgar things off the shelves so that younger children cannot get ahold of them. It's one thing for a child to see a book or magazine that isn't necessarily appropriate, but in a library it's a completely different story and the responsibility ultimately falls on the institution to protect its youngest visitors.
1422	4399	2	3	There are certain books that no child should ever read but in some libraries they don't care whats on there shelf. They don't care if a little kid starts reading a book full of cusswords and other profanity. As long as hes reading thats all that matters to them. Even though in libraries there are kid sections that doesn't mean he can't walk over and grab an adult book or what ever he can get his hands on. When I was little I was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language. We even thought it was funny when ever the book had cursewords in it cause we would just repeat them out loud. I remember in school even books the teacher would read to us had cursewords and we would all laugh at it, even the teacher thought it was funny. But if we ever repeated that word while not reading it we would get sent down to the office. Even though we thought it was ok to say just because we read it out of a book, we learned that context matters. I do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it. I think its fine to have cursewords in books when there in junior high but elementary school is to early. Those books are meant for adults only cause some books sound better with cursewords in them, adding a sense of realism or raw emotion. My parents thought it was wrong when I would bring home a book from the library and it would be full of cursewords or slang. But they would never say anything to the library cause they know that I will be hearing these words all the time when I get older. Those are all the reasons why I think books with curse words should not be handed out to little kids and should be kept in a separate, restricted area.
1423	4400	2	3	Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. Every reader seeks out a different style. Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all sorts of people. For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an adult only cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical and limits the diversity of available thought. Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options. To each, its own, and the freedom to choose what to read should remain with the individual and their family.
1424	4401	2	3	Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have opaque covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at. When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, The Undertaker could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch The Undertaker compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the television and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians. I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, 'South Park'. South Park is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their friends. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with South Park show was that my dad loved South Park show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me. I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Metallica, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named Guns N' Roses. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary for a child's development. Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust and limits intellectual freedom.
1425	4402	2	3	Yes there are many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out. I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,magazines,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment. If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be eighteen or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be eighteen. Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying eighteen and older. So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people who object to the content.
1426	4403	2	3	What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantrum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves. Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely necessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books left! For example, I would not want my little brother reading certain books because some chapters contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand such mature content. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it or learn from its story.  If you were to get books removed that were about science because you were religious, many students wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different. The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win in a public forum.  I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest, starting a dangerous precedent. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information contained within its pages. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf for the benefit of the entire community.
1427	4404	2	3	Tough times for a little citizen. Censorship is a problem we are faced with today. I believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary, but I also feel it must be kept in check. That's why I have a great deal of respect for organizations and industries that try and stop or put off censorship of media until you are more mature and responsible enough to handle it. The most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are books and music. A lot of books are very well written and fabulous to read, but in history or racial, and more cultural books they use words and terms that are offensive to me and a lot of other people too.  Also, the main cause in this is music. In today's society, nearly every person has an iPod and downloaded onto that iPod is music. I'm not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases I hear about every word in the book and race topics. Rappers are setting bad examples for young adolescents like myself, who pose with guns and have marijuana and crack. Why do they do this? Just to make themselves more popular. That is hurting our education and making us think we should be criminals, which is a dangerous path to follow. I in my opinion enjoy magazines and true informative facts from professional reporters. The reporters are on the citizens side and trying to get the true facts out there for us the people. Magazines also tell about annual celebrations and good things happening in the world, where you can find out the scores of sports games and what the weather is going to be like.  Last year, I remember reading a classic novel in class. It was so controversial and talked about black slaves and whites treating them like dirt. Also, about blacks never winning a trial and being treated unfairly. I felt embarrassed and I was the only African American in the class. It was awkward. I felt like if we had a discussion people would talk badly about it then remember I was in the room then they'd stop, which made the situation even more uncomfortable. What is the world going to do? Censorship covers an entire multi-media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship. It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolescents in the world. To help fight this cause! Bring down all that is bad! We can do it, we will fight! Like a great leader says, 'don't hope for a better change or wish for a new world.' If you want change you need to make it happen and stand up for what's right and make a difference in the world for everyone.
1428	4405	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend one's gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offends one's religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offends one's race. The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy and demeaned. Second, the material can cause a large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others who join the dispute. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text, which could be psychologically damaging.  Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director, fostering unnecessary division. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not about offending someone's religion or their deeply held beliefs. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrorists from this offensive content, which is a severe but possible consequence.  The material also should be removed if it is offending someone's race. First, the material might call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's a very offensive name, even if not directly but in general. Second the material can speak of the race as if it was bad or inferior in some way. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race, perpetuating harmful stereotypes from a young age. The material that is offensive to anyone's gender, religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. The library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting and not to offend other people in all ways, making it a safe space for all.
1429	4406	2	3	Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is inappropriate for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should not be permitted in the public library. To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child may not be aware of these distinctions. I believe there are certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older and more mature.  To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation within the community. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back and form a negative opinion. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religious topics. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in, leading to potential conflict. This could result in a huge confrontation between library patrons and staff.  Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic, which can be inherently divisive. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying, feeling attacked. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something, making such materials a source of constant friction. To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what might cause problems to certain people in our community. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be considered 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library where anyone can access them. We could easily solve this problem by making a separate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it and the library can remain a welcoming environment for all.
1430	4407	2	3	What do you think about them taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive? Everyone has a different look on it. It is an important thing to think about for the community. Just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around? Many would say no, because they are too young to know about stuff that shows too much and for other reasons also. Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens, and children who frequent these public spaces. I believe that they should be taking off the shelves, and you have to be eighteen or older to buy them for many reasons. The biggest reason I think they should is, kids under the age of eighteen want to look cool like the older teenagers, but really don't need to see that kind of mature content. With the young teenager thinking they need to do things like the stuff in music and movies to be cool and thinking if they do that they will look cool, it creates a harmful cycle. Young teenagers don't think about what they are doing, and just think it is ok because the older ones are doing it and they see it portrayed in media. With magazines, movies, and music they need to be of age to buy, which is a sensible restriction.  One big reason to believe that they should be taking off the shelves is because a lot of kids and young teens think they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive without any barriers. There are a lot of different types of offensive media, and you have to be of age to go into some places that sell them, but libraries are open to all. By believing that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the parent a carefree feeling about your child being able to look at things without thinking about the offensive ones that could be encountered. I hope with reading my persuasive essay, I hope I relate to someone about the books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive and you can realize what I'm talking about with young teens around the ages of thirteen to seventeen. Think about if you take your child with you and they see something like that in a public library. With the ideas I gave you it helps you see the outlook on stuff that is offensive on the shelves and why their removal is a necessary step for protecting our youth.
1431	4408	2	3	Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day. In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. may offend any race or a certain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the nation. Some may be very offensive but it only shows a past, others may just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the real history are an education source so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speech away. I hate when I hear music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family might have been. It serves as a record, a testament to the times, both good and bad. In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something today might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because a lot of offence today has resulted from the past.
1432	4409	2	3	Censorship in libraries? A yes or a No? I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in our communities. I dont see who would come up with such an absurd idea. To me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended. Sometimes I remind you that we almost changed our pledge to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people dont believe in god. Now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?! Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I dont think this book is appropriate for my child.' What about the people that do like that book and now wont be able to read it anymore all because of that one person? There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eighteen year or older section so younger kids dont see them. The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to children make libraries sound like there pornographic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause their child to be mentally scarred forever. Hell there are really that many books out there anyways. Now sometimes a bad book might end up in the kids section but that does not mean we have to remove that book forever from all the other people who want to read that book. All library workers just have to make sure to put all books in their rightful spots and nothing bad will happen. The bad books will be in the adult section and the child friendly books will be in another. Have some library workers watching the area and make sure little kids dont go in the adult library. This will prevent children from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section. In conclusion I answer this question by saying no. There are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever.
1433	4410	2	3	I believe that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive. If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves. Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world might not teach them. If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote. If certain literature were not around anymore then it definitely would not be the same as it is now. Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if one book was taken away, it would start a riot. Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality. Imagine if you were not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society. If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything. Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society. Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.' Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart. Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking? Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers. They have problems just like people of the real world even though they might not be real themselves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about their problem. Important history books or movies could be taken away because it 'offends' a group to have students learn about slaves. If one item was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away from society. What good does that do anyone? It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about. It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of appropriateness. If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now. No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries. Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down. If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries. They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the country and maybe even across the globe. Information of any kind is a good thing no matter the content of it. So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea.
1434	4411	2	3	The content in todays materials are not always suitable for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent environment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuance of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society. In video games there are ratings that help explain what is suitable for each age throughout childhood and adolescence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be allowed to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unnecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being. The reason ratings should be changed is because children absorb their environment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary. Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by putting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, etc. teens are now becoming accustomed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor conducive for children. By censoring certain material it disallows the continuance of bad behavior amongst our youth today.
1435	4412	2	3	READ WITH CAUTION I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibility to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find may not coincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up. Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting 'Fifty Shades of Grey' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' into the adults section. In addition, author Judy Blume once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read, the knowledge contained within them unknown. There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as promiscuous reading material, keeps children from formulating ideas about concepts they may not be able to fully understand. With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.
1436	4413	2	3	A library is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent. As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the library to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad or inappropriate for their age. A few years back, I heard about a teenage boy that would go into the library about once a week to look for movies that his parents would not approve of. Later on that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not have had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the library. This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue. I strongly believe that library material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. From what I have seen, someone might want, for example, a book about Christianity taken off the shelf because they are Jewish and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion. Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the library for hours and soak in a good novel. Material that is found offensive does not belong there, unless it is for real educational learning, and its presence undermines the library's role as a safe haven for learning and discovery.
1437	4414	2	3	The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inappropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I. I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adult themes. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age. These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times. When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called 'The Book Thief' by Markus Zusak. This book was a fictional story taking place during the Second World War. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out. That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it. From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over eighteen, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it may be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc. In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion. Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imperative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is.
1438	4415	2	3	Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people. There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves. I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves. One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project. For example, a student could have a project over evolution. A book on evolution could offend many people. Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book. Someone might need a certain book for a project. If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class. That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves. Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves is that it's their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it. Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people? There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it for enjoyment or for their own educational purposes. If a book offends you just don't look at it. Why would you look at something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries would have to remove a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it. That is my last reason my opinion is what it is. So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in taking books off the shelves. People need them for research and projects. It is someone's opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them. For example, if I didn't like something on a menu at a restaurant they are not going to take it off the menu for me. My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them; that would be easier than taking books off the shelves and restricting access for everyone else.
1439	4416	2	3	Is censorship right to have in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people might want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that might like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic. In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are public areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe it is unjustified to take away censorship in libraries because this might be one's favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while no one else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are too revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American Eagle is not going to ban capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions. A great resolution for this disagreement is categorizing. By putting all of the censored books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, it will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Whereas the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around that section. This is a quick and easy fix. There is no reason to take away one's favorite genre because someone doesn't like it. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue Aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend Sarah likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbeneficial for either of us because now the one we do not like is gone but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. People in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make it fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Categorizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediately to satisfy the diverse needs of all library patrons.
1440	4417	2	3	In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many parents are opposed to. While libraries may seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrays it to be. One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the parents to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' Parents should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library. A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a separate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an R-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of M, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. This same censorship should be applied to libraries. Having separate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a separate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. This type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of this would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the R-rated movie, if his parents deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. This gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. This same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library. Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' This is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become this way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all too well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. This ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that this is acceptable?
1441	4418	2	3	Library books offensive? The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us, the general public, per our individual opinions. If someone has an issue with a particular book; next time, simply do not check it out. I know that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the libraries. It's not up to us to make that choice for the entire community. I know people sometimes find something wrong or inappropriate in a book at the libraries', but if it wasn't to your liking, don't read the rest of it or recommend it to a friend. I have had personal problems with this before. I went to check out a book and my mom said that she didn't like the topic that it was about: honestly, its her opinion. A person should have a right to his or her opinions but it shouldn't affect someone else's access to information. One person might really like the book and someone else might hate it, obviously there are people out there who enjoy that type of book so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it entirely. The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian. That professional knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library's collection. If a book includes something graphic or racist, you can talk to them about it in a calm conversation, because they may be a librarian but they don't read every single book that is in the library. Some items can be offensive to some but not others. The library is there for knowledge and entertainment. We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal because there could be reasons why things are where they are. You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter and who is in charge of the library, trusting their professional judgment for the benefit of all patrons.
1442	4419	2	3	To whom it may concern, Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As Americans, we have certain rights that we are guaranteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what literature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today. In the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, we are given certain freedoms. Some of these rights, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been constricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We may not have 'lost' these freedoms, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat? Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples on why censorship of written literature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writing a research paper about the psychological effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of its country's youth. Some American classics are also being speculated against. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies. But because time has changed its meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an American classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'. Censorship is not only taking place in written literature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers. Music is one of the biggest parts of our society today. With the invention of iPods and similar devices, music has become much more common, and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it may seem offensive to some citizens, but others may just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you may not listen to that,'? This should not be allowed, yet it is. How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the rights of our great country's citizens, and the freedoms of individuals like yourself. Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen.
1443	4420	2	3	It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that may be harmful to children, freedom of information is far more important than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors. The First Amendment states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the First Amendment grants freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be available to them if not for censorship. Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor. Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' Without a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Indeed this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knowledge left. Without knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark. Many books are banned that address great problems of society. Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman Guy Montag burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend their special interest, that is censorship. They feel powerful when they restrict other people's freedoms. A novel by Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five, was banned. Apart from vulgar language in the book, Slaughterhouse-Five also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of Dresden in World War Two. This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned. How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned? Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatantly unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our intelligence and liberty, for it ultimately stifles the very progress it claims to protect against.
1444	4421	2	3	Children are our future because when I am old they will be the ones who are caring for me, so for me censorship is a big deal. It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an important issue but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries. My view on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf. I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of public libraries makes it hard to choose where to draw the line. You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I do believe that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book for their own education and enjoyment. I think there are some books that should stay out of the library though. An example is books that are extremely racist. These books should be kept far away from our children. This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things without understanding the context. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet. There are things that you can do as an alternative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one method that is used in public libraries and it is separating the adult books from the children books. You could also move these two sections to opposite sides of the library. The books that are more explicit could be put higher up such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as an adult, providing a simple physical barrier. These are my views and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and views that I have are most likely different than most people. I thought that they were good ideas though, ones such as separate section for kids and adults. I thought my best one was putting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther apart, which seems like a practical compromise between access and protection.
1445	4422	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to express the way we feel or think, but can it be too graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries is needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others. Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that involve a great deal of violence. Childrens minds are like sponges, which means they soak up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning in everyday activities, potentially leading them to mimic what they have encountered. If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is often someone like Eminem. Eminem has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by Eminem and in every song one of those four key topics comes up, reinforcing these themes repeatedly. Like Eminem the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like 'The Hangover', 'Superbad', 'Project X' etc. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on spring or summer break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them, as they might not distinguish between on-screen antics and real-life consequences. Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to express ourselves but we also have the responsibility to consider limiting it if we feel it is endangering the minds of others. I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess, ensuring a safer environment for vulnerable patrons while still upholding the core principle of access to information.
1446	4423	2	3	I think whatever is offensive should be taken off of the shelf because it is inappropriate. Books do not need to be like that because they are supposed to be fun for you and help you learn; yes, you can have a little violence in an action or adventure book to get the mood of the character, the setting of the story, and to understand it perhaps. Offensive books can be okay at times, so if you have a comedy magazine or a book that is making fun of something or someone, it can be taken in an offensive way, or just as a joke and in a non-offensive way. To most people, they are going to want to take those kinds of books off of the shelf. Offensive books to them, such as parents or maybe even friends, they can teach a child wrong, and that child might not learn the right way. Kids when they are little, their brains are like sponges, so they learn and remember stuff well at that age. A child getting a hold of a book or being taught something from a book like that will most likely remember it. I think those kinds of books should be taken off of the shelf because kids don't need to be reading that kind of stuff when it's already on television and talked about. They need the educational books that can teach them and prepare them for their upcoming higher grade levels, so then they would have a fresh start on new words or grammar, which is a more productive use of their time.
1447	4424	2	3	I think they should be taken off the shelves if they are too vulgar for young children, like if it has to deal with sex or violence they should be taken off shelves. They should only be allowed to put appropriate stuff on the shelves for a general audience. I think that they shouldn't even make books or magazines like that unless they can keep them hidden from people under a certain age. But people are gonna do what they want to do, and that is the reality of the situation. That is all I have to say on this matter, and I hope you have a nice day.
1448	4425	2	3	Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are too offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they should not be read. Time and time again throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do. Libraries should have the right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, and this is why. We, as people of the nation, have battled through hard times. Wars, racism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall. Having dealt with those issues we always tend to repeat them out of a lack of knowledge. Slavery and other historical conflicts were some of the nation's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome. Recalling those memories is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be censored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions. Pertaining to movies, music, and magazines the same law applies. Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form of expression and everyone has their own taste. Not having the option to choose from a variety of styles is wrong and unfair. Music can not only be an expression of feeling about love or anger but it can also teach life lessons. Some artists like to sing or rap about their life journey. This can educate others into knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad. In a magazine, they tend to lean towards more current topics such as politics, jobs, or young adult lifestyles. Movies apply to the same rights and topics. Each one is equally as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call. What gives a group of people the right to say this is inappropriate and that you should not read it? They do not have it. In the constitution, it states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose. By censoring what people read, that is in a way taking away that author's right to speak, which is unfair. Though Katherine Paterson made a valid point in saying that some books are too offensive to read, she just simply is not right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, or magazine of any genre and read it. If materials were censored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it. The bottom line is that you have free will and you have the power to choose whether or not you want to read something.
1449	4426	2	3	There are things in the world that are not meant for certain people to see. Things like rated R movies, mature books, alcohol, and explicit music are not meant for children. Yes, people have rights; they can view whatever they want. If a child wants to see a rated R movie or drink a beer, that is the parent's choice to let that child see that movie, not the person running the store. If you are under the age limit, a storekeeper should have the right to tell you that you can't go in the store or buy his product. Is it okay for a storekeeper to tell your child no? Some would say yes to this and others would say no. If your child is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your child to have this movie, you might be mad if a storekeeper let your child buy it. On the other hand, you might be mad if this storekeeper told your child he wasn't allowed to buy this movie. If the rating is based on maturity, how does this storekeeper know how mature your child really is? Your child could be one that likes to copy the things they see on movies; the storekeeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this child; he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing. How would this storekeeper feel if this child watched this movie he let the child buy and the child went out and killed someone? How would you feel if this happened? This wouldn't happen if there was a clear and enforced age limit. If a group of sixteen-year-olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking? Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving. When you're a teenager you don't think about what's going to happen after you make a choice; you just think about how fun it's going to be while you're doing it. Most young people aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spur of the moment. Therefore, there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like whether or not your child can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit on buying an R-rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives, etc., is necessary. What would the world be like if children went around with these things? With an age limit on certain things, there wouldn't be a problem with these dangerous situations.
1450	4427	2	3	What do you go to the library for? In earlier times, libraries used to be the place where you went to study. There were no computers, and so you had to go look up your work in an educational book at the library. Is that truly what people are doing at the libraries now, or are people there to look at vulgar books, magazines, and movies? A library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books. But now you can go to the library and be tempted to look at books you shouldn't be looking at. Instead, you could be on the computer the whole time playing games of some sort; the possibilities are endless. People now could go to the library and check out a magazine, movie, or book on pornography, drugs, alcohol, or worse. Is that really what you want your kid to accidentally pick up at the library? Personally, I myself witnessed a little kid pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mom had to grab it very fast before he had the chance to look at the magazine. The library should not be used for this, and the threat of young kids accidentally looking at these materials should not be happening in the library. The music someone could listen to is also very bad, and your child could listen to that. Then what if they want to keep listening to it? Yes, the world does have a huge impact on what is put into the library because drugs, sex, scandals, and alcohol seem to be what most teenagers are interested in at some point in their young life. But a library is a community building and there is no stopping someone from coming in and easily getting these vulgar things. The thoughts of the youth are completely swayed after they watch, read, or listen to this, and this needs to be controlled. Women and children can find all of these materials offensive. These materials need to be censored more than what they are right now. Libraries should be a safe place where people can go to study or get a book, and not to be tempted to look at something they should not be looking at. Many people find this offensive. Yes, in the end, libraries are a great place, but the people who do not use libraries for the right reasons are why these materials need to be censored at the libraries to protect the community's values.
1451	4428	2	3	A library card is one thing a kid always looked forward to, a small but significant milestone. It's the first piece of identification that many kids have that they are allowed to carry around themselves, a token of responsibility. The card opens up a whole new world of entertainment and stories that can take you anywhere you want to go, from magical kingdoms to distant galaxies. Once a kid owned a library card, they were allowed to check out any book they wanted out of the huge selection of items in a library. But how do you keep a young child from checking out a book, movie, or magazine about inappropriate adult material? A solution to this problem should be formed so that people can be protected from material they don't want to see in a book, movie, or any other source of entertainment. Libraries today normally have a specified children's section, where picture books and short stories litter the shelves. The rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre. The only way to understand what the item is about is to flip through the pages or read the back cover and try to find a hint of how the plot goes. This could be dangerous at times because not all materials give a specific summary of what happens, leaving the content a mystery until it's too late. I once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park. It ended up being scary for another reason, as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple minutes of the feature. I had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like that and I was disgusted that there was no warning. I believe items like that should be placed in a separate area or at least be required to give a summary of the kind of offensive material in them. Libraries could collect viewer comments, allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it, noting any surprising or mature content. People could then read these comments before checking out that item. Viewer comments would be a good way to get someone else's opinion on what the item contained before another decided to rent it. Another effective way to help this problem would be to give materials a certain rating, like the ratings of movies when they come out in theaters. A specific rating would warn viewers or readers from checking out an item that is offensive or inappropriate. Libraries could also give specific age ranges according to the ratings on an item, not allowing anyone under a certain age limit to check out a book from the building, similar to how movie theaters enforce age restrictions. Ratings would help keep offensive books out of a child's hands, or that of anyone else who didn't want to be exposed. Libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of. They can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items. I believe items with offensive material should be either put in a separate area, or given a certain rating in order to warn people before checking it out. Allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful. Libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures, so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material that can be easily avoided with these simple systems.
1452	4429	2	3	Do you find books you read offensive? How about music, or magazines? I sure don't. I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read for themselves. If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amount of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public and selected voluntarily. I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book. A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time. They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time, providing a realistic context. Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book just to put someone down. I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book, not to cause harm. Music on the other hand could be thought of as different. Many people could take music in the wrong way. A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap. Rappers tend to express themselves thoroughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language. I personally don't get bothered by the music, because they are usually referring to their own life and how things went with them, sharing a personal story. Music can also be on the good side too. When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax and unwind after a long day. Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to. Then you have magazines. Personally I think they are the worst of all. Magazines tend to go one way or the other. They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them. One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story behind the headlines. In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about. Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it, creating a mixed message. In these regards, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library's collection. There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side of offering choice. Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it. With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music, it is a simple matter of personal selection. Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy. There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way, but I don't believe there is anything wrong with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement to navigate the vast selection available.
1453	4430	2	3	Imagine your favorite book, song, and movie. The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read a million times over. The ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much. Now imagine it gone from the libraries. What happened to it? You think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do? When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selections of books and other materials to choose from. A library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in, fostering a love for learning and stories. This is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people. If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but one person's dislike should not dictate another's access. Libraries should accommodate as many people as they are able. Removing material from the shelves might make some people happy, but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable and meaningful. Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. Doing this could result in less material for people of all ages, shrinking the diversity of available knowledge. If you find something to be offensive, all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out; it is a simple act of personal choice. In Katherine Paterson's words, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that if items were to be removed from the shelves, there would be less for others to enjoy, creating an empty and limited collection. Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch, a story that brings them comfort or joy. If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only disable you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material, robbing them of the experience. Many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive. While some might think that some books have subjects too racy for readers, others may not feel that this is not the case at all. Take a popular childrens book like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. To some, this might be one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book. They would have never had the chance to make their own opinions and discover the magic within its pages. I feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion. It is only natural to disagree with someone. You can always run into people that don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies. Eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people who value those works. If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only reach out to a certain audience, defeating their purpose. Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste, offering something for every individual. To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people than it would solve. If an item that someone was looking forward to checking out was no longer available due to censorship, many people might even decide that they don't want to go to the library anymore, feeling that their interests are not valued. What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy freely. Censoring material would be like telling a reader that their opinions were not as important as those of the people who found it offensive. I believe that if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available to check out at the library, first think to yourself what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things. Because after all, what you think is offensive might be the best thing in the world to someone else, and a library should be a home for all those different worlds.
1454	4431	2	3	Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of. What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books? It is a common concern for many parents. My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it, a straightforward approach to personal preference. I think they should have a childrens section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem of mixing content. If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them to grant permission. That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that their parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read, placing the responsibility of guidance on the family. If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it; no one is forcing you to check it out. Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf, as their tastes may differ from yours. They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want their children to see it because their children would need their permission to check out the book anyways, making the system self-regulating. I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or their parents would not approve of, creating a harmonious environment for all.
1455	4432	2	3	Do I think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be removed from our librarys? No I dont think they should be removed, they could be placed in another part of the library away from all the other books that aren't offensive, providing a simple compromise. If they did decide to remove these books our kids would have a hard time learning about the truth and experiencing different perspectives. Book publishers put only what they want our kids to learn, often presenting a sanitized version of events. Most of the time they leave out bits and pieces about what really happened, obscuring the full picture. So if they took the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines out, a lot of kids would just go home everyday and sit around or cause trouble, missing out on stimulating material. From my own experience, I enjoyed reading, listening, and watching the offensive materials they want to take out of our librarys, as they often contained thought-provoking and honest content. So if you don't like the offensive materials then don't even look at them, that will solve your problem, and teach your children that too, promoting personal responsibility over broad restrictions. Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials. If people still complain, move it to another part of the library, in a separate room or somethin of that kind, so it is accessible but not in plain sight. This should solve the problem of kids reading, listening, and watching these kinds of things without having to remove them entirely for everyone.
1456	4433	2	3	Be a parent or responsible child if you are against censorship. Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue. If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it. Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies. It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly. One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good vocabulary that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best. Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if you do, supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from. The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my vocabulary from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'. With that being said dont avoid the inevitable.
1457	4434	2	3	I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect. I am actually reading the very controversial book 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. As you may know the author of this book is named Mark Twain. Another thing you may know is the use of the 'n-word'. This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the 'n-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in Mark Twain's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south. People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want.
1458	4435	2	3	I don't think that censorship in libraries is right, for many reasons. First reason is that all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone. Second reason is that what you might think is not appropiate, to someone it might not be. Last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on is book how he feels, without having to worry that his book might be taken off the shelves of public libraries. My first reason why I think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community. For example if a student needed to do research on how black slaves were treated back in history,he might not be able to find a book, to find information on it because someone thought books like that are offensive to black people, so in this case this student wouldn't be able to find any information on his topic, because of the censorship in his library, so instead of going to a library he will have to go somewhere else, where he might find the wrong type of information. Second reason is that what you might think is offensive, might not be to another person. So why should your point of view affect another person. It wouldn't be fair that a point of view of one person would limit the choices that a person has when he goes to the library. Censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive. My last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on his book how he wants, without having to worry that his book might get taken off the shelves of public libraries for its contents. Sometimes the content that books have is needed to make the book for discriptive, and interisting to the reader. Content that you might think is offensive, is the content that really helps the reader understand the book better. This are the reasons why i think that censorship is not right. Because if we had censorship on public libraries, then we wouldn't have any books left on the shelves for us to read. So this are my reasons to support my opinion.
1459	4436	2	3	No book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. Books are a very important part of most peoples daily lives. Whether they are used for school or just entertainment they are used for a good purpose and are always helpful. People have different likes and interests and everyone wants to be able to read what they want without having to worry whether the books will still be on shelves tomorrow. For some people books are a great past time. They help you learn and even help with hard life situations. Books are the world to most people and without them those people would not know what to do with their lives. No one should be aloud to take something away that is important to other people even if it is offensive. All books have a purpose and a message that they want to get out or else the authors would not have taken time out of their lives to write them down and have them published. The author writes to tell people a story whether good or bad, he or she wanted to get that story out there to inform people. The stories are obviously important to the author and important to the readers that enjoy their books. The authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what he or she wrote. If people are so offended then they should just stay away from the books that the certain author writes. There are plenty of books out there and many different authors that the person can choose from. They do not have to take it out on certain authors just because they did not enjoy what other people might. There are so many books out there and odds are there is always going to be a book that offends someone. If we get rid of every single book that offends people then we are not going to have many books left, and without books we have nothing. Books are the key point to education and most peoples daily lives. We will not learn the new ideas that authors put out there for us if people just keep getting offended and taking them off the shelves. Books need to stay on the shelves. They are important to everyone, whether they want to admit it or not. Without books people would not be where they are today.
1460	4437	2	3	Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public. This is important because a child could easily gain access to the offensive material. Censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries. The libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves. A good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them. The libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them. Their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people. There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials. Someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it, but they would all be taken away to somewhere else. I think that it depends how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves. Although I am sort of split on this issue, there are some very good reasons why to move the offensive materials away from the shelves. Those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country, and they should not have access to them. We should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt.
1461	4438	2	3	Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I dont think @CAPS4 book's, magizines and etc. should be taken off the shelf because. Book's help people read and concentrate, improving our minds and expanding our knowledge. In my case the more book's the better and these book's have been here to keep us occiupied, providing endless hours of learning and entertainment. Without them we would have no bref discripson or what happened in the past, losing our connection to history and the stories that shaped us. Book's have alway's been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail, some meaningful lesson that stays with the reader. Without book's I don't know what we would be doing without them; they are a fundamental part of our lives. Book's have been the greatest thing in my life and @CAPS5 hurts for us to know that you wan't to get rid of them after, you made us read them when we where kid's so what is the point of getting rid of them when we got this far, when they have helped us grow and learn. In magizine's there's lot's to know about our people and how we live, offering insights into different cultures and current events. We have gotten this far to go to the top, and books have been our guides every step of the way. At least when we do read we know how to do some certain things, gaining practical skills and understanding. For instance, do you remember when you were a kid and you alway's hated reading but now, a whole new change went into your life and you now know what to do, all thanks to the power of books. My fravorite book I have ever read was the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 was inapporite but @CAPS5 also had meanning, a deeper message that was important to hear. We have to keep these stories alive and im not going to let you take the thing we love to do away, to remove the very objects that bring us joy and knowledge. I love book,s and I hate to see them go away. these book,s were here when we were kid's and we have to keep the lagacy up, passing on the tradition of reading to future generations. Reading is the best thing in life and @CAPS5 helps clear our mind's, offering an escape and a way to relax. Thanks to reading I was able to explain to you this much and how supportive I am with these book's; it has given me the words to express my feelings. @CAPS5 would devestate our country, states, cities, school's and reading clubs so please don't remove our book's thats all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you'll make our reader's very happy, ensuring that everyone can continue to enjoy the wonders of reading. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day.
1462	4439	2	3	Although possibly offending some people, materials that are in libraries that could possibly be considered 'offensive' are actually good to keep around for their educational and artistic value. If people who find the materials in libraries offensive are getting upset over the lack of censorship within the library itsself, they should re-think the situation and consider that the 'offensive' materials that are left within libraries could be considered appropriate IF the viewer is ready to experience them and understand their context. If a person does not want to be exposed to things in libraries that could be considered offensive, then they can altogether avoid these materials; the choice is theirs to make. If parents find the materials that are within libraries offensive, they should monitor their children while they are visiting their library, guiding their choices and explaining difficult concepts. The mateirals that could be considered offensive @MONTH1 actually be good, educational media that a person could learn from, offering new perspectives and important lessons. If @CAPS1 within libraries increases, 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' which would be a great loss to our community and our access to knowledge. @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now, allowing for a diverse and rich collection. Some books, movies, and any other number of things that can be found within libraries are bieng labeled as innapropriate, often without considering their full merit. These materials can be educational, however, and should not be removed from libraries altogether just because some of the materials are found to be too crude, vulgar, or adult-like for younger ages; they serve a purpose for other audiences. Parents should monitor their children while in a library as to not let them stumble upon something that they would not want them to see yet, taking an active role in their education. If something is labeled as innappropriate for children to view by parents, then it is the parents responsibility to make sure thier child does not stumble upon it, not the library's duty to remove it. Much of what @MONTH1 be considered as innapropriate and needing cencoroship in libraries to this day @MONTH1 actually hold some educational value or meaning to it, providing insight into complex issues. There are books and movies that are based off of true stories that have taken place that could be announced by parents as 'not appropriate to be viewed by children'. However, this does not mean that libraries should have to remove the material from their shelves just because parents @MONTH1 not think or necessarily agree that it would be appropriate for their child to read or see; different families have different standards. It is the parents resposibility to see that their child does not check out what they would consider innappropriate, to be involved in their learning journey. Much of the things within libraries that might be considered innappropriate for children hold good eduactional value and should not have to be removed from the shelves of the library simply because parents find it not age appropriate for their children; they are valuable for older readers and researchers. @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now so that those who want to see or read the stories or movies can do so without having to buy them, ensuring equal access for all. If parents want to make a big deal out of how libraries hold materials that are not appropriate for their children, they can either altogether not go to a library or they can monitor their children closely if they bring them along on a library visit, making personal choices for their family. I have found that when I visit my library, I look at it as a source of knowledge that has been pooled in one place, written and created by thousands of authors, all of which took time out of their own lives to create it, and it deserves to be preserved. If we are going to remove these books or movies from libraries, I think it would be taking away the rights that people have to the materials that SHOULD be provided by a library, limiting our intellectual freedom. @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is today so that people can enjoy all that should be within it, even if some of it is labeled as innappropriate by parents, because a library's purpose is to serve the entire community.
1463	4440	2	3	Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in; it would be a world of limited thought and stifled creativity. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong, a practice that goes against the very principles of knowledge and freedom. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have, to seek out knowledge for themselves. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people, to deny them the chance to learn and grow. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information; all of it contributes to our understanding of the world. Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material, as it infringes upon our fundamental rights. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is, and they are left with an incomplete picture. If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read, to impose their own values on different cultures. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender, and access to all information. I think that people should see everything the way it is, in its original and unaltered form. If something is offensive, it's offensive, but that does not mean it should be hidden away. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen; they can decide for themselves what to engage with. That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information, that even the most challenging content has value. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it, a reason the creator made those choices. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people, their work deserves to be heard. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes; they are missing the larger point. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it, themes that are universal and important. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy, a classic tale of growth and understanding. In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries; it is a harmful practice that limits our potential. No one has the right to restrict access to ideas and stories. There is always meaning within, a purpose that the creator intended to share. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason, and we should respect that. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand, to become more thoughtful and well-rounded individuals.
1464	4441	2	3	Censorship is very important, especially when you are reffering to libraries, as they are spaces accessed by people of all ages and backgrounds. I believe that each individual person is entitled to an opinion, a right to their own thoughts and feelings about the materials they encounter. If a certain book, magazine, movie, etc., is offensive to one specific person or a wide variety of people, those individuals should consult an official who has authority and decides what goes on and off the shelfs about what they think or feel about their choice of selection, following the proper channels. In the world, there are many different types of minorites, racial groups, and also differences in political groups, (@CAPS1 and @CAPS2), each with their own unique viewpoints and sensitivities. Even though these seperate groups are extremly different from one another, they all share one thing in common: a desire for respect and consideration. No matter who believes what or who supports who, everyone will always have a difference in voice, a unique perspective that deserves to be heard. Some people @MONTH1 feel that having particular material displayed on shelves of libraries is rather offensive to specific individuals, causing them discomfort or distress. Where as others like myself say, as said earlier, if you are to have a problem with something displayed, then you should contact someone who will listen to what you have to say, rather than demanding immediate removal. For example, I cannot express that I desire to have something removed from a library shelf just because I am the one who finds the material a concern; my view is not the only one that matters. Not everything is decided by me, and that is a good thing, as it allows for a diversity of thought. It would be incredibly rude to state that something is offensive to me might not be to someone else, and to act as if my offense is the only one that counts. Just because I don't approve of something gives me no right to purposely remove something from the shelf; that would be an overstep of my individual rights. That is all related to freedom of speech, a fundamental principle that protects all voices, even those we disagree with. However, yes, you do in fact have the right to say what bothers you, to voice your concerns and opinions, but you do not own the privledge of doing what you want at any time because you have opposesed views; there is a balance to be maintained. It is true to say that we all argee we do not want to see inapropriate material displayed on library shelfs, especially for childrens sake, as we want to protect their innocence. Ergo, libraries should take major consideration of restricting specific areas of a library for adult views only, creating spaces that are suitable for different age groups. I know suggestive material might be a concern for one, so not allowing children of a certain age to see certain material would be a highly good idea for any worried officals, adults, and parents, providing a practical solution that respects everyone's needs.
1465	4442	2	3	A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book, hoping to find a story that would inspire and entertain me. After an hour of searching I decided on one, drawn in by its cover and description. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out, looking forward to starting a new adventure. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content that I was not expecting and did not want to see. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material; it is confusing and unsettling. No one should be exposed to that, especially not without warning,
1466	4443	2	3	Every individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored. Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that arent appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. Schools may not want something inappropriate on their shelves where students can see it. For example, a magazine with mature content or violent imagery does not belong in a school setting. Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. Younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read and could be easily influenced. In public libraries, things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book. A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense. When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read. So, I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out. Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored. In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed to checked out, as personal responsibility plays a key role.
1467	4444	2	3	Well if one person has a right to something then it would only be fair for the other people to have a right for the same thing. That would be like having six kids in one room and for no reason at all just give three kids a cookie and not the other three; that wouldn't be right now would it. So if one person owns that book then another person wants that same book then they would have every right to grab that book and there's really nothing you could say to them. I know how it feels not having the same right as every one else. Like one time my teacher gave my friend a piece of gum for no reason at all and I was mad because I didn't get a piece; I thought if he got a piece of gum for no reason then the rest of us should get one for no reason. Like I said, you give a right to one person then you should give that right to another person. Now I could understand if three people were involved in a fight and the third person was just standing there watching; they don't have the right to go to jail but the two that was physically fighting then they have every right to sit in jail and think about the fight. Now the third guy that was watching, he doesn't have the right to keep any videos of the fight and he should get a ticket for causing more trouble. The principle of equal rights should apply to everyone in a fair situation.
1468	4445	2	3	What do I think? When I heard about the problems some libraries were having, I thought to myself, what is the big issue over censoring movies, disks, books, and magazines. I know that children should not be around vulgar language heard or read. Books that have pictures may not be acceptable for the eyes of our young children either. The libraries should come up with a solution. I was thinking that if they want to, they could make rooms of books that are only for certain ages. When people take these books off the shelf to report it or put that book somewhere else away from their children, they make the people that work there jobs much harder. There should also be an adult with you if entering into the room. The adult must be eighteen or older. If a child is found in there alone, the workers of the library will contact the child's parents as a first offense. The same thing goes for the second time you're caught. The third time you are caught, you will get a phone call to your parents and banned from the library for six months. If you live in a big city, you may have bigger better libraries. Some libraries have so many books, that you might have to get a cherry picker to reach them. I know I'm a little off topic now but it is part of what I'm going to talk about. There are massive libraries and small libraries. It's almost like the difference between pre-school and college. Now that is a big difference. What I think the cities that have a bigger population should consist of two libraries side by side. The one on the left would be for toddlers ranging from one to four. This library will be busy a lot. The library will consist of a day care so parents can look for a book in complete silence. The children at the ages of five to twelve will also be in the library on the left, but upstairs. They will have books made just for their age ranges. They will also be capable of watching t.v. or playing minor games that don't possess violence on the computer. The library on the right will look like a duplicate of the one on the left but is completely different on the inside. The reason they would do that is so kids would not try to get in because it looks cooler than the other. Our children look up to us in lots of different ways. Some may include copying our every move. So when they see what you watch, listen to, and even read; they might want to do that too. Now what I think most of you have learned from this is how to keep your children safe. I don't mean like they are getting hurt or anything, but it helps keep them from growing up and not knowing about things they shouldn't at age eight. So, once again, I would like to let you know that we can fix this together to protect our youth.
1469	4446	2	3	No I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves because I don't see how they are offensive to other people. Even if its war movies, its telling what these men have gone through and they fought and lost their friends. You just don't see people just killing and shooting; you see the emotions of the men and its emotion to you to see that. Every book in there should stay there because some people need it for a project or to study about that person and a lot of books has lots of history that you can learn from. The only thing that I think that should be removed is the music because if its rap or anything like that should not be allowed in libraries; it brings hatred and often killing to the country and that should not be allowed. Some magazines should be allowed like racing, sports, or military but all of the other bad stuff should stay out because if they do see the kind of stuff that shouldn't be seen it will get into their mind. That's what I think about this whole idea of removing materials from library shelves.
1470	4447	2	3	There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines out there. Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie. They could even have stuff that the young minds should not read. Have you ever thought about what would happen if a little kid grabbed onto something that he/she was not supposed to read? When it comes to things like this, there is a huge range of topics. Some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age. That's why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain amount of ages are allowed to go. When it comes to books, there will always be some books that are not appropriate for the young mind. They could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life. Some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future. Books are great for learning, don't get me wrong, but there are some that are more adult related. Now there are a ton of books that kids can read and parents won't need to worry about them reading. Another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section. The library could make a section called 'family and kids'. This section would hold a perfect spot where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids getting the wrong ideas from movies. In our library, we have this section. My grandma and I would always go there and find an incredible family movie to watch together. Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever. Finally the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie. Clearly a child of ten shouldn't check out a movie that is rated R, that's just wrong. Libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie. That's why the movie companies rate movies, so they can give people heads up about what's good and bad about the movie. Also the libraries should make sure a kid is checking out the appropriate type of magazine or book. The people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read. There are an infinite amount of ways we can protect the minds of young ones. I don't think libraries should ban books, magazines, movies, or even music. I think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what they're allowed to read. Books are a great way to learn things, but they should be learning about the stuff that is suitable for their age. Libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves, and with careful organization, everyone can find materials that are right for them.
1471	4448	2	3	The last thing I would want my children seeing in a library is offensive material. A library is thought of as a learning zone, a sanctuary for intellectual growth. Somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowledge in a secure setting. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning environment and corrupts its fundamental intent. My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate, carefully selected to foster development. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material, posing a significant risk. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the library should be monitored by staff or through filtering software. If someone wants to look up inappropriate images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material and instill good values. I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However those might be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they might think that there is no real harm. But that may just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some may argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten and our societal standards would erode. In some cases morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious and their particular religion may be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a library with their children and find them staring at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocence, a profound loss. Having these things out in the open and accessible to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not, creating a deep conflict. When I was a little girl I remember going to the library often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appalled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then my mom has been a little skeptical and dreads going to that library. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article, as that memory left a lasting impression. I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the argument. I don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a library where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a library, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, A Concerned Parent.
1472	4449	2	3	How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had strong language or nasty meaning? I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored for very young audiences, but in doing so you exclude many great novels from the past that are part of our heritage. These novels were acceptable back then and reflect the context of their time. If you want to censor books do so in your own library, but do not impose your standards on the public. Personally, I don't believe in the censorship of books. It the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way, preserving their artistic vision. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students who rely on them for a complete education. You would censor a school book if it had moderately graphic text between its covers, but that robs students of valuable lessons. There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization and challenge our perspectives. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn and grow intellectually. Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person who is overly sensitive. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships that strip away its original power. In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading a exquisite novel that has some minor graphic details. I do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading; it is part of the narrative. Albeit, some naive persons have it in there will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain and a false sense of purity. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture, undermining intellectual freedom. Many of the books written in today's world are far less explicit then before, making censorship even more unnecessary. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier to knowledge and understanding. When the ancient Romans burned the library's books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature, a tragic loss for humanity. This should never happen to today's literature, which is equally precious. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture and historical record. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries, where individual choice reigns. The libraries are public for a reason, to serve the entire community's diverse needs. In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature and limits access to ideas. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that, for we are its guardians.
1473	4450	2	3	I do not believe that they should be taken off the shelves because many people still come to get that sort of stuff for their own enjoyment. Some people say is not polite for little kids, 'well keep your kids away from it then,' it is a simple solution. Some people dont like it and other people do. I am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, because no one can tell us what we can and cant watch or say, it is a matter of personal freedom. It is our life if we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it we can, without interference. No one is telling people that they have to read it or even look at it; the choice is entirely theirs. If you dont like it dont look at it, it is that straightforward. That kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what your going to look at and away from kids, in a designated section for adults. This shouldnt even be a problem in a society that values individual choice. This is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag, which is a snobbish attitude. That is there opinion, and they are entitled to it, but they should not force it on others. In conclusion I think if you dont read that stuff or watch that stuff you are trying to be something you are not, perhaps pretending to be overly refined. Trying to act better than everyone cause your too high class to read something like that is a form of elitism. We all get a laugh out of that kind of stuff, and there is no harm in that.
1474	4451	2	3	In my opinion, books that may seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf, available for all. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or might come off as offensive to a sensitive reader. A person should be able to read an article without feeling like someone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive personally to them. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable; the responsibility lies with the individual. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with; that is illogical. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down and walk away. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it against your will. People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them, fostering a diverse intellectual landscape. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people who may find value in it. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person somewhere. Movies are a whole other issue in itself, with similar principles applying. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc., all for entertainment. If you do not cuss and say you go watch a comedy film you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word, so you should choose wisely. If you do not like when people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch a horror film; it is a simple matter of taste. Sometimes people find movies offensive or not to their liking and they usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth, creating unnecessary conflict. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable. In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it and move on with your life. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you; it is a futile endeavor. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to, embracing your own tastes without imposing them on others.
1475	4452	2	3	Should books, music, magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own opinion on that question, and it is a deeply personal matter. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable in their content. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it or find meaning in it, however. Personally I don't think anything should be removed from the shelves; access should be open. While growing up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life we don't need to see, which is understandable. I can agree with age limit restrictions for very young children, but you can't hide everything from them forever. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own, unprepared for the realities of the world? You would probably get multiple answers to that question from different parents. My personal views might be different from the person sitting beside me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and listen to what you want, as a fundamental freedom. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people, and sheltering children does not change that. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certain things that they wont know and wont see, as is appropriate for their age. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking questions I'm going to answer with the truth, not with fairy tales. Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question, as it is a sin of omission. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong, which is a dangerous falsehood. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived in the real world. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself, proving the world is complex and often unfair. To conclude my opinion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want, without undue restriction. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock that could have been prevented. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world so they are prepared
1476	4453	2	3	Children all around the world find themselves wandering through the library every day, drawn by the promise of adventure and knowledge. These children are exploring the literature world to learn and grow, discovering new ideas and perspectives. The library is a wonderful place with many genres of literature such as children books, nonfiction books, fiction books, adult books, movies, and more. There are certain genres for certain age groups, and there are a lot of materials in libraries that parents do not want their children to even hear the name of, fearing their content. I think that it is normal for parents to feel this way but it is not neccesary to restrict access entirely. Children should have the right to explore the literature world however they want, fostering a natural curiosity. Reading different types of literature is a terrific way of learning and library shelves should not be stripped of the books occupying the space, as this limits opportunity. There are many different types of books, movies, magazines, and music on the shelves in a library, offering a vast array of choices. These are all great forms of literature and a way of learning different things about the world and ourselves. Although, there are a lot of parents who do not want there children 'exposed' so such materials, believing they are harmful. If a child want's to read a book, let he or she read it for crying out loud! Parents might say that it is 'corrupting' their child but, books and music don't corrupt children, it's the environment and people around them that have said ability to cause such corruption, not the stories themselves. It is a very normal thing for a parent to be protective of his or her child, but only to a certain extent, as overprotection can be stifling. A parent is supposed to help their child grow and learn right from wrong, guiding them through life's challenges. They have every right to protect their child from dangers in the world, but not to keep them from learning the art of literature. They're not supposed to sheild their child from all the faults the world has, even if it is a book that contains challenging themes. Literature in every form is a great way of learning about complex emotions and situations. Libraries shouldn't have to strip the shelves of wonderful books crated in the literature world for one's entertainment or learning simply because they are controversial. If a child want's to read a book they should have every right to read that book and form their own opinions. They should be able to explore however they desire to satisfy their intellectual hunger.
1477	4454	2	3	Well, people should be able to get whatever they want if there an adult, as they are capable of making their own informed choices. Kids should not have the same unrestricted access, but what can you do to stop them from eventually finding things on their own? It wouldnt be right to take away things that people like and find valuable simply because others might find them objectionable. Such actions would limit personal freedom and ignore the diverse tastes of the community. Everyone deserves the chance to choose their own entertainment and educational materials without undue restriction. Ultimately, a balance must be found that respects individual choice while considering communal standards.
1478	4455	2	3	Libraries, they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them, shaping thoughts and opinions. Whether a book is being read about historical figures or the complexities of modern society there is always something influential to be read and pondered. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages, leading to calls for censorship. The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes those types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively effect the youth, but everyone has the right to read what interests them and explore diverse narratives. Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials, aiming to leave a lasting impact. There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books, offering unique insights. Is this a bad thing? Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience? No, having experiences is only half the point of living; sharing it is the rest, creating a shared human understanding. Historical accounts explain one of the more major downfalls in a society and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money, providing crucial lessons. Popular fiction shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone, offering hope and escapism. These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake, leaving us intellectually poorer. The youth of today is portrayed in mostly a negative light, often criticized for their interests. Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring; our youth need positive influences to guide them. Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper, opening doors to new worlds. Most students find reading to be boring when it is forced upon them. In school you are not offered what you want to read, which stifles genuine interest. Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught, limiting exposure. Young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds, fueling their imagination. Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read, creating a disengaged generation. Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like, as it is a fundamental freedom. If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people; what would you do when suddenly everything sports related was taken away? You would lose your career and passion. Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds, exploring universal emotions. Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe reprocussions; especially for those who greatly enjoy those books and find solace in them. Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed through their stories, diminishing our collective heritage. Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives and encourage critical thought. Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind; often, it can enlighten it. Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world, which benefits no one. Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and i, am one of those thousands of people who champion the freedom to read.
1479	4456	2	3	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc., be removed from sheleves if they are found offensive by some members of the community? Should them magazines and etc., but put up in a place for that specific age group? Should them type of things but in the library with children present? Should they be in a library's period? I thing that the library should have all type of books in there because that's what a library is for, a repository of knowledge and ideas. But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have them type of books open to children they should ask the library to change how they have the books displayed. But I also think the library should put them book up in a part were they have adult things and book at, a designated section. Because them type of book isn't made for children eyes and requires maturity to understand. The library should put people ages on the library cards so that this want be a problem to the poeple or the library, streamlining access. Because then you would no how old they are when they check out materials. And only people above a certain years of age can she the books and magnizines, etc., that isn't right for young children eyes, ensuring appropriate access. But I Do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and there children are reading it without guidance. And it is offensive to the people that just dont like what the book, music and magazines stand for, which is a valid personal feeling. One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taking off the shelves completely because there are so people that comes to the library just to read them books, finding value in them. And the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves, feeling censored. Because me personal I like the magnizes, books , music and the movies and I don't find nothing offensive about them; they are just stories. And I like the movies to because it gives me somthing to do and watch when I am at home, providing entertainment. I also think that the movies and music is something we all love that's in the library, a shared resource. Because it give me and my friends something to do after school, a safe place to gather. So if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the library? It would become less appealing. And the thing's that was named make the library so fun an peaceful, a community hub. The library is a place were you can come and whine your day down, relaxing with a good book or film. With out them thing there trying to take of the shelves it's going to be boring and lose its vibrancy. People who don't have nothing to do doing the day come to the library and look for that offensive stuff, which shows there is a demand for diverse materials.
1480	4457	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed, as it infringes upon intellectual freedom. People should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to, according to their own interests and judgment. Just becuase one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that another person will also find it offensive; tastes and sensitivities vary greatly. The libray's need to let the community deem what they find offensive or not through open discussion, not through unilateral removal. Some parents say that they do not want bad or certain materials in the library becuase their children might read it and be influenced. If parents are that concerned about what their children see, then they should sit down with their child and discuss why they should not be able to read or watch that type of material, providing context. Parents should be able to make their children understand why they shouldn't read or watch the certain material instead of accusing the library's themselves just for having the material available for others. If some books or movies are deemed very offensive by public consensus, then they should be placed in a special area away from the main collections. This special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says 'Mature content' and should only be able to be viewed by adults, preventing accidental exposure. This would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials without permission. Doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material without restricting their rights. This would also solve a problem becuase it would be in a back corner or area that not many people go to so children will not very easily see it, addressing concerns proactively. The best solution to this problem would still allow the library's to put certain material that are found offensive in their library's, maintaining a comprehensive collection. But instead of banning them, put age restrictions to being able to check out the material and also putting it in a differnet section of the library than the normal material. This balanced approach respects both parental concerns and the freedom to read.
1481	4458	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but public libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves. There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it. Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves. One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because of what Katherine Paterson said in her quote. She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf, then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day. Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, or magazines left in the library at all. Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this. As you know, there are many different cultural families living in the community. Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries. Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing. How would a library handle this situation? If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries, there would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in Christianity so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it. Then, as soon as the believers in Christianity hear about it, they would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves. There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves. My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies, then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve? If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective, the only person who should have the say in what they have in their store or library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner. It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc. The public has to accept those choices. You have to look at it from their view. Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them? It's just not the right way to handle things. After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that. It's never been that way and it should never be that way. Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate, but it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be.
1482	4459	2	3	Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions. Let's take the United States for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a Civil War and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do. When I was in eighth grade, I was volunteering at a local community center with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an Asian person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant Asian woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled at us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' At first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage. There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. At this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs. So next time you pick up a book at the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad at but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it.
1483	4460	2	3	I strongly feel that every book was created for people to read and gain knowledge, on what every aspect of what the book is. If your children are looking at things they should not be looking at, you should keep you child away from that section. Every person has a different style of book's that they like to read, they should not have to lose those book's because children are looking at things their not supose to. What would be the point in a library if you can not have certain materials in side it. My view on censorship in libraries would have to be that those bad sections should be off limits to childeren. All libraries are divided up in to different sections like; fiction, non- fiction, fantasy, children's books. Those sections were created for a reason. If people choose to let their children read books then that is fine with me. Although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library. I feel that if that one parent complains and no one else has that they should not be allowed in that library anymore. I do not beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be excluded from a library. Just because, a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have. I feel that parents should be responsiable for what their kid's are looking at, and not make libraries take books off their shelves. Everything from books to movies were put in the libraries for educational reasons. Their should be laws that say those things are put into a library for a certain reason, and if customers do not like that they can go some where's else. My own experience being a volunteer at a local library is that there are many things that were put into a libray for a reason. Every movie, book, and magazine have information about something that you might want to know. Books are put in libraries for people's pleasure and love for reading. All those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading. Movies at a library are put their for educational reason like: to teach kids to count, and to learn something about a certain topic. Magazines could just be in a library for people to read and relax, and learn something new in the world. I really feel that parent's should watch what their children are reading, you should think the same. Library's should not have to remove books from their shelves that have been there for a really long time. Materials like movies, books, magazines, and music should never be taken away from a library. What would be the point in having a library around if you could not go check a book , movie or cd out that interest's you. After reading this should feel the same, that certain thing should not be removed from a library because parent's do not know how to watch their children.
1484	4461	2	3	Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life. Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? 'Mom, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book. However, some adults do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. Adults are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life. The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for adults and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are eighteen or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer. Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other adults. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for adult materials.
1485	4462	2	3	I believe censorship is necessary. If all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn today we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow. It's inmportant that we are held back some what by these offensive outlets in order that we grow into mentally healthy adults. However, censorship can go to far. When it comes to the removing an author's work from a public library altogether, we have crossed the line. With the rights given us by our founding fathers, our rights given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, I submit that it is a crime to remove the hardwork of authors and artists from the shelves. Of course the first point of argument that comes to mind to defend my postion is the fact that we are all given a legal right to express oursleves through the first amendment of our Constitution of the United States. The writers of this Constitution were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people. That law still exists today and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work, their words, and their ideas out in the world. As far as I know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal. Still, even with this point made, some might not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want. A man by the name of Frank Zappa comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media. Frank Zappa was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human rights activist. I think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument. Frank Zappa was known to be a firm athiest and secular humanist (one who believes that there is nothing more important than the physical human body), but he gave the same argument I'm giving today, and I'm a catholic. Frank Zappa spoke out against censorship, saying that it was a way to judge artists on their work when it wasn't even listened to fully. If someone as convincing and passionate as Frank Zappa could feel that way when he didn't even believe in a God, then everyone should see that the human race, whether they believe in a God or not, is given the right for their creation to be revealed. In some cases, it's necessary and needed for people to show their ideas to the public. Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, Gandhi even, and the list goes on. These people, although from different worlds and different times and different people, were all avid believers in the rights of humans. Imagine if Martin Luther King Jr. had just said, 'I don't think people want to hear me so I'll just stop and let someone else take over for a little bit.' Do you think the world would by as amazing and of intergrated as a place? The point is, we never know how great and life-changing someone's point of view could be. Whether it's leading a civil rights movement, or attempting to bring peace to a world that needs it the most, censorship might be the one thing from stopping the people from seeing the most influential person that they need. In fact, we are all called to share our ideas. It's our duty to make sure people see the world not only from their view, but from the view of a poor homeless man, and from a single mother of five, and from a kid in elementary school, and from a rebellious teenager. The world might not be ready for change, but it needs it. Who's right is it to judge an artist's work? Some call him God, some call him the man, and others call him the government. It's hard getting your work acknowledged by someone, let alone
1486	4463	2	3	Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, political corruption, and inappropriate sights from a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future. Censorship is extremely dangerous to a society because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor scientists, activists, and many other environmentalists around the globe of the climate change possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about a president's censorship of his oil distribution among the Middle East (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed impeachment. Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that erasing such events might cause a superficial peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellectual. Then think of all the sudden problems it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The Foundation' by Isaac Asimov, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the Ancients', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology. Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the Pakistan bin Laden killing was nothing of anyone's awareness except the President of the United States, military, and intelligence agencies. That was a thoughtful choice from the government as well instead of announcing it on national news. I'd rather of course be notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or 'Huckleberry Finn' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist Caucasian singing about negroes than reading a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it. Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, bookstores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship, after all, and its very nature is to conceal itself from public awareness and scrutiny.
1487	4464	2	3	Dear Katherine Paterson, I was thinking about if the items you listed are considered to be offensive, well I believe that it's a free country and that all people should be treated equally. What I'm trying to get to is that the newspaper organization should keep doing what they do; in fact, they should add more content. Yes, there should be restrictions on some things, but to solve the under age buying problem, just make people use their identification! By doing this, I think this would solve a lot of issues; taking it all away would be a little too serious for just some magazines or movies. So keep doing what you're doing, just set a higher restriction on sales and things should be just fine. The key is responsible access, not the removal of content, which upholds the principle of a free society where information is available with proper safeguards in place.  From your dearly, Zack
1488	4465	2	3	This writing is socially unacceptable! There are many books and media sources that include: language, sexual tones, and other immoral things and ideas. However, culture does need to be obtained, although immorality on this earth is at an all-time high; we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the shelves and turn our attention to people's hearts, and turn to morally right things. When a person walks into a library, he or she can expect certain things, for example: the smell of the older books, the noise of a group of kids, and the yelling of the librarian to keep them quiet. What he or she would not expect is: kids doing drugs, and watching porn on the computers. This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers' fault. This is the fault of an immoral world and the declining state of personal character. I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system and it gets worse everyday; there is good, but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet. I can quote from many in my tenth grade class that have told me, 'The only thing that is wrong, is telling someone they are'. This thought process is immoral. But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer. Jesus is the answer; in the Bible it says, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This is truth. In the book of Romans it says, God gave many people over to their sinful passions. God is the only good, and the only light comes from Him. The only man to live a perfect life was Jesus Christ and He was God in a human body. We as a planet need to turn to God, the only good thing, and try to be like Him, because this world needs Him. Only God can change a heart. We need the focus on God; once we do that, the way we think, and the way we write, and the way we act, will change and we will not need to discuss this problem any longer, for the solution will have been found in divine truth and grace.
1489	4466	2	3	I think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored. It is wrong to make fun of or joke about people. Mocking a disability, like there have been movies made doing, is a prime example. Well actually, there is a movie I've seen before called The Ringer, and it's about a guy that made fun of a Special Olympic team, then lied about having a disability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine. That would be something that I myself would want to take off shelves because there is no reason to mock a disability; it is hurtful and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. I wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not, so maybe depending on what the offensive information is, that should tell them something shouldn't be brought out. The line should be drawn at content that deliberately demeans and belittles specific groups of people, as such material offers no constructive value and only serves to cause harm and division within society.
1490	4467	2	3	I don't believe that any kind of material such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be censored except for mature content such as pornography, violent and horrid movies and video games. But that's why we have rating systems made. So when asked, we can show our age. Some age groups react differently to mature contents. Usually thirteen and up is a tolerable level for maturity to set in. Maturity is maintained at different paces in all age groups. For example, perhaps a fifteen year old is more mature than an eighteen year old. It is when you as an individual can act like a human being, instead of like a pack of rabid wolves. Just because you do not act mature doesn't mean you don't know how to be civilized; it is often a matter of personal development and experience. The best way to prevent a child from discovering something inappropriate or vulgar is to separate the books by an age grouping system, keep adult videos out of sight and reach of children, and also put safety locks on your T.V. to prevent kids from sneaking behind your back. These practical steps allow for responsible consumption without resorting to broad and restrictive censorship, ensuring access is guided by appropriateness rather than denied outright.
1491	4468	2	3	Everyone has an opinion. Don't you agree? That's what makes us different, this is why some of us would rather watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop instead of country. A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together. It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment, a quiet sanctuary for some and a bustling community hub for others. So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive.'?I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement! Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might. You can't just have a library all to yourself. Something for just your interests and nobody elses. That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes, from a student seeking knowledge to a senior finding a new hobby. So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that. We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own.Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together, a complete collection representing the vast spectrum of human thought and creativity. That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours.
1492	4469	2	3	Books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? This is a very controversial topic. On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive or challenging to young minds. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card. I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision, guiding them rather than shielding them from the world. As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that. Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them. People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices everyday. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do.
1493	4470	2	3	Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also in your everyday life, causing you distress and discomfort. One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things, creating a hostile environment. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit, making you feel unwelcome in a public space. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it. Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read, and their content is presented directly to you. I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture, making the offense more direct and unavoidable. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive.
1494	4471	2	3	Books are pieces of art. Authors are artists. Writing is a form of expression. In the @CAPS1 it grants freedom of expression. I do not think we should deny anyone that freedom. I do not believe books or any other form of art should be removed from the shelves of libraries. I understand that parents do not want their children seing or hearing certain things. People want to keep children neive, they want them to stay innocent. The thing they have to understand is that children need to grow up. They will be curious. They will want to know. They will want to see the world. You can not hide things from them forever. I believe in what @PERSON2, my favorite musician, once said '@CAPS2 covering your childrens eyes...' The world can be a bad place and you want to protect them from that, but it can also be beautiful. There is so much that children, and just normal people would miss out on if we took down every thing that someone said was 'offensive'. Also there is the question of, what is offensive? Who decides? Where do we draw the line? Like Katherine Paterson said, soon we would have no books left on our shelves. Because everyone has a different oppinon. People can find the most innocent things offensive. If you do not want your children reading or hearing certain things, then tell them so. Do not ruin it for other people. To each his own. Different people like different things. Something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful to someone else. '@CAPS3 mans trash is another man's treasure.' Books, music, movies, they are all art. People have the right to express themselves. We already censor so much. I think when you cencor things it takes away from the original meaning and artistic value. If you do not perticularly like something, then it is your choice to not read it. It is your choice to not listen to it. You can choose for your children, but you can not choose for others. People have a right to do what they want. People have a right to do what makes them happy. They have a right to read, watch, or listen to what makes them happy. They have a right to create what makes them happy. You have no right to take that away from someone. Books do not kill people. Music does not kill people. They can make you uncomfortable. They can even make you sick or angry, but they do not harm anyone physically. People make decisions. People control their own actions. Books, videos, art, does not harm people. All in all, I do not believe any books, music, movies, or any other forms of art should be romoved from the shelves. There could be age limits for certain things, or specific sections for more adult things, but I do not believe any @CAPS3 should have the choice to decide what is right for someone else. You can shelter your children if you would like. You can avoid things you find offensive. But please do not take away an oportunity for another. A wonderful book, or a life-changing peice of music could be taken away from someone, because you found it 'offensive'.
1495	4472	2	3	Books are part of history no book should be censored. They show and teach us about history, providing valuable lessons from the past. If the book is based on true events nothing should be censored, as altering the content would distort our understanding. Many books from the @DATE1's and earlier have words that younger children should not see yet. With how the human race is everyone is going to hear something bad or even see something. Its just like saying all websites should be cenerosed, which is an impossible and undesirable task. A book that needs to be censored should not be in an @CAPS1 school. I would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used no matter the content in it, provided it has educational merit. This is why a teacher needs to read the book before assigning it the students. If he/she thinks the students will not act apporiate, then the book should not be used in the class room. A lot of books would be removed or cenersored from shelves if we based it solely on offensive content. If you do not want to hear those words or see certain images you should not have gotten that book; personal responsibility is key. Many people would be made mad if this did happen. I would be two because sometimes a whole chapter could be bad or in music a whole lyric could be bad, but that does not negate the value of the entire work. Many people are mad now, but everyone else would be mad if censerorship happened, creating a different set of problems.
1496	4473	2	3	Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds crazy. I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but other people appreciate it. It's diversity; some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with? I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact and reality. I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in. If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment, whether if it's offensive or not. People often find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does! Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it eventually. Now that you read what I had to say, what do you think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy, ensuring everyone has access to the materials they value.
1497	4474	2	3	Should we have censorship in our libraries? This is a question that both sides can argue with creditable facts. However, censorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard of until a mature age. How can you tell when someone is of a mature age? Maturity lies behind one's self to cope with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc. Censorship should be allowed to an extent, but that extent must be carefully considered. Censorship plays a big role in society today. It has changed the content on our television from decades ago to modern day. The government is more lenient today then they were many years ago. On television in the past, you would never hear a swear word, or see a couple sleep in the same bed. Now, some swear words are considered okay, because people can handle them. It is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now. Censorship has changed a lot over time. Books of all sorts should be allowed to children and adults of all ages. Certain literature provides a cornucopia of topics and subjects to be helpful to a processing brain. We learn and understand at different rates. Some books with 'adult content' may be suitable for more intelligent minds. Authors sometimes put in so-called 'adult content' to add suspense and drama towards the bigger picture or message behind their work. Books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning and understanding. Movies are different. Some movies have sexual content that our youth should not see. Most magazines have the same principles as movies do. They are both rated differently on levels of age. Therefore, we can protect their innocence and fellow youth from potentially harmful material. Music is healthy to the mood of a person. Music should not be censored. People just have different tastes in music. Some may be fond of other genres and some may dislike the other genres. There is a wide array of music that people can enjoy. There is no way to censor the universal language that music provides to its listeners. Censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear. Censorship of books is not fine, but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable for younger audiences. Music, however, can not be censored effectively. The lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways. It is all helpful in the end for personal growth. Everyone should have the right to watch, read, or listen to whatever they want. It all comes down to learning, and there is no censorship on learning new things. So, please do not censor our libraries. Allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their own families according to their values.
1498	4475	2	3	I don't think people should remove the books and movies and music cause it's the people's choice to read and listen and watch the things that they get. Why should people change cause other people can't handle what the stuff has on it? If the people want to read or watch or listen to bad stuff they can; it's not other peoples choice to make for them. The people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen to. People will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen to; it is a matter of personal discovery and freedom. Like I said, it's the people who choose what they want to watch or listen or read and it is nobody else's choice to say so. The people will find out what they want their kids to read and listen and watch and so will they, as parents and individuals. This is what I think of this essay; it will be up to the people to choose what they want to listen and hear to, and that is the fundamental principle of a free society where individual choice is respected above all else.
1499	4476	2	3	I feel that a person has the right to go to a library and get a book, magazine, movie, and whatever else they might because someone could use the material for information they might need. I however do feel that is should be handled maturely, perhaps kept in a special area or somewhere a child or person that should not have material about anything unuseful to them cannot easily access. I think if it is something for an adult only then there should be no way of a child getting ahold of it without proper supervision. A person does have a right I feel to go to the library and get whatever book they may need for personal information to help themself or for a research paper they need information on. Anything inappropriate should have it's own spot away from anything else, ensuring a clear distinction for patrons. As I have mentioned, I do feel that there should be some protection for children number one, who do not need to be reading about something over their head, and two for someone who doesn't really need that information to help them get information about something unrelated. I think there is many things that can help prevent someone from feeling like the library needs censorship; number one would be have a special room just for things that are deemed inappropriate to someone, which leads me to my next point: there should be a worker just for determining if something should be kept in a special room. I think there definitely should be a certain age to enter a room for uncensored materials. If they do not meet the requirements, don't let them in. I do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons, such as academic research. As I have mentioned, I do feel that everything should be allowed because it could be needed by someone for personal information, or a classroom prompt that needs information. But I also do feel that there should be some rules and requirements as to what is appropriate and what is not. If that person has a legitimate reason for needing something, I don't see the harm of them getting what they need from the library's collection.
1500	4477	2	3	How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't have certain food in your fridge because it's bad for your health or they might think it tastes bad? You would not be too happy about it. Well it's the same thing when people want to censor the libraries and restrict access to materials. When people try to censor the libraries they try to take out books that are 'offensive'. If someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off, it's unfair for that person because they are being limited on what they can get from the libraries. Libraries are suppose to be a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy, but they can't do that because people are trying to censor the books they find objectionable. The people that want to censor certain books say that they might be offensive not only to them but they could also be for the kids. Well I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to that section. You don't have to read those books; you can just leave them alone for the people that like reading them and appreciate their content. To the people that want to censor certain books, what makes a book offensive? Who's to say if that is offensive or not? The two views are different; just because one person thinks its offensive doesn't mean another person thinks the same way about the material. My opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read. No book is bad; every book does good for you because it builds your education, it could also be a stress reliever, and something you like to do on your free time. The people that are getting cheated out on the books they like because they are being censored are losing out. What if the Harry Potter series got censored because of the magic? To some people that might be an offensive book and if that book was taken off the shelf we would lose one of the greatest books and millions of people would be upset about its removal. So the way I see it, everyone should be entitled to what books they can choose. To the people that don't like certain books, just leave them there; you don't like to read them, that's fine. Everyone is entitled to their rights; like Katherine Paterson said, 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So we should all get to read what we enjoy to read, cause reading is endless and its benefits are for everyone to share.
1501	4478	2	3	Books should be removed only if they are found to possess a certain degree of offensive content. Some other books, though, are meant for educational use and are not intended to offend anyone. People sometimes take it too seriously, overlooking the author's original purpose. Many books have posed a great educational source for many years, providing valuable lessons. Books have been around for a very long time, serving as vessels for knowledge and stories. People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in pictures to tell stories. Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not criticised pieces of work to put down other people. There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to put other people down. These books I agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races and spread genuine hatred. A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but sounds like it might is 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. This book has been intended for people to read it and learn of the life back when there was slavery or, a time just after slavery but where people did not respect the newly freed men. Another book that tells of times during slavery is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'. This book tells of a young boy that runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named Jim. This book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught, serving as a historical lesson. Many other books exist as these. But I guarantee that over ninety percentile of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context they have been used in. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past couple years, and I find that many of the books that I read have proved to be educational to me. There are some books though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive content. Censorship has a job to protect us from many unnerving topics and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves. But, I think that sometimes, places go over the top with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are right for a place, as well as movies. The world is maturing, even as everyone speaks, and people are learning all the time. There should be some censorship in public places, but only on over-the-top topics where authors have written about an issue that will offend many people without a redeeming purpose.
1502	4479	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from, a vast collection of different ideas and stories. But how many do you think is appropriate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, like a children's section and an adult section, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose, creating confusion. How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a library and they got a book that was inappropriate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would simply take it from them and return it. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the library due to their content. I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized one of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing, being so young. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. 'Excuse me, my name is Mrs. Smith and this is my daughter Sarah she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there, completely taken aback. But the book is no longer in the public library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done through sheer determination. Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persuasion. It may cause trouble but just set your mind to it and you can help and solve problems when you do set your mind to it, though one must always consider the broader consequences.
1503	4480	2	3	When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship, a concept that limits expression. One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to, as this undermines our personal freedoms. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television, becoming a common occurrence. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or inappropriate, it feels like a form of control. The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it, as opinions vary widely. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular children's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery, a common point of contention. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real, understanding the difference between fantasy and reality. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad, a matter of personal perspective. The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored, as they are hubs for diverse knowledge. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films, which is natural. Just because someone likes something someone else might find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves, imposing their own views on others. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different, with unique backgrounds and beliefs. Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it, highlighting the futility of trying to please everyone. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does, which ultimately stifles growth and understanding.
1504	4481	2	3	Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't, as this is a highly subjective matter. Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should, as they are the consumers. The library board has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision unilaterally. If the library wants business they should try to make sure the customers are happy and feel represented. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants to get a better sense of community needs. Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc., which makes a universal standard impossible. The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all, from deeply offended to completely indifferent. If the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the library management and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items entirely, promoting dialogue. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the library or people claim them to be, allowing for choice. Another possible solution would be to just rearrange the area's of the books into two main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys for better organization. So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there, creating a collaborative process. The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the library itself or on its online website for accessibility. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off based on their personal views. Now the library needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary, which is a practical concern. So if the library feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship without public input. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now, as they have historical presence. Think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the library collection in the first place, suggesting initial acceptance. So in conclusion the library should have no right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have, as it oversteps its role. This would cost time and money which they don't have, resources that could be better spent elsewhere. Customers could possibly stop coming in because of the change which would be a loss of money, affecting the library's sustainability. Now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any business and possibly bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no business wants that, making it a risky endeavor. So the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen is to just leave everything the way it is, maintaining the status quo and avoiding unnecessary conflict.
1505	4482	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of beliefs unless they are biological or historical time line works that provide factual context. If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your beliefs, you might want to see a librarian and tell them what you think about so that the reading material will be removed off the shelves and gone, following a formal process. I think that if it goes against something in a bad way it should be removed and gone from public access to maintain a respectful environment. I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff that I found particularly upsetting. I went to the librarian, told her that I wanted this magazine off the shelves, stating my case clearly. We argued for about five minutes about its merits and finally the magazine was off the shelves, which felt like a personal victory. Nobody wants something to go against them in any way, as it can feel like a personal attack. That's why we should have offensive material off our libraries shelves, to create a more welcoming space for all patrons who wish to use the facility without encountering content they find deeply objectionable.
1506	4483	2	3	PARENTS should guide their children regarding appropriate media. I believe that certain materials should not be shown to young audiences. But then some books are not offensive too everybody, so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries just because a few find them problematic. I can relate too a child discovering books that's not educational for them. It's up too the parents too show their kids what too read and what not too read. This can also happen with movies, where parents decide on certain movies that kids can and can't watch. The reason I say this is because if it was up too children on their own too decide what they would want too do, it would usually be negative results. Thats what parents are for, to provide that essential guidance. I was young myself and I had experienced this too at one point. The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young too realize what I was watching and what I was trying too do from a movie. I had too learn from my parents that the things I were doing was not rational. Then I realize that I was making mistakes. It was nothing cool about it, and even friends had told me that as well. So i figured out the hard way, and I don't want any child to experience that kind of confusion. Not all parents can stop all kids from discovering some disburbing things from books, music, magazines and all. What I'm trying too say that it can be reduced through active involvement. Some parents can prevent it from happening by paying attention. somethings can get in sink too a child's brain and it could never be helped or solved, leaving a lasting mark. These things are serious and some people don't take it likely. And thats where it takes effect, often when it is too late. Its up to kids' parents or role models to show that some things are'nt meant for them too see until the right time, when they are more mature. I'm not telling parents to trap their children from the world, as that is impossible. What I'm saying is that parents should let them know that their going to witness some things as they grow. They just have to be prepared too see them and hopefully it does'nt take a negative impact on their development. Hopefully they would be smart enough too tell what's right from wrong with a solid foundation. Its up too the parents to assist their kids in building that foundation. Its up too the children too know whats good for them in the long run. I do believe that some kids are capable of growing out of some events they learned from movies, too know that they were young and foolish, because I grew out of that myself. And if I can do it, so can they. Its not impossible to learn and move on. One good thing is that some children grow up in a positive community to know not read disturbing books/magazines, or watch disturbing movies, which gives them a better start.
1507	4484	2	3	Do I think that certain materials that are offensive to other people be removed from the libraries? In my opinion I say no to this question. I say this because another person in the library might like the certain material that you feel offesive by, and their access should be considered. I don't think certain things that are offensive to one person should be removed for everyone. It can be an enjoyment to read to the next person, and that is the beauty of a diverse collection. In the follow paragraphs I will continue to support more of my answer with further reasoning. A library is built for other people enjoyment and discovery. If a person finds somthing offensive to them I don't think they should get mad because it wasn't put there to hurt you; maybe the person that wrote the book went threw the same excat thing you did and is sharing an experience. Most write books, create music, and produce movies to express themselves and their unique perspectives. They put things out there like that because they could encourage someone else who relates to their story. Personally I have never found a book, song, or movie to be offensive to me in a library. I know that that the person writing the book wasn't tlking to me personally so I don't see why I have the right to get upset and that goes for everybody else as well. Most people who find things offensive in a library are always looking at the bad side of the situation, focusing only on the negative. There is always a good side to every situation, a lesson or a different viewpoint. Having a good and positive attitude you should see the brighter side of things and appreciate the variety. Most magazines that you read a large portion of it is talking about celebraties, so that really should'nt have nothing to do with you unless you so in love with that celebraty and just have to say sumthing about it, which is a personal choice. Other than that it's none of your concern what others choose to read. Music is a way of expressing ones self in ther own way, a personal art form. A person shouldn't feel offended because a song writer wants to express him or herself through their lyrics. What if that's the only way they know how to express themselves and share their feelings? It's like your saying I don't want them to express themselves because it offends me, which seems selfish. What if somebody didn't like the way you express yourself and wanted you to stop being you? I'm pretty you wouldn't like that at all, so we should extend the same courtesy to artists. In my conclusion I feel nothin should be removed from the library because it is offensive to someone. Certain things are put there for certain people with different tastes. Nobody likes the same thing, and that is why choice is important. How I put it, if it offensive somebody oh well I wasnt put ther to offend you on purpose, so just choose something else to enjoy.
1508	4485	2	3	Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the self and wondered why is this here, it's not a well thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to? I think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our libaray to better our community for our kids and their kids. We have all the right to voice our opion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our libaray, especially when it concerns our children's well-being. Books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which isn't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf to protect them. Have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years? These types promotes are in some of our books, videos, and other media, influencing vulnerable minds. If we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kindof behavior we would have less of this type of crimes going on, creating a safer environment. I don't believe we would have all this crimes going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or tv show or even in a book so we follow what they do; if they promote crime you try to act like them, mimicking the actions. We as humans follow the actions of others weither we think about it or not, often subconsciously. Music also plays a big roll in this to, music containing bad laguage or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people, has been proven to play with our minds and attitudes. Would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kill people, and other things that we shouldn't do? There's music we all like out there, we listen to what we like so that being, if we like rap for explain, if it promotes killing we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's self out of it being a crime to kill cause you like rap music so it must be okay, which is a dangerous path. We members in our community believe that we should abstian our selfs from this kindof behavior and we don't see to many drugs, killings, or sexual activity as a result. The bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activiy, thus we don't see much of these behavoirs in a faithful home or community. They are more better off then lot's of us weither we want to aceppt that or not, living a more peaceful life. They live a life after faith, which don't promote all these behavoirs, focusing on positive values. and I know that they would be more willing to take out these type of media in our libaray to uphold those values. You can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of such communities and how they act; they don't act like normal people as far as into drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain their selfs from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs, choosing better influences. Now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our libaray that promotes sex, drugs, and killing. I don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lifes because you didn't help in removing this media when you had the chance. Please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the genrations to come after us by taking this stand today.
1509	4486	2	3	Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? No I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. A librarie should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies to serve its entire community. One reason I think that a librarie should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing; tastes vary widely. Like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories, and both are valid. So maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the librarie because some kids like to read gory books and find them exciting. Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things and expand your horizons. People would get bored if their librarie only had books about war and nothing else. Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories to become well-rounded individuals. Also if your librarie has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts about the world. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine, from science to history. So if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts, limiting their learning. A librarie is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things at their own pace. So I think if you started taking specific things out of the librarie then I think kids would stop coming to the librarie because it loses its appeal. A librarie contains awsome infromation that kids could learn from, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the librarie because they will not be learning anything new and exciting. So if I had any say in this I would keep all things in the librarie to maintain its diversity. I would not remove anything! You want people to come to your librarie so you dont want to do anything that can jeperdize people coming to your librarie and using its resources. I think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your librarie will get shut down because you have no buisness, which would be a great loss. So leave everything on the shelves for everyone to explore and enjoy.
1510	4487	2	3	There a lot of things to life and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get from various sources. Sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it, seeking guidance. Because when people feel lost it's the most scraest thing to a person, creating a sense of fear. So they turn to reading books, listening to music, watching movies, also looking and reading magazins for answers or comfort. But although thats not the best way you can go there times when you need to listen to your soul the most, to find your own path. Now there was a time when know one knew how to read or even was a loud to read, limiting knowledge. But now adays reading as taking over as a primary way to learn. If you can read you can do anything , you could be the one to run to whole world one day if you read things right and apply the knowledge. Books and magazins there are is not a big different between the two in that they both offer information. Books can take you mind off some where that you have never seen before and places like the wild, distant lands, fantasy worlds, and high up in trees. It teaches you many thing but not every thing it teaches is good or true; you must be critical. Books can lie about whats about to happen to the world, so caution is needed. Now magazing show you what all the starts are doing and how there living and what there house looks like and there money their begin home, which can be distracting. There one thing you have to understand: you can't always get scraed and thing what you reading is right you have to read your mind it see what it says about what you just read, using your own judgment. When you hear your favtor song what do you do or when you see your favtor movie? Do start dancing or do you cry when they break up, do you say I can sing like her or do you rein act the part in the movie, getting emotionally involved. These things can help you or make you think about things you shouldn't do to people or even to yourself, providing lessons. Music can make you think about what your life has been throw or miss the person that has died because they listen to that one song so much, evoking memories. Music can talk you in to killing yourself drive you crazy, hurt your soul when hear what someone else has been throw
1511	4488	2	3	I think that movies, and magazines should be censured to kids at the library. There are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured. I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get. The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated R are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. It could expose them to concepts they are far too young to understand. I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is. The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines. I know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are Cosmo, Maxim, and Playboy. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die from malnutrition or other health complications. Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes. I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring and full of long descriptions. Well I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content and protect their innocence.
1512	4489	2	3	In libraries there are some books, music, magaizines that are not very apporiate to put on shelves. There are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on. They are very mysterious and curious when it comes to that. There are bad books but there are also good books in the library. If people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf or request that the library do so. There are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting. The library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. That way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive to their family's values. Movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies but i dont think that people would find them offensive. They dont have to watch it and neither do their children, as they can simply choose another film. There is a lot of bad music. I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs, alchoal, and violance. People would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see. I have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropiate for underage children. I would get mad too because i dont want an underage child to be listening to that type of music with explicit lyrics. Children now look up to these song writers and want to become them. That is not a good thing at all for their development. All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is. Libraries would not put a inappropiate magazine on the shelves if they are being responsible. There are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read, like National Geographic for Kids. I think that the libraries dont put offensive magazines out because they dont want any controversy or complaints from the community. People today have came out even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropaite for anyone. I think some people today dont realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting those offensive magaizines, movies, books and music. Putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch. The parents dont want their children looking up to a person who is involved in violence or drugs or alchoal. Censorship would be they way to go on all those materials just to keep away contoversy and the children safe from harmful influences.
1513	4490	2	3	Censorship can be considered as a major problem in a free society. I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch. Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend used to control the population. Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong and goes against our principles. First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone. I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today; it is often just differing personal tastes. So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral. Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored. My opinion may differ from another person's and their opinion may be way different from someone elses. If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves, but they should not impose their view on everyone. Others may find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting. Lastly, censorship is a communist trend. Last I checked, the United States is a democracy founded on free speech. So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race. So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere in our public institutions. It is a very communist thing to do and it has no place here. It infringes our rights to free thought and expression. Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored in a fair way.
1514	4491	2	3	Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in ancient Rome when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the Catholic church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the Dark Ages, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items? The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over PG-13 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out R rated movies or parental advisory CDs without a guardian's permission. Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of three hundred pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents through proper guidance. So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur by supporting censorship.
1515	4492	2	3	Every we go there is censorship in some form or another. Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them without understanding. Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do, but they also need to learn through experience. It should be up to the children what they read as they grow and learn. Books should be censored if they are made specifically for children, with their age group in mind. Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like without restriction. Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also, and shielding them completely can be counterproductive. We can learn something from any thing we read, even if it is what not to do. There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can reveal about history and life. When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic because it feels forbidden. If they read themselves they would learn alot more about the world around them. If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life that are necessary for navigating adulthood. It is very unnecessary to have rated R movies available to children without supervision. Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see every second. The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent, not a government body. I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines that objectify people. These photos can give children negative thought, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model, leading to poor self-esteem. Children remember almost everthing they hear/see, so the images have a lasting impact. Ultimately, it should be up to the children what they read as they develop their own judgment.
1516	4493	2	3	One day last week, my dad was pulled over three times for driving while black. This is just one of several quotes from a book that I am reading that some people could take offense to. The book in general is a rather appeasing book, it's just some things, people might take offense to. That doesn't mean the book shouldn't belong on shelves. I don't think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone. That's like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life, you would be left with nothing in the end. If someone finds the things that other people have to say, offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive. Some magazines have really offensive things in them, that people in the real world say. It's not like your generic non-fiction books that come up with insulting things to say, at a high school level. You don't have to subscribe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read. These days, so many things offend so many people, in so many different ways. What might offend my neighbor down the street, another person across town might find funny. You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shelf because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyone's wants and needs. I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books, about age limits. Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as 'young adult' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it's alright for you to read those types of books. It'd be just like movies; movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books? I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, music, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves, and out of market just because someone cried foul against it. If they don't like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no one is forcing them to pay attention to it. They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offensive. Once again I say, taking a book off the shelf every time someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime, you'd be left with nothing.
1517	4494	2	3	Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read may not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea. People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library these days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea. As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that may be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me. For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library just because a few individuals find them disagreeable.
1518	4495	2	3	In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries. Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, CD, magazine, or movie. It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have. If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazine/newspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive. The right to free speech is an important one in the United States, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed. Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who does one think they are to say it's offensive? Who gets to decide that this book or movie is offensive? If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people might find the Bible offensive, but we still put that in libraries, some people might find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all the rage now, we wouldn't take those away. Things that people find offensive are just opinions--just like the ones of those of the writers. It just simply wouldn't work out--if you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that may be 'offensive' material that sparks thought and discussion.
1519	4496	2	3	There are many different kinds of books in the library. Not all of them are for the eyes of every person out there. I think that libraries should censor the books, movies, and magazines so that either they are in a certain room where only adults can see or get them, or they are not in the library at all. The books in the libraries can have some very obscene items in them that young children should not be able to see. I have been to the library many times, whether it be by myself or with others. I know what is out there and some of the books or movies are not always kid rated. I would like to someday be able to take my own child into the library knowing that what they are going to see is okay for their eyes. Magazines are always talking about new relationships or this person is having a baby or anything along those lines, and I don't want my child seeing that. The library I usually go to has the magazines out where everyone can view them and I don't want this for my son or daughter who is of a young age. I think a parent should be able to take their children into a library knowing that when their child runs up to them with a book, it will be something that they are allowed to read or get and not something that an adult would read. Libraries could always make a separate room for books and movies that are not always for children. Such as the rated R movies or books that are inappropriate for young children. That way when a little kid is running around looking for a new book to read, they can't see or pick up these books or movies. I don't know about the other adults or parents out there, but I sure don't want my little kid walking around talking about an inappropriate book or movie they saw at the library. Since libraries have many different kinds of magazines, books, and movies, it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around. Libraries could always make a separate room for items like this. For the books that are for older audiences, movies that are rated R, or magazines such as Cosmopolitan. I think that if libraries did this, parents would be much more at ease to taking their children and letting them run around and look for new and interesting books to read or movies to watch without fear of them encountering inappropriate material.
1520	4497	2	3	There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because something is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove something that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch. First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at what's offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it. Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community. Lastly, let's say that in a library, there's at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library. That's what I think about censorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them simply because of a personal objection.
1521	4498	2	3	Have you ever read or listened to something that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published? Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and inappropriate thoughts that children listen to and base their lives off of. All of these resources that kids can find that have this kind of material in them can be found in public libraries. We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources. A library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place. If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it; they find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library. Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out. Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'. So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book. This leads to disaster and can negatively influence their development. Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded in the past ten years picks up sexual references, drug usage, and inappropriate behavior in its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in their masterpiece? Well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies. So, every artist of any kind of work is putting these references in their books or songs. Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not only sing these lyrics but shows them as well. Children see these artists in these videos with attractive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'. So, this person tries doing the same thing this artist did to make their life more like theirs. Movies come along then, movies have seen the ratings go up on these kind of styles, so they start putting them in their films. Now, all these pieces have this garbage in them and have had it in them for quite some time. How do we get it out? How do we get our children to stop getting these resources? No parents want to walk around and hear their children saying these things or doing these actions. So libraries have to have some censorship on their work; their work should be removed so minors won't get the wrong message. What ever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as something that would get our children into some trouble? We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are.
1522	4499	2	3	I was asked the question 'Do you believe that a certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazine, etc.? should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' I would have to say no. I don't think you should be in the library to be criticizing what other people believe in. But what if you just come past a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive? Just ignore it and move on with your day. I don't think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time. Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and don't bother looking at it. Everything can be offensive to anyone, @PERSON2 was completely right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...Then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this day and age every kid knows more than they're supposed to anyways, so why censor what they already know? What if you might like this specific series and it is about the holocaust and it is like many different story made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but your not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and get it taken off the shelfs cause it's offensive. Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5. If that had happened to you what would you do? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series? Many people find things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't. People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right. If your one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than get upset cause of stupid petty stuff. In music they're are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a different race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being racist. It's not being racist, offending, or directed towards you! So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining. Now Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that, that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading. There are selected magazines and movies out there on shelves of public libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out? I personally don't think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere. Taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading and that is a far greater loss.
1523	4500	2	3	They have a book in the library called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' and if you ever read @CAPS3 you might cry. When they have @CAPS3 in the basement they have him eat off the floor and eat his brothers' throw up and even eat worms. They beat him and tell he has bruises all over his body. His dad broke his arm in two from his dad and mom fighting so much that his brothers can't take @CAPS3 no more so his brother called the cops and the cops came and we all were gone. Two years later him and his brother got adopted. Their new mom and dad were good to them even though they had six brothers and five sisters but they all got along and they had a good life after their real mom and dad died. The story shows a difficult childhood but also a journey toward a better life.
1524	4501	2	3	When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from. There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc. But not all of this is necessarily a good thing. There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience. The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake. Although there is much good items in a library, there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well. For example, an explicit music album. If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile. By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want their children listening to anyway. Movies are also a problem in library's. For example, library's having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch. Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child appropriate. Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie. This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch. So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in library's, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior. Books are the same way as movies and music. There are books on the shelves that some people consider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book. There are books made that include racial material in them, even derogatory statements. By taking these types of books off the shelves of library's, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur. For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in library's should be removed. If library's would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all library's a more healthy and stable environment for studying like it used to be used for. Take out all the offensive material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc. in their place for everyone to enjoy safely.
1525	4502	2	3	What is offensive in libraries? The offenses in libraries are inappropriate and non-censored books, music, magazines, movies, and other materials in libraries. These books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves. They should not be removed because the authors of the books are just writing. From my own experience, I have seen inappropriate movies. To me, I feel that they teach me some lessons, but, it also depends on what type of movie it is. If it is rated @CAPS1 then I know that I @MONTH1 see some blood, gory scenes, and nudity. If this type of movie is not @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then I know that some of this stuff on the screen @MONTH1 happen in real life. Most @MONTH1 not happen, but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world. All of this teaches me to be more careful about what I am doing and where I am doing it at. In libraries, there should not be nudity websites, books, or magazines or anything like that because that is just stupid and inappropriate for any child to see, especially in a public library. Now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it, then it should stay on the shelves. I say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing. So, as I ask again, what @MONTH1 be offensive in libraries? Some @MONTH1 say that books, magazines, movies etc. with racial slurs are offensive; but to others, it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be. In my perspective, I just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and lets the creativeness take over. That @MONTH1 be it, it @MONTH1 not. In so many words, I say that the 'offensive' books, magazines, music, movies and other materials should stay on the shelf. For so many reasons I have said, and the ones I have not said, they help people learn about the world and its complexities.
1526	4503	2	3	Should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment? Of course they should. Libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday, from young children to senior citizens. Certain rated material should be put in certain spots for certain people, such as a designated adults-only section. The library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis, ensuring it is appropriate for its intended audience. Libraries need to become a little more organized in their layout and content management.  Libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday. People of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library, which is a wonderful aspect of public access. With that being said, children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material from the shelves. Children of course can't read everything in the library; they lack the maturity for some subjects. They have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection, such as early readers or young adult fiction. So if the library is more censored and strict about the material, children can't get their hands on the material that they shouldn't be seeing at that time in their lives. You would not want your seven year old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material, right.  Libraries should put the material that is for adults eyes only in one completely different section of the library than what they would want the children that come to the library to see. With doing that it decreases the chances of the children getting a hold of material that they should not see. Also, some books that the library thinks that some children should be able to see just might be offensive to another set of people and they wouldn't want their children to see it. So books that show racism, or maybe another kind of discrimination and it may not be the goal of the book to make that suggestion but it still is in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some childrens minds, shaping their views in a negative way.  The libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment. Libraries have become where children are just checking out books by themselves and to me thats a problem that needs addressing. I think that children need a parents concent to check out a book from a library but do the libraries care, no, they often do not enforce such rules. Library staff may check their inventory and notice a book might be missing but guess what, by that time its already to late for intervention. Children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out properly. When children find a piece of material in a library and they know they aren't suppose to have it and they know they cant get out of the library with it they might decide to just take the book, hiding it in a backpack. The sercurity wont think twice to check the child and what is the result the childs mind is corrupted by the content. Guess what you can blame it on the thought the library allowed this to happen. Isen't that something the child got the material from your friendly neighborhood library, a place meant for learning and good.  Oranization is the key to solving these issues. Libraries need to orginize their material better, plane and simple, with clear signage and sections. It's really not that hard to implement a better system. They need to review the content that thier putting on the shelves in their establishment, perhaps with a review committee. I feel that the people at the library are lazy personally, not taking enough initiative. If they just gave a little more effort maybe the children wouldn't get their hand on material that they have no buisness getting a hold of, like explicit novels. Just pay attention to whats going on in the library, watching the flow of people. Their are books everywhere, right, which can lead to mix-ups. Their are children, correct, who are naturally curious. The children might be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident, left on a table. Though it was an accident it still happened and it can be prevented with more vigilance and it should be prevented for the sake of the children and their development. All we need is a little more organization and care.  As you can see from the following points, libraries just don't about our children as much as we do, focusing more on access than protection. It's okay that everyone is welcome in the library no questions asked but, they people need to stay in the designated place in the library, respecting the boundaries. Children shouldn't be allowed in the adult section for saftey and to prevent exposure. Also a book from the adult side shouldn't be in the childrens section because anything can happen and corruption will rise from early exposure to mature themes. We need stricter libraries with clearer policies. Better sercurity to monitor what they children are looking at and where the material is placed on the shelves. Also the library really needs to look at the material and decide if it is appropriate for all the readers that might look at the material, considering different sensibilities. Organization is the key to all our worries, if we use a bit more effort this won't be a problem anymore and our libraries will be safer for everyone.
1527	4504	2	3	Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some audiences, particularly younger ones. In a culture like the one we have today, censorship usually takes the back seat to freedom of expression and access. The media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad, which can desensitize viewers. People have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides in its founding documents. Every person is titled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries that restricts adult access.  There are many things in libraries today that portray bad images and contain questionable content which some find objectionable. Books and movies have things in them that indeed children shouldn't view, but the library is not able to take them down simply because a few complain. People enjoy seeing and hearing these things, that's why the film industry comes out with more rated R movies than all the other ratings combined, as they are popular. They make the most money off of them, driving production. In today's economy, the library needs to keep these things on their shelf so that they can stay in business and attract patrons. If people are offended by it, then stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie; it is a simple choice. If someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive then they are breaking the freedom that this country has always stood for, imposing their view on others. Censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own for an entire community.  As one can see, the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion or individual preference. It is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want and demand. Books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like, offering valuable lessons through negative examples. Parents should modify what their children watch, monitoring their exposure, but as an adult they are able to watch or read anything that they want to without restriction, which is a fundamental right.
1528	4505	2	3	Hey my name is John and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear regarding library safety. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see due to their mature themes. They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library, away from the children's area.  I had an experince like this once that opened my eyes to the problem. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me to pick out a book. I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him as he looked so eager. He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited to visit the library. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors, full of energy. I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that in a public place. We went inside, it was a giant library with many sections. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read for myself. I found one that looked very interesting, a science fiction novel, I got it and started to read it in a quiet corner. Then my brother ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book he found. He handed it to me and I just lost my composure, the book was not a children book at all; it had a very explicit cover. I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen, with graphic content, we left the library immediately and never came back to that branch.  I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library, clearly marked for adults. This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there, with maybe a staff member nearby. This is what I think sould be done to all libraries to protect young minds from accidental exposure to harmful content, ensuring a safe environment for all patrons.
1529	4506	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years, debated by parents and educators alike. In many school libraries certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed because of the content in them, deemed unsuitable for a learning environment. These items can be removed for these common types of content wich include, use of graphic violence, explicit sexual acts, drug use, and inapropriate language that is not educational. Many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school, who they are with. Most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age, because it could influence them to participate in these activities prematurely, leading to bad choices.  In my opinion I do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups, allowing for self-selection. Inn elementry and middle school libraries, items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inapropriate or violent in anyway, protecting their innocence. In a school environment kids should only be introduced to drug use, and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts in a controlled setting and it would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex, and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie which glamorizes it.  Many kids watch movies that have very violent, and inapropriate scenes, which can be disturbing, and some of the songs in the world today are exstreamly inapropriate for young kids, containing explicit lyrics. Their are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them, this is why I do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing for maintaining an appropriate educational atmosphere and supporting parental values.
1530	4507	2	3	WE ALL DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES, assuming it is all safe. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILDREN GETTING HOLD TO THE CENSORSHIP OF BAD BOOK, MOVIE, MUSIC OR MAGAZINES that can harm them. PARENT DON'T WANT TO COME HOME AN THERE CHILD LEARN A NEW WORD from a vulgar source FROM THE NEW BOOK OR MOVIE HE/SHE JUST CHECKED OUT FROM THE LIBARY, OR READING A MAGAZINE FROM THE LIBARY that contains explicit images. IT MIGHT MAKES YOUR CHILDREN ATTITUDE CHANGE, becoming more defiant, PUTTING BAD INFLEUNCE ON YOUR KID BECAUSE OF A TRIP TO THE LIBARY, which should be a positive place. SO THERE FOR THE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE A SECTION WHERE THEY PICK OUT THERE BOOK from a curated selection AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CHECK OUT THE CENSORSHIP BOOK that is meant for older audiences.  WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN BE MORE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS TOPIC and understand the importance of reading appropriate material, and that libraries implement better systems to guide young readers toward wholesome content that enriches their minds without exposing them to premature adult themes. This careful approach will help ensure that library visits remain a positive and educational experience for all children, supporting their healthy development and aligning with community standards for youth protection.
1531	4508	2	3	I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad. I think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required. In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought, and used in the library. Seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult, or a high school student, their level of reading is not as advanced as ours. Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and any violence. This is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads. It could teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they might think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book. On the other hand, high schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books. I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present. While most guys are into violent books about shooting, or football books, a lot of girls are interested in the romance type of books, that possibly express more then what most kids should know. In high schools, there should be less censory due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in. In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries do have already. This way parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them. Everyone is obligated to their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive, is their choice. All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, because books are a type of out let to people. They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied. Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please. On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books, and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to, and to keep all of their parents happy.
1532	4509	2	3	I think that everyone has their own opinion in what they listen to, what they watch, and what they read. I believe that some stuff can change the world, not from people taking offense, because if we removed everything that someone found offensive, there would be nothing left to sell. Everything is offensive to at least one person. I think they need to get rid of things that cause weak-minded people to do something if they see it, get it in their mind, and then go do it in real life. We should remove the things that can get the weak mind in trouble. I think that we can change what we see or hear and change the world, and that's what the world needs, to change based on what we could not think of before. By carefully considering the impact of media, we can foster a better environment for everyone.
1533	4510	2	3	I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censored can learn a lot from them. Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropriate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed because of their rating I think is lame because they might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch. Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overall I think it should be allowed. Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated R movies then some old movies that are in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most students fall asleep or just don't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administrators to think that we are too immature to watch rated R movies; like every kid at school watches them at home, I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that aren't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. Well then my last point is that all these things help us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week don't let them listen to anything then see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on course to get my work done. So therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. So you have my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated R movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should too; I mean its not like we are in prison, right? So there you have my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools.
1534	4511	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Some say there should be, some do not. Cultural books and magazines could be offensive to some readers. History in books can sometimes even be offensive depending on someone's lifestyle or background. Are you wrong if you say you want censorship in the library? No, you are not wrong because there are many people who think that some books should be taken off of the shelves of their local libraries. Some of their reasons are because parents could have young children and they do not want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable. Others though say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk. Meaning that if someone goes to the library looking for a certain book and they pick up one they find as offensive, it could be a good book for someone else. Do all books that are considered 'offensive' have to be fiction? No, not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive. This does not mean that there aren't books out there like that. Cultural books or magazines from other countries or of a certain topic can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages. Everywhere in the world, no matter where you are, there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you. Everybody has their own opinion on the matter. The cultural materials in the library are just showing how the people of other countries live and act. It is not opinions or false claims in these materials, only fact. So cultural materials should not be censored, although it could have a section just for that type of material. History books can be one of those materials that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in. Religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion. Some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion. Race and origin are another problem with some people. History books and elder's stories can always somehow be mixed and could cause trouble. For example if a World War II veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area; the history book could tell a completely different story. History books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived. My views on the censorship of libraries is that there should not be any of it. Maybe the library could make a section for what people might think is 'offensive.' Materials or books should definitely not be taken off of the shelves though, because one man's offense is another man's great read.
1535	4512	2	3	Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or to even commercials. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. However is that really the right choice? In life, we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equipped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? When one conceals information, that person is stealing the right of knowledge. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another may not. This topic is just too abstract to be regulated. For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us. Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in.
1536	4513	2	3	In our great country we have many freedoms, one of these is the fundamental freedom to read, hear, and see what we want. We all have different views and tastes that go with this freedom such as what we choose to watch on television, what we select to read in our spare time, and what music we prefer to listen to. However, if we had the right to permanently remove things we personally do not like we will inevitably ruin the enjoyment for others. This would eventually remove our collective freedom. Many authors, musicians, and directors have stated that this freedom is essential for having an enjoyable and creative life. We as individuals have different views on many things. Luckily our freedoms allow us to hold these views without intefering with the views or ideas of others. If we systematically removed the books, movies, magazines, etc., that we disliked, there would not be anything left for anyone. Our public libraries would be emptied, the school classrooms would not have educational books, and the retail stores would not have anything to sell. We should not have the right to remove what we think is innapropriate or does not follow our personal values or interests. Even though the right of removing things sounds like a good idea on the surface, we should seriously consider the thoughts and ideas of others. Consider a public library, it has a wide variety of books for children, teens and adults with individual preferences, and a school library with books for children and teens with their own unique preferences on what they like to read. If we allow this right then these libraries which allow and celebrate individuality would not be able to exist. People would be unable to live up to their freedoms of individualty. Everyone should be allowed to be themselves. Imagine what it would be like if we expanded this right to the foods that we buy. We all have different tastes of food that appal and satisfy us. The foods that we choose are a lot like the books we read, there are kinds we favor and others that we would just try to avoid. No one would have any food to eat at a restaurant, at school, or any where else not even at home. It would turn out to be a complete disaster. We should not have this right because it would not be fair to any one. Our views may be different but we have similar needs for choice. The freedom we have is a freedom of choice. If we do not find a certain book, movie, or magazine to be appropriate we should simply choose not to engage with it and allow others to have the chance to pick it up and see if it fits their values and interests. Other people will likely allow us this same chance too. After all, aren't individuality and personal choice what made the freedoms we have so valuable.
1537	4514	2	3	Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view? First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone, as offense is deeply subjective. Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter, creating a new problem. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the primary issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another? Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The Holy Bible' or 'The Quran' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science as we know them. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive. As a solution, I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as 'some might take offensive' or 'material may be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a clear warning. It would be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This may not fix the problem of people being offended completely, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive. In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves may cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves.
1538	4515	2	3	I agree with Katherine's statement, but only to a certain extent. If a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it, then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it. Especially if it's in a middle school or elementary school library where younger children are present. Of course there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it; it is nearly impossible to avoid. One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when I first discovered the Gossip Girl series. But as I got into the books, the more mature they got. In the last book, for instance, it has a lot of profanity in it. But that doesn't mean I'm not mature enough to not know what it means. Same with any other high school student. But you can't protect your children from everything in the world. Not even curse words. So if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things, and you decide you want it removed, just take it to your librarian and comfront him/her. I'm sure they'll understand your concern. Or maybe they won't, and they'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed. My point is, you can't always protect your children from violent words or movies, or magazines. But you can always stand your ground and try to make a change through proper channels.
1539	4516	2	3	What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids? Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately. I disagree in censorshiping in libraries. Instead of censorshiping libraries and removing content, maybe have a special section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them. First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age. Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for identification to confirm that there old enough. This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy. Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop. This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read, leading to reduced funding and resources. I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors. With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book. But it would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy while using other methods to guide children. At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because it would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library. So people that disagree with censorship should act now so libraries can stay how they are now, vibrant and diverse.
1540	4517	2	3	The Censorship on Books. In the world today, everything is showed every place you look, with little filter. Libraries are used by many people, people go there to research, study, and even just to find an interesting book to read. One of the problems that some poeple are having is the exposing of personal or adult things to a general audience. I believe that libraries should have a censorship. Why should libraries have one? Here are my reasons why. One reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children frequently search for books there. Any parent would tell you that they would strongly dislike the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult like without guidance. A library should be a place where children, young adults and senior citizens can go to escape from reality not somewhere were they are worried about what book they might pull out from the shelf. If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock, they should start an age limit on those books. Limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them directly. Another thing they could do with the age limiting is parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books, creating a partnership. Also, another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading, watching and listening to. Parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing and having conversations about media. Cenorships are a wonderful way of stopping the viewing of adult like issues for those who are not ready. More public places should start a system of them. The world needs to understand that some audiences, especially children, aren't ready for harsh reality just yet and need protection.
1541	4518	2	3	libraries across the world contain all kinds of books, some good and some bad. there's always gonna be something in a book that might offend the reader or someone close to the reader. it just depends how sensitive people are. the main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of content involving racial slurs, religion, and sexual themes. i think it should be the library's choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down. other materials like magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music. according to some, libraries are just trashed with vulgar, racial, or bad movies, books, etc. if the parents are scared of their children being able to rent these things, they need to put some sort of block on them. if you want to rent materials deemed inappropriate, you should have to have parental permission. taking all of these things out of the library is not a solution. all it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more conflict. the library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids won't be able to get the 'bad' books in their hands. a lot of the books in libraries have meaning even if the book uses foul language or hate etc. it shows the mood of the story or how the character really feels inside. if stories like 'The Catcher in The Rye' didn't have anger, emotion, or the passion it has it would be a boring book. authors put language, sexual content, and violence in books, movies, and magazines to entertain certain crowds. if you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things they could possibly read. Ultimately, a balanced approach that allows for access while providing guidance is the most sensible path forward for public libraries.
1542	4519	2	3	Imagine a day where there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminiscing of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive. Everyone's ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply. Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. Just don't read it! By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best. A parent could be offended by a fashion magazine in the library that simply has an advertisement for a body wash. She might say something like 'my child shouldn't see things like this,' then demand it be taken out of the library. Does that make sense? I didn't think so either. In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power. Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily! Now, that's only on a small scale. Imagine if they actually took this up with higher authorities. That book would be taken away from all schools in the district. This brings us to this problem. Should we, as people, as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read? The answer to that is a definite no. Let's look on the other end of this now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned? As an example, I'll use J.K. Rowling. What would happen to her if the series 'Harry Potter' were banned from schools? Also, what about the kids that like to read? This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it. That librarian from the beginning is leaving now, there's no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore. The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper. This shouldn't happen. Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody by imposing their personal views on the entire community.
1543	4520	2	3	Censorship is a complex issue. Should certain materials (books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is. If it is something very provocative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it, then it shouldn't be allowed. Or, the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to. It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who have access to these materials. I don't think these materials should be removed, but restricted. Some of it should be left up to the school or library, but it is also a responsibility of the parents. If a child has permission to access a certain material, then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate. Sometimes the guardian's views may not be the same as a the library or schools, but it's mostly up to the guardian. Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence. Over all, I don't think materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents, teachers and/or school board members, and/or library staff. Just because one mom thinks a book is inappropriate for her child, doesn't mean it should be banned from another. Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable, therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person. If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material, then simply don't let them access it. If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access, you can express that, but others may not agree. Materials considered inappropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them, but not a ban, as this preserves access while acknowledging different comfort levels.
1544	4521	2	3	If you found a movie that you really enjoyed at the library, would you get mad if the library just took it away and there was no other place to get it? If one person doesn't like something they see at the library doesn't mean its not educational, and just get rid of it. Just because somebody doesn't like the one thing doesn't mean another person will. I don't think they should get rid of movies, music, books, or magazines just because of one person. Here is somethings that will make you think about getting rid of all these categories. One thing about movies that I like are they are good for visual aids. some people are better learners if they visualize something, they can get a better understanding of the purpose or the cause of the situation and they might learn faster. Another thing about movies in the library are becasue they show you things in the movie that you wouldn't be able to see if you were just reading a book. One thing that i like personally is that when people are in movies its like you are actually talking to me like me and the actor are really having a conversation. When you look at movie it gives you a visual picture of whats going on, even if the content isn't appropriate. Thats all the reasons why i think that movies shouldn't be taken away because someone thinks that the movies are vulgar and not censored. Music is another rule that they shouldn't get rid of. Music is almost the only thing you can use to calm you down so that you can focus again. Another thing that music does to you, is it soothes the mind so that you can relax and you won't bother anybody else. When you listen to music , it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from. so those are the reasons why music shouldn't be rid of. Magazine and books are the basics of a library. If you get rid of those, then it wouldn't be a library anymore. books are the basic learning methods of education. People learn the most information out of a book or magazine. If you take those away its like your trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books. So if you get rid of magazines and books then it wouldn't even be a library any more. if you get rid of movies from the library then people won't be able to have a visual aid as their alternative way of learning. If you get rid of music from the library, you won't be able to concentrate as well on one thing if your constantly getting disturbed by other noise around you. Last but not least if you get rid of books from the library then it wouldn't be a library anymore it will just be a place to go like any other place. The library wouldn't be anything any more. Now would you want that? thank you for considering the value of these diverse materials.
1545	4522	2	3	I'm a lot of things but i am surely not a reader. But i do believe that you should be able to publish anything that you want over any topic. weather that be a graphic novel or a dirty magazine. nothing should be taken off the shelf for being offensive; if it offends you don't pick it up or much less read it. Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, i would still be able to write it and sell it. anything that anyone has a problem with they try to ban or get rid of it. instead why don't they just get over it? we have rights; every individual person from me to you we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full extent of what they can be used for. Call me old fashioned but, I believe in freedom of speech and the freedoms that we have lost soldiers over and the freedoms we have every single day we live. I think drinking every day of the week is wrong but, you don't see me on the news yelling about it no i deal with it just like people should deal with the things they don't like. so i hope in this essay ive made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not act on something you shouldn't be able to change, thank you for taking the time to read this and consider the importance of our fundamental freedoms.
1546	4523	2	3	Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries. One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other, more peaceful solutions to a problem. One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie 'The Ring', and her costume resembled the ghost girl from the film. Some students in the classroom at the time called 911, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher. Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it, leading to premature exposure to adult themes. After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children, who are not yet equipped to process such content. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people and its removal is a necessary step for public safety and well-being.
1547	4524	2	3	Libraries have all kinds of books. Books for everyone, catering to a vast spectrum of interests and tastes. I think libraries shouldn't have to take books out because some people dont like it, or find it offensive, when others might like the author and their work. If there is a book in the library that you find displeasin simpley don't cheak it out just put it back on the shelf and go on with your day. Like author Katherine Paterson said if we start taking book off the shelvies then there willn't be any books left to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not ment for little kids and some adults, but that's why you dont let them cheak them out till you think they are old enough. Just because you dont like the book doesn't mean noone else likes it. Everyone has there own tast in reading, as everything else. Libraries have sections for all ages. With books for there age. Like the childern's section is for little kid, and the adult section is for adults. Little kids shouldn't be cheaking out books from the adult section. Parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what they'r doing, guiding them towards age-appropriate selections. Then we wouldn't have to worrie about what they are reading, watching, or listening to. The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will for years to come. So no libraries shuold have to take sertain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it, or want there kid reading it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits you'r liking. People learn alot from books, so if we get rid of most of them what will we lear from then? Books are a great part of history. Why get rid of you'r history? It's just wrong. Books shouold stay right where they are and belong, preserving the diversity of thought and expression for all.
1548	4525	2	3	Libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between. Their are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader. There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf. The books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book, which could be meaningful to them. Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you? No, you wouldn't get it again, but you wouldn't demand its removal from the menu for others. So why'd someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended it isn't right your views on something are only an opinion nothing more. Your views are not the same as Mr. Johnson's who lives down the street so by removing a book it is pushing your views on somone else, imposing a personal standard on the entire community. In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it. Pushy people aren't normally liked by others. Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader, not censored based on individual sensibilities. That is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf and deny others access to its content.
1549	4526	2	3	Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people sometimes find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem, i have only been to the library around five times i generally rent movies. there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music, but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing. I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines. Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull, it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children. Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson, The Beatles, and slow jams like R-Kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelfs but i do believe that you should have to be a certain age to acess these things, ensuring that mature content is available responsibly without being removed entirely.
1550	4527	2	3	Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways. As an American, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives. The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering summer day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that summer and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared me very much so. Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library. I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries to protect their innocence.
1551	4528	2	3	Every day, hundreds of people visit your local library. The library offers an array of things such as books, music, movies, magazines, and newspapers, but what 'limits' does the library have about the content of those things? All sorts of people go to the library. I go to the library, you go to the library, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings, we all go to the library at one time in our life. Different crowds of people have different interests that may offend others. The question is, should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries? Limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them. Truth is, someone, somewhere is going to take offense to the items in most libraries; you can never please everyone. Also, some of these topics could be used for educational purposes. Take anatomy books for example. While high school and college students use these books and diagrams to study, some mothers may find them inappropriate for their young children to see. This is why libraries have separate sections for different audiences. There could be a children's section, a 'tween' section, and an adult section to help with this issue. Also, everyone has different interests. I, personally, can not stand rap music but my sister loves it. Even though I find some of the things they say in those songs offensive it is my choice to listen to it or not. The song writers, singers, publishers, and authors who write this material have the freedom to do so. Who are we to tell them they can't write about sex, drugs, or murder because, face it, those things are part of our day to day lives. If children aren't seeing these things in libraries, they will eventually come across them elsewhere. Should we remove 'offensive' material from libraries? No. If we do that there will be no books to read, no movies to watch or music to listen to because everyone will take offense to something, and the library's purpose would be defeated.
1552	4529	2	3	Dear Newspaper Editors, the article that you wrote last week really got to me. The one about whether you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. I went back and forth on this, first I was thinking that if it was offensive to some people then we should take it down because if it offends people then why are we selling it to the people, but then I got to thinking again and I was like people have the right to freedom of speech and if this is how they want to talk then let them speak their mind. This great country of ours was made on the right that everyone is created equal and everyone is entitled to the freedom of speech. If people want to talk like they do in their music or act the way they want to in their movies it's their life; if you don't like it don't buy it or even pay attention to it. Say if I was a rapper like Lil Wayne or someone like that I wouldn't care about the people who are talking about the way they are because it is my way of telling the world how I feel about things that are on my mind. If someone writes something in a book that you don't like don't go all out and go on TV shows to make fun or tell how you feel; write a letter to the author and tell them how you feel about the topic. Every person black, white, yellow, brown, or even green has the right to freedom of speech. It was given to us for a reason and I think it was for that, even if you have an idea but you think it is stupid just say it because some people might think that is amazing or not. But everyone is created the same so treat people the way you want to be treated. I would like to thank you for reading this. Your article really opened my eyes to the world and how I should see it. Thank you for writing it and for allowing me to share my perspective on this important matter.
1553	4530	2	3	I think that this kind of books they maybe sometimes offend some people, that depending of what kind or type of book, magazine, movie, music you don't want to see there, and I agree and not agree on this because they are some type of things that are not bad for kids like games for their age or music that are appropriate for their age and others like animals, cultures and all that things. But the only thing that I am not agree is that they can not be books, music, magazines, or even movies that have sexual harassment; that type of stuff should not go into a library. I think that that type of stuff can be dangerous or offensive for some parents and people that have or don't have kids and I think if they are in some libraries that I agree that they need to take that off because I don't want or people want that kids be disrespectful and learn that type of things that they don't go with their education and with their age. I disagree too that this type of music that some artist are making that they are talking about drugs, gangs and narcotraffic and even sex, and I know this because sometimes I hear this on the radio that they are singing and this influence to kids to have another directions on their life and us like parents we don't want that for our kids, we don't want that for their future, we want that they have a good future and be successful and give them the same example to their kids to when they grow up and be a parent too and they are going to see what we are talking about. I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing other innocent persons for this type of things, more for drugs that they are selling drugs and they are doing money that they are hurting other people or kids that consume this drugs that maybe can be our kids or some friends kid and sometimes if they don't pay that money that they need to pay they kill them or that police are trying to find them because are doing bad things and I hope that artist, or people that put this on the libraries think first that maybe they are doing something wrong or stuff that they are thinking that are doing something good, but it is not.
1554	4531	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a major problem in our communities. The question is, 'Should we have an age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, 'Why did they let my child check that out?' These are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them. In my opinion, books should have an age limit on them. My reasoning is because kids under a certain age should have a place where they can find good books for their age group. There are plenty of books out there for all age groups. A young child should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behavior from the character, or artist. Another reason libraries should have an age limit on things you can check out is because kids can get the wrong idea. Let's say a book has a statement in it that describes underage drinking. This would be something that a child should not be able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing. The age limits for book shelves should be clearly defined and separated. Organizing the books in these age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that organizing books in these age groups will stop the commotion. Censorship is a major problem in our communities. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have an age limit on what people can check out?' and 'Why did they let my child check that out?' will be answered. Age groups on books is a great idea that balances access with appropriate content for all.
1555	4532	2	3	There are books up and down the shelves in the library that may make people wonder why they are up there. People might stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves, 'Why in the world is this book here?' What many people may not know is that every book is in the world for a reason. Books published are in the world to teach about history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take you on an adventure. Of course you may come across a book that might be offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it is there for a reason. I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery. It was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner. Now some people would have been very offended by this book, because the characters were calling the slaves all those names that they do not like to be called. But that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people. People can go to any library, from one in an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book about difficult historical topics. Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books, because nobody liked what happened, but they have to be there because of history. People can not just take the books out because it offends so many people. That would be like taking the difficult parts out of history, and that just can not happen. If it happened, it happened, and people have to know. Whether people admit it or not, they have ran into at least one book that has offended them. That will happen, it is almost natural for it to happen. But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf. Those people know that books teach us, and we need books to know what is possible, what happened, and what might happen. Books are here for a reason, and they need to stay on the shelves to fulfill their purpose.
1556	4533	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed if they are offensive to others because libraries have their own rights to have what they want on their shelves. Yes, you might say that some things are inappropriate for children to see, but there is a children's section in every library so that children would not have to see inappropriate things. I feel as though that no one has the right to tell another store or library where to locate their items. Also, I can understand where the author is coming from, but you would have to understand there are people out there in the community that would like to read or listen to inappropriate things that a parent would not allow their children to see or listen to. I would also consider that parents should not let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despicable material. Everyone has their own personal right to place their things where they want them to be. There are many other options; parents can order their books online or go to the library with their child. When I was a young girl my mom never let me go anywhere alone, so I never had to worry about seeing anything inappropriate or offensive. Nowadays, children often know right from wrong. Children generally know what they are supposed to read and what they are not. I do also agree that if a librarian or an adult sees or hears children looking or listening to something they know they should not be, they should stop the child or confiscate the material from them. So no, I do not agree with you. I still think that people should have the right to place their things where they want because it is their stuff and their property.
1557	4534	2	3	Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf. If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left! If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it. Other people might like reading about that topic, or like that kind of music. I understand that some books can be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense. Books about slavery might be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or might even need that information for a research project. There are also many books on the Holocaust, some people might find that offensive, or might not want their kids reading about that, but that is history. It's a time period in the past and it might be something a high school student is doing a research paper over. I have done a research paper over the Holocaust and I have read some very mature material that younger kids probably should not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the Holocaust off of the shelves at our local library. There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people do like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic. If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about. Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact.
1558	4535	2	3	The books, magazines, music, and movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves. They still have good information that someone other than you may want to know. If you take them off of the shelves the people that want to use them don't have the opportunity. If you remove books then if someone needs one for a research paper that they have to do they will not have the necessary resources to do the paper, and at the same time the person with the paper might feel that the non-educational books need to come off the shelves and then that person won't have the books that they want. If they want the book taken off of the shelf, because of inappropriate language or nudity then the libraries can make a spot that you have to be a certain age to access them. I was at the library and there was a woman getting upset, because her son had a movie and book that she didn't think was good for him to have. The book and the movie that he had were in a different area so that minors weren't supposed to get them. So the woman would be the one that would probably want to take them off of the shelves, but it wasn't the libraries fault that he wasn't where he was supposed to be. The products should stay on the shelves, because someone needs it for something or it wouldn't have been there in the first place. If they take the products down that certain people don't like then the people that do like it will not have it. If there are reasons that people must have the product off of a shelf then the product should go somewhere else that can be accessed by the people that do want to use the products. The products should stay on the shelves so that the people who need, or just want to use the products can use the products.
1559	4536	2	3	To the School Board: Censorship, does it deserve a place in our society? There has been much controversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where I stand on the situation. It seems as though every time we cross over this bridge, the issue of censorship comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must perform proper etiquette and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things. My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for three and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'. All other material, whether it be a rapper rapping or an author writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with the content. Great artists, for example, he always has a message in his music, whether it be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when his song is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message that's coming across. Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? It's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debatable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time. A student to the Board, from our town.
1560	4537	2	3	Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library? Several people would agree, but I disagree. Growing up, a certain pop star was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and upbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some parents restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of their freedom. You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite artist, movies, or reading material though because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track. Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time management skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set. Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material all together. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop their own opinions and likings of the different types of media.
1561	4538	2	3	Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1? Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavor? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive. I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should consider the psychological effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over @CAPS1 rating movie. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life. You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading! It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them. Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries, a safe and designated area. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in. It should be colorful and playful as possible. I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brung a movie to watch, when @CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and @ORGANIZATION1 me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep, hoping she didn't have any nightmares. Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children.
1562	4539	2	3	Everyone is @CAPS1. Every @CAPS2 person is @CAPS1, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are @CAPS1 so we all have @CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good. When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If I picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a @CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive. Yet if i gave that same book to a @CAPS3, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the @CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all. It all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they @MONTH1 feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly @CAPS1. Everyone is @CAPS1 and feels diferently about issuses. There is no way to make sure that @CAPS2 book in the library won't offend a single person. The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. No matter what we do, some one will be offended. For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we @MONTH1 find offensive. In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive. So why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending people. For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries.
1563	4540	2	3	Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. They are all somehow offensive to certain people, but not to all. Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds. I believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye. When a book is banned, a piece of history is removed from others' sight. A book that @MONTH1 have been banned in the @DATE1 could not have been read by my mother or father. My future children and I could also never be able to read it. Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content. When I was about eight years old, I remember seeing on the news that people in @LOCATION1 and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 countries were burning books from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series, only because it contained magic and ridiculous fiction. Maybe they were being burned because the @CAPS5 looked down upon its story and its fictional stories, but that does not mean it should be banned from the libraries. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series is one of the most popular pieces of literature of my generation, and generations after mine should be able to enjoy it as much as we did. Before the beginning of @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the @CAPS11 were starting to be discriminated against. They were treated as sub-humans, like in this example. There was a night in @DATE2 called @CAPS12, when radical @CAPS13 and @CAPS14 supporters burned @CAPS11' houses, stores, and even books. Some of those books could have been the only copies, yet the @ORGANIZATION1 let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of @CAPS16 literature. Because the @ORGANIZATION1 found the @CAPS16 work offensive, the generations after @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 can never read the books burned during @CAPS12. In Katherine Paterson's quote, she says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe she is correct in this quote. If literature keeps being censored, there will be none left for future generations to enjoy. No literature should be censored, not even the most radical, magical, or fictional. If censorship continues, the future of literature is doomed.
1564	4541	2	3	There are many works out in modern times which can be considered provacative or offensive. Some are even unfit for young eyes. There are many reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I believe that no one, politician or artist alike, should have the right to put down someone else's work. There are definitely books in libraries that wouldn't be dreamt of being checked out by the ordinary person, but these books should not be put down. I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs, and elbow grease should be removed from public. No matter how offensive or wrong some @MONTH1 be, it is their work and their time, and their heart and soul which they put into a book. It is the truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still disagree. For example, even today @PERSON1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is illegal to even have in @LOCATION1. This is for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one at that, but I believe that this book should still be available so people can read and learn from the past. As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well. This is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS3 @NUM1. This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the @DATE1's, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society, and was even censored itself for a long time. Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power. There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea. That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike. If one removes these from society in any form, then at a raw standpoint, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society. If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself. Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs.There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries. Censorship, as a whole, is a helpful process for the benefit of the public, but all in all it removes the ability to see the raw, cold truths of life. This keeps some from ever learning how to be safe truly, and how to think and believe in their ideals. When politicians step into the boundary of art, music, literature, and even education to an extent, and try to keep it from flourishing as it naturally would, then something must be done. I'm not inciting a rebellion, but I truly do not believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man. That in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its concern and connection with the world.
1565	4542	2	3	Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what. I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read. In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children. I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a @NUM1 movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment. Libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article. So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.
1566	4543	2	3	People @MONTH1 have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @CAPS1, etc. Whether those reasons be personal or professional it is rather important. Some @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself, perhaps due to conflicting personal values. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation, fearing its influence. And writing or music could be thought of as unneccessary and irrelevant to the community's standards. The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout; offense is subjective. Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song, a single word or an entire concept. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing, exercising personal discretion. Unless the offender is very public and offends pratically everyone, should it then be removed from public access. Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened otherwise. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand, encouraging illegal acts. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it, not necessarily the material's intent. Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a @CAPS2 and they singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unneccessary and harmful. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable, promoting division. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story, that is a form of defamation. In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people. Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started, such as inciting violence. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed, to prevent harm. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access to uphold dignity.
1567	4544	2	3	My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways so why take @CAPS3 off the shelfs ? No I don't think any adult material should be cencered . You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take @CAPS3 from them and say '@CAPS1 your eyes can't handle that content yet.' @CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and @CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal ? It is a natural part of growing up. If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 . I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having @CAPS3 when they got older . So don't disaplin your children for @CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better . I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need @CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion on the matter. Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them . @CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did @CAPS1 wrong , @CAPS3's the parents fault for not securing it. Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need for fulfillment. So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one when they find it. No , a library can have whatever they want , @CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay. As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is @CAPS1 we don't need more of in this world.
1568	4545	2	3	The question was asked 'Do you believe certian matierals, such as books, music, movies, moagazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive,' No! By taking away these things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the self, that @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' your taking away things that people enjoy and find value in. Not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these, as it restricts freedom. So should we do this, I dont believe that we should. There are many reasons that this should not be passed and considered. First by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these such items, as they shop elsewhere. Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store and their livelihood. A lot of people like things that dont have any limits to them, enjoying creative freedom. They often find their joy in these things, a source of entertainment. I know that i, myself like reading books, listening to music that has no limits, exploring new ideas. So if your taking them away or puting limits to it, are people really gonna want to have these things? Probably not. Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc, that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc, in catogories based on content. These catorgories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading, creating a simple system. Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan to address concerns. Finally, as katherine paterson stated 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self.' If this is really a problem then the the parents need to watch what their child is reading, because it isn't right to have everything taken away from the society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading; parental guidance is key. So what do you think, should this be such a law. The choice is yours to make. Just remember though, if you agree with this then consider the impact. Just think of everything you are taking away from other people, do you really want to be that heartless and restrictive?
1569	4546	2	3	Censorship is a matter of great contention today, debated in many forums. Many authority figures have seemingly become obsessed with the notion that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation, blaming media for societal ills. Many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright, shielding them from harm. However, I believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part, a misguided effort. Denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them ignorant, not innocent; so many books today are censored, and yet the information contained in them could have been vital to children who are seeking an understanding of the world they live in, leaving them unprepared. One of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not, a line hard to draw. Books that are viewed as offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as being offensive is just that, a view, a personal perspective. It changes from person to person because of varying cultures, religions, and moral codes, making consensus impossible. No one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf, a subjective judgment. The problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable, lost to readers. Censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing, but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge and critical thinking skills. Children should be encouraged to read and to learn, not blocked from doing so, fostering curiosity. Yet if this is truly the case, why does the censorship debate still rage on in society? The argument continues because, in truth, there really are things that ought to be censored, a difficult admission. Movies, music, and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths, influencing behavior. Bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children, fostering aggression. But that cannot be the sole cause of such behavior; children will act right if they are taught how, not if they are hidden away from every instance of wrong, education is paramount. Censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect, which have a lasting effect. Inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice in many places. But try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it, the loss you would have felt. Do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them and shape their future?
1570	4547	2	3	I do believe that we can have Materials because there are some good materianls thats have some good stuff in that, providing value. Book yes if we don't have no book we can't leave, as they are essential for knowledge. If we don't have book how we people know how to read and learn new things? Music i will said yes and no because some time music is not good with bad messages but some time people need music to do they work and feel motivated. I will say know to magazines because it be to much in that, too much inappropriate content. It be stuff thin them that @CAPS1 sould not see, material that is not suitable for their age. Therefore, a balanced approach is needed for different types of media.
1571	4548	2	3	No, I don't think that certain books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves. If stuff like that gets taken off, then there will be nothing good to read; the books now days are starting to get good, so if they take the good books then no one will read. Most people think that rap music is bad, but that is the music that most people listen to now days, and most people don't like country. There are some bad movies out there, but they are fun to watch because they are either funny, gross, or they are sad; but those bad movies are gross or funny. If people made better magazines, then they wouldn't have that much money, and then that business will go out of business. That is not a good thing because the person that runs the business will have no money to feed his kids. Since I have been alive, most of the good things like books, music, and magazines have changed because people don't like the stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again, then people will stop going to the movies and buying books, so that is what I think. Now there are a lot of good movies and music coming out, so if they brought back all the stuff they used to have, then people would have more money. The reason people would have more money is because more people would go see the movies from back in the old days. So, movies like from the past and even older classics would make a lot more money. So that is why I think they should not take stuff off, because that is how we are losing all our money. The people are using the money that they would use for movies or books and stuff, and they are using it for drugs and other stuff that can get them sent to jail. This is why keeping these materials available is important for everyone.
1572	4549	2	3	What I believe is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes an author to write a book is very long; it could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away? Every person has an opinion, which they are allowed to have by freedom. Material in libraries is sorted by age group, and as long as the material is fitted for that age group, there shouldn't be a problem. There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person. There are many opinions in the world; that is why there are so many different kinds of books. If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that help a child? Yes, it could have bad words or beliefs, but it could help someone. If a person is a loner or just likes to be by themselves, they could learn from the character's mistakes in the book. Many children these days are getting bullied or picked on and don't want to tell an adult. If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher. Yes, I agree, every material has something in it that another person does not like. There are a couple books that I did not approve of myself, but I know that it has connected with a child somewhere in the world. Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them. You should stop and think: if you were a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash? Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there are negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family; all they care about is their own family. Even the author's family is embarrassed by the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel. Think about your opinion; does anyone care about what you think? That is why, as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like it if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trash? If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge; would you want someone judging your belief or opinion? We must respect the diversity of thought and expression that books represent.
1573	4550	2	3	A lot of things can be found offensive nowadays, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own view and opinion on things. For the things people find offensive, I believe they should just simply stay away from it. No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Some things people might find offensive, others might enjoy. It's simple; if it comes to the point where people are causing problems, then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there might be a lot of things that people take offensive, but that does not mean take away the things others might enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly, in my eyes, it's simple: if there is something you find offensive, just stay away from it, because others might enjoy it. It's not up to me whether the materials should be removed from the library shelves, although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions, and ultimately, personal choice should guide what we consume.
1574	4551	2	3	This essay is about censorship for the libraries; well, there shouldn't be any because a lot of this stuff is on TV like Comedy Central, various channels, MTV, and a lot of channels. Should music be censored? No, because the blanks can ruin the beats, rhythm, and the lyrics. The censorship ruins how the song goes, and it makes people mad because they like a certain song, but if they want to listen to it, they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it are numerous and include popular streaming services, and a lot more. Movies shouldn't either; it's the parents' pick. If they didn't want the kids to watch or hear the things they do, don't pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms. Books!!! should not, I repeat, should not be censored because what if the adults want to read them? That ain't fair for them cause all of this is about kids. Kids are smart about this; they know what to read and what they shouldn't read. T.V. shows are the best thing ever; there are a lot of shows that are funny, awesome, thriller, and a lot more. But it gets to you. Here is an example: various channels play a lot of good movies, but since they have to block out the words and parts of the movie, it really doesn't make sense to watch it because there are parts they really haven't seen, and they have to go rent it or buy it to see the movie. Am I right? All I am saying is that censorship ruins a lot of TV shows, movies, and music, and nobody wants that. It ruins the entertainment for people, and that is sad to see because actors, music writers, writers, and a lot more spent a lot of their time for the fans and work when they could be with their families!!! Well, this is the end of my essay, and I believe censorship ultimately harms the creative work meant for our enjoyment.
1575	4552	2	3	There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue. On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is appropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them. Like movies, there are ratings which mean that you should be a certain age or older to view it, or parental guidance is suggested. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music, the cover will have a label that says explicit content. I agree with this. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely necessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item, they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me, and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race, then I agree that it should be taken off the shelves. There are also people out there who are more lenient and others that are more strict. Just like parents, for example. A lot of parents want to raise their kids in an environment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let their kids watch and listen to items out of their age group. Like with me, my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want, and in my opinion, I turned out just fine, while others might not think so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items, and they turned out to be well-behaved adults. Then there are also people who had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vice versa. That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary, I guess I could say that everyone has their own opinions and views, and a system of ratings and personal responsibility is the best approach.
1576	4553	2	3	Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be clearly marked saying that they might be found offensive. From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore, but I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do. Have you ever read the book The Lord of the Flies? If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people might try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful piece of literature. As you may have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and the book has remained in schools. The law hasnt passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people may not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed. Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people might find the books offensive while others might not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling. The book may only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section. I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands. Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive.
1577	4554	2	3	In a diverse community, everyone wants censorship. Mainly because they dont want be the outcast. Thats understandable in the case that we have numerous amount of different races in our town. In some ways, censorship is necessary and in other ways, some people just want attention. If all different races want censorship, then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people? Essentially, the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction. For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, that might be insulting to another group of people. then that group of people wouoldn't like a reference to another book, which another group of people dislike, and it goes on and on. So for the censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be some tolerance and understanding. On the other hand, young children are in need of censorship. They grow and mature everyday, developing physically and mentally. So if we were to put an inapropriate book in front of them, they would read it and accept is as standard. And when they read bad things like that, they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives, which could lead them down a harmful path. We are all different, and interpret things in different ways. So when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong, someone right around the corner might think that its just normal. If you question someones movie or song, in the scheme of things, your questioning their judgement, and thats unfair to them and their personal freedoms.
1578	4555	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and study, something that everyone should have access too. If someone is offended by one of these things i do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements. Many people will still find these books or other recources interesting and valuable. If the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so, allowing for personal choice. Radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs and violence but i believe that kids need to be associated with these things in a controlled manner. Parents can't keep their children from it all of there life, and most of the bad things said are cut out or edited for broader audiences. Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes. So why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person when it could be meaningful to another? The key is to provide access while allowing individuals to make their own informed choices about what they consume.
1579	4556	2	3	I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want. People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. Take the book, Lolita in the adult fiction section, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that, but it is important for literary study. Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them and enjoy their preferred entertainment. Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. Just imagine watching a popular comedy and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less. Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it and may find value in it.
1580	4557	2	3	Censorship in media has been around since the beginning of the film industry. Some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries how do they even need to be censored? Censorship of books should be simple: if a book is not for children keep them away from it. Books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library. A library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining to the general public. Music is another thing. Most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section. They should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five? Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today. Maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored. Movies are almost the same as music because it potrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual. Again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear. Libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library. They should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture. Over the years it has become harder to censor magazines. Magazines are impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine. If you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive. The libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines at all if they are too graphic. If you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question for the benefit of all patrons.
1581	4558	2	3	Yes, I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less interest in. Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves to maintain a comfortable environment for all patrons. For example, someone, by accident, could stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. They could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them. That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers and support from the community. Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is children. What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see. But, it does happen. Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. They would most likely do everything they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach. Children definitely do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it. Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. It could be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. And without them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. That could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials, creating a sense of alienation. In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people and disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of a public institution.
1582	4559	2	3	As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books might be offensive to some, but not all. I don't think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyone's preference on books can be different. I believe that libraries should keep uncensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading inappropriate material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriate. People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the other people who use the library. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practically any topic, so reducing the number of books based on one person's opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many people still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering new ideas and perspectives. To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who don't want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone likes different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children won't find books with material in them that they shouldn't be reading. By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they don't want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasn't appropriate for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didn't want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would have been easier in the situation. In conclusion, I don't believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesn't mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read uncensored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section.
1583	4560	2	3	I do not really read books often, but I think that offensive things should be taken off shelves because there could be a scene if they aren't. There are many people who will fight if they are truly offended and it is not a pretty sight to witness in a public place like a library or a store. Such conflicts can disrupt the peaceful environment and create a negative experience for everyone present. Removing materials that are known to cause such strong reactions is a practical step to maintain order and respect among the community. In conclusion, to prevent public disturbances and ensure a harmonious atmosphere, it is better to remove items that have a high potential to offend.
1584	4561	2	3	I believe if I worked at a library, and if I found multiple items that has profanity, racism, or slang, I would agree with taking them off the shelves. This includes Magazines, music books, and other similar media. I wouldn't want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism, etc. I would like to inspire more people to check out library books but you couldn't if there were inappropriate books available for anyone to find. If I worked at a library and I had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults and young children to check out, I would take that duty very seriously. How would it make you feel if I didn't do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home an inappropriate book; how would you respond to it? I would do a thorough observation on all the books that we had in our library to identify any problematic content. I also think that all libraries should have more inspiring books and cartoon and baby books for little children. I think if the majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book, I think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf. Not only would I not want my children to see it, I wouldn't want someone else's children to see it either. This is how I feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book; I wouldn't let he or she go back to the library until they organized their library properly. Lastly I think libraries should have a big room full of little kids books. Also I think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books, another room for young children, and on up. I hope this inspires you to think about what is available in public libraries. Always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the book is going to be about.
1585	4562	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around. As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unacceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deems unacceptable. Everyone has an individual view of what is unacceptable, so that could leave no book to be left on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there. There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government might not see it as something to be censored. This brings up another question, what deems something unacceptable to be viewed? In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material, not the mandate of an authority. The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. The novel, 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' was once censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of American culture, the effect that it had on American literature to this day would have been lost, and a significant piece of our heritage would be absent. I see literature as another form of art. Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. Artists are ones to take risks and so are writers. If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as a risk. Should we have censored them and stifled progress? Another instance under which censorship had had a negative effect on society and culture was during the Nazi regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under Hitler's rule. A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed unacceptable just because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power of picking what is unacceptable into the hands of one group of people? Whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation. The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us. Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature? Nothing stopped them from banning 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' so is there a limit? This is the question one has to ask themselves, to keep the government from potentially cutting the nation off from future masterpieces and limiting our collective understanding.
1586	4563	2	3	There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently. Many books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive by some individuals or groups. There are, however, libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive, upholding a principle of broad access. There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but libraries should not have to censor certain items as a matter of policy. One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie, such as a content advisory. If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label, they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting. Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents, not the library administration. Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting, taking an active role in their development. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they could restrict them from accessing it. If the item doesn't seem too harmful, they could allow it, perhaps as a teaching moment. That decision, however, is up to the parents and their judgment. Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library, a designated area for mature content. Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision, ensuring controlled access. And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents to enter that area with them. There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned from libraries entirely. That sort of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out, balancing access with responsibility.
1587	4564	2	3	Everyone has there own opinions and arguements about something, and this is especially true when it comes to library collections. There are a lot of books that can be offensive to people in some ways, due to language, themes, or ideas. There can be over thousands of books in a library, and I find it difficult sometimes to find that right book that interests me among such a vast selection. My personal opinion is that i do not think that books should be removed from a shelf even though it might offend someone, as offense is subjective. As I stated in the first paragraph, everyone has there own opinions and tastes in literature. There are so many types of books out there from murderes, romance, mysteries, drugs, and many more, covering a wide spectrum of human experience. These books should be placed in seperate areas just as many books are, like fiction and non-fiction sections. If books are taken off a shelf what does that mean to us people? It sets a concerning precedent. Everyone has there own freedom to choose what they read. So if books are going to be moved from someone that's taking away from are individual freedom to access information. There are more to books in a libray also, with various other media available. From books, movies, music, magazine, etc., can all of them have different types of content to them. I do think they should just be placed in different areas according to their intended audience. I can see where people think that this can cause an influence to young children if they pick up something that is disturbing, but they should be with an adult who can guide them. Adults know what is right from wrong than what children do, and can provide context. For example, whenever i walk into public places i hardly every see children just running around especially in libraries, which are structured environments. Libraries are expected to be kept quiet and not out jumping around and screaming, encouraging calm behavior. The kids should be kept with there parent or an adult that way they can't grab something they shouldn't, ensuring appropriate material is selected. I understand that some teenagers can be offended by content related to drugs or killings, in magazines or books, but some people like reading about that kind of stuff for various reasons. Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended? Certainly not. To many think they have the right to do anything without negociating with others or considering different viewpoints. People that do not like that kind of stuff should just put it back down and go on with what they were doing, exercising personal choice.I can understand if you think that restrictions should be put on some things because i will agree that not all content is for all ages. There should be sections for teens, adults, and children to help with navigation. To me that does not mean we have to remove anything though from otheres for offending someone, as removal is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be, offering a space for thought. You should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone, fostering an environment of discovery. Taking away things does not mean your just taking away from one, it means your taking away from everyone who might benefit from it. You can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom by simply choosing not to check out certain items. These are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or anything else, in support of intellectual freedom.
1588	4565	2	3	There are lots and lots of arguments over the censorship of books and how they could affect children, making it a contentious topic. Some people think that offensive books should be removed from library shelves to protect young minds. Others think that they should be left up there for the people who want to read them to do so, valuing access. Some parents of children say that their child has became more offensive towards others after reading certain material, when others people think it is just bad parenting and not the book's fault. So, you see that there are many different statements about offensive stuff being told to their children, with no clear consensus. I think that there are some offensive things that need to be kept on shelves and that there are some that shouldn't, requiring careful judgment. Some articles that are offensive should be left up on shelves because they might teach children of what is bad and what isn't in the real world. Other articles that have no reason for being offensive beyond sensationalism should be taken off shelves. For an example there is music that talks about being extremely harsh and disobedient to others when that person has done nothing harmful, promoting negativity without cause. One example of being offensive in a good way is the book 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' This book showed how bad slavery was and how it should never happen again, using its powerful narrative for a moral purpose. If there is a book or any other piece of material that is offensive in a good way, with a constructive message; I want to read it and understand what it is trying to portray to me, to learn from it. If it is portraying a bad image without any redeeming value, then it should be removed from shelves to uphold community standards. If it isn't portraying a bad image then I believe that it should be taught to children so they can understand the affects and know the difference between what is right and wrong, using it as an educational tool. Books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be thrown away, as they offer no benefit. This is because children that read it could join in on what the book is suggesting, mimicking negative actions. Then that could lead to bad consequeces for that person or someone else for that matter, causing real harm. I have witnessed accounts where someone has listened to bad music or read about something bad and then have been changed by it, but not in a good way, becoming influenced negatively. There has been incidents where that person did something illegal and then had to face the harsh consequences for that action, a sad outcome. Then I have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book, gaining empathy and understanding. I personally have been changed by the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' in a good way, learning about racial injustice. Now I realize how bad that was towards colored people, so I behave nicely to them, since they are just as equal to everyone else, showing the positive power of literature.
1589	4566	2	3	Removing books from the library because they are offensive is a good idea to some, but I do not agree because, the books should not be gone for good from the collection. There should be age limits on books instead of outright removal. Books that are offensive should be only allowed to adults or a certain age group, restricting access by maturity. This will help with children not being scared by content they cannot process, to help keep history around for educational purposes and, to protect freedom of speech for authors. By making an age limit on certain books, we can keep children innocent and pure for a longer time, shielding them from harsh realities. With books such as 'Fifty Shades of Grey', kids seventeen or under should not read that book due to its explicit nature. Seventeen and under are still nieve and impressionable in many ways. Little kids do not know about sex or even pre-marrital sex, and such topics are confusing. With the characters and his girlfriend having sex every other chapter, its very inapporite for a child to read, containing adult themes. Also, with all the torture parts, it would scare a little boy/girl out of his/her mind, causing unnecessary fear. When getting rid of offensive books entirely, we remove important parts of history from access. Think about where we would be if Anne Frank did not write her diary, a vital historical document. We would not know how bad Hitler really was from a personal perspective. We could only assume based on secondhand accounts. With getting rid of books cause they are 'offensive' is a ridiculous reason, as it ignores context. Books are only offensive to senative people, but they can be valuable to others. Books keep history alive by preserving firsthand accounts! Think: 'What are we without history?' We would be a society without lessons from the past. Finally, freedom of speech is why they should stay on the shelves, a fundamental right. Authors have the right to write what they want, expressing their ideas freely. If the reader does not like it and finds it offensive, then they should not read it, exercising personal choice. If Shakespeare, was told he could not write his stories, we would not have the tragety of Romeo and Juliet, a literary masterpiece. So many books would be lost if someone could not write because it was offensive to some, impoverishing our culture. Books that are too offensive or inaporite for a child to read there should be a age limit on it, a practical compromise. If we get rid of certain books we get rid of certain history as well, losing knowledge. Getting rid of those books tells a next coming author that freedom of speech does not matter to offensiveness, creating a chilling effect. So keep the books around, its only words on a page, and let readers decide for themselves.
1590	4567	2	3	Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on public library shelves, advocating for intellectual freedom. They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read by anyone, which is a form of censorship. These books are often known as 'Challenged Books' due to frequent complaints. However, parents, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not, imposing their personal views on the whole community. In the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive by today's standards, including racial slurs. These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel and its historical accuracy. The author is not claiming that she personally feels that African Americans should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as Bob Ewell or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way, reflecting the era's prejudices. The novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, is a great way for people to understand the history of the American South and its racial tensions. Without the authentic descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would be unknown to many, sanitizing the past. The novel, The Catcher in the Rye, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager, capturing his voice. The author, J.D. Salinger, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters to achieve realism. The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school, and their language reflects that. To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters and their development. The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations, which are part of the protagonist's experience. These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries, as other forms of media face similar challenges. Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well for their content. In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them, which is a reasonable concern. It should be remembered that it is the parent's responsibility to censor materials for their children, not the library's duty. Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence in the world and in media. Library patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences entirely, but rather equipped to understand them. In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many to achieve artistic and historical truth. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries based on subjective offensiveness. Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public to encourage a well-rounded collection. If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the parent or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries, placing the choice where it belongs.
1591	4568	2	3	Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain. All literature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion, capable of shaping thoughts and beliefs. So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes. Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves. It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library. No matter how crude a topic may be, it may still be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should be required to obtain these books. A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian. A book not read might as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some individuals feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person may be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left.
1592	4569	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life. Maybe its politics; it could be a sports team. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear. Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased. People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library. For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library. The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read. Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents. To the grandmother, this content is offensive. Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it. It obviously isn't hard to do. So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen to it. If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it. A wise person said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This statement is as true as any statement could be. What would be left? Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive. Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves. Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it? It's just easier to move on and forget it. Ignorance isn't all bad when it preserves access for others.
1593	4570	2	3	Taking books off the shelves will not change anything; children are just going to go to a different place to find the book, perhaps to a book store or other libraries if they like it. If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was good music, book, or magazine, I would get it cause thats what children do: they explore. Books are here to read and to look at; I feel if you know I'm not suppose to read it, make me show proof of age or not give it to me. I really dont understand why some books be in stores and people dont want you reading them. Some children dont read at all and to see them pick up a book, sit down to read should be good enough. But there is always an age group thats not suppose to read some books. But at the same time you cant keep the child away from the world, and what it brings you. The books are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past. I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that another person would not understand. So they feel the song other than what another person would hear, just the beat, the rhythm, the lyrics, and the melody. Thats not what some parents want you to hear. Magazines tells a lot of things and show too much for the younger minds. Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of ten looking at any naked girl or adds about porn in certain books or any of that kind. Parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they knows whats best for you. Whatever they tell you is not wrong cause they have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behind their backs. But if they want learn the easy way, its always the hard way.
1594	4571	2	3	When you go to a library, you may have a lot of choice about reading books, watching movies or listening to music, and sometimes you might encounter offensive words or abusive language that is not appropriate for your children. Students must have the right to request the removal of a book from the library if he or she gets offended, or sometimes if there is a student who has came from a different country and they might get offended by the movies or music that are in the library. Books are most commonly used in the library. In those books, there are some books that are offensive to some students, and if one student finds something offensive, he should have the right to request the removal of the book from the library shelf. Many students like fiction books, which may not be a true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling is racist towards him. School or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life. Music is also one of the important things that is carried in any school library or any public library. Most common type of music that you can find in the library is classical, jazz, or folk music. Most of the times those kinds of music might not carry any bad words, racism or any offensive language, but some of the songs might carry something that is not appropriate for school use. Those kinds of music must be removed from any school library or any public library. Movies are also carried in some libraries, but not every library carries a movie. Some of the movies might have blood scenes or abusive language, which might not be appropriate for some children who are at school. You should check the rating of the movie that you are checking out of the library or if you are watching it at home or any other places. Movies might carry some kind of racism in them. Library is a good source for reading books, listening to music, or watching a movie. While you are reading a book or watching a movie, you might find words which might not be appropriate for yourself or for students who read those books. These movies, books or music can carry abusive language or something that is racist to some people who came from a different country. Student should have the right to remove something that is not appropriate in school use, such as books, music and movies, if they contain something that is not supposed to be in it, you should remove it to maintain a proper environment.
1595	4572	2	3	A lot of people are offended by things that are uncensored. Some people think they should be censored and others think it should not. Its all a matter of opinion. I don't think anything should be censored because it takes away from the freedom of speech, a fundamental right in our society. With censorship one can not fully express themself or their opinion. That is why nothing should be censored, allowing for the full spectrum of ideas and creativity to be shared openly and without restriction.
1596	4573	2	3	I strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelves. Books, magazines, and the rest of the materials are based on the author's and musician's experiences and their observations. With the population of readers in the community, I know that the removal of books for what they might contain would have a bad impact on the people as a whole. The world needs its materials. The writer of the book writes on his observations and his own personal experiences in life. The author puts so much into it; why take it away because someone doesn't like how part of it's worded? Movies that are considered bad probably just have a bad word or a scene where there's a little blood. Lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing. I seriously think some parents think if their kid hears a bad word or sees a little puddle of blood that the kid is going to end up in jail. Then there is music. The public thinks that kids should not be exposed to music like rap and hip-hop. I agree with that, but I also don't see if it's Christian rap or it's a clean song what's wrong with it. A musician is not just paid for his or her amazing skills with an instrument, but also with his or her way to connect with the listener through shared feelings and ideas. I truly don't see any reason to take any form of materials off the shelves. The artist who produces it has a right to their own opinion. The public I feel makes a big deal out of nothing. The smallest problems don't define the material the way the reader hears the work of the artist, and we must protect the right to create and to access diverse forms of expression.
1597	4574	2	3	Where it really becomes a problem is that no one wanted to read; it's too hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine. Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public. We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, television, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best way to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it crosses the line. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come. Censorship may just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it becomes necessary whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. At least the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today. With all of these new music award shows and other reality sitcoms making air on television, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like some cable networks don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other. Books are another thing that could use some censorship. My teacher used to tell me, 'if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it,' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be. With the world today, it is quite easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if you're angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it truly becomes a serious issue that needs our attention.
1598	4575	2	3	Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offensive should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about before deciding if censorship is right or not. What is too offensive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past? If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound to repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities. If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts some creativity and sense of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now may have never been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someone's thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world. People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, because someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offensive can help in many ways. All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come, which is why we must protect our access to all of them.
1599	4576	2	3	Libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials. Within those books, magazines, and movies holds much knowledge, information in the non-fiction selection, and many entertaining and good morals in the fiction selection of books. If libraries began censoring their books, much information will be disclosed for no one in the public to read. The government could have multiple reasons as to why they feel certain books should be taken off the shelf. Some possible reasons could be they are racist, send the wrong message to children, or spread knowledge the government wants to keep away from the common man. Censoring books would be a horrible idea and affect everyone. Some books that could easily be considered to be taken off the shelf would be books that are racist, or suggest radical ideas. Everyone in the world is deemed equal and books which suggest one race is better than another could offend the readers and for which the government decides to have it taken off the shelf. Books that suggest radical ideas could also belong in the group of books being taken off the shelf. The government could be worried that the reader might carry out this radical/terrorist idea and would in return censor them. But censoring these ideas would be denying the public their chance to learn; there are racists everywhere and just because you simply toss the book away, won't suddenly rid the world of racists. Another cause why books or magazines might be removed from the shelves could be that they send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content. Parents try the best they can to repel the content away from their children, and books they begin to read whether it be on their own or in school could introduce kids of all ages to new content, their parents may not prefer them learning at their age. Parents may have a point, but children can not be protected from everything; they must learn and accept certain ideas as they grow and develop. Parents should be able to censor what their children read in their own home, but to take the books or movies entirely off the shelf would prevent the people, who enjoy or see comedy in these articles, movies, music, or books, to learn acquire knowledge, even if their only purpose of reading is just for laughs. Censoring might also be introduced into libraries because the government does not want the public learning and developing ideas on what they think the right idea of doing something is that the government disagrees with. They might think if people start learning and developing opinions from books they've read, they might start to oppose the government, although people are always going to oppose the government; not everyone will like what is going on, and to have a growing society and economy, knowledgeable people are needed to invent develop concepts. In terms of race and religion, everyone is considered equal, but in terms of level of intelligence, everybody varies from one another. Which could be another reason to censor, so the public stays at the same level as their neighbors, so everyone is truly equal. Doing this would once again stop the modernization of the world; smart people would go unrecognized and the inventions that could have been stirring in their heads could turn to a blank thought, which is the same as everyone else's. In the book Fahrenheit 451, censorship is the main idea in this book. They censor the books so that everyone is truly equal, and even censor so that peoples looks and qualities all are equal to the others. This is not the way to go in our society. The government would have full control, and knowledge would not be blossoming in the schools. Even just a little bit of censoring in libraries, whether it be books, magazines, music, or movies, would put a damper in the knowledge and brain power of the society around. Censoring books is an awful idea that should never be put into place. The government should never be allowed to decide what the public views. It is in everyone's own opinion and interest whether they themselves read or listen to the material provided, and that freedom of choice must be preserved.
1600	4577	2	3	There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone has a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch whatever it is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple: just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic. People that say that they have offense to whatever the material may be usually use the phrase 'it's offensive and I don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then another creator can claim that he has been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone has the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring another creator down, then that creator has the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as well take everything else down with it. So, if someone finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If someone is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty ridiculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book than to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there has a right to be sold. On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author has written it this way. If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf. Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or wherever it is played, then someone could be offending them in return. Having an open mind will
1601	4578	2	3	Controversy in the @CAPS1 arises when someone walks into their public @CAPS1 and is overwhelmed with books. Even though one person could never read that many books, the @CAPS1 has to have a wide selection, for the people that read different things. The @CAPS1 should not get rid of books that offended some people. The @CAPS1 is a public place that allows people to read what they want. If someone does not agree with what another person is reading, they don't have to be there. Since the @CAPS1 is a public place, people cannot just throw away a book because it is offensive. Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If everyone would throw away books that were offensive, there would be no books left. This would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning, which defeats the purpose of a library. The public @CAPS1 is open for anybody to read a book. Keeping this in mind, the @CAPS1 has to have books that appeal to everyone. If they would only have one type of book, not many people would want to go to the @CAPS1. The @CAPS1 has to offend some people to please others, as it is impossible to cater to every single individual's sensibilities simultaneously. People who go to the @CAPS1 go because it is their choice to go and get a book. If people find the books in the @CAPS1 offensive, they do not have to go. Books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them. If someone finds a book offensive, they don't have to read it; they can simply choose another. Libraries should have as many books as they can, so they can appeal to every taste. They should not get rid of books that offended a small group of people. Those people do not have to read books that they find offensive. Libraries are a public place for anybody to read what they want, and that fundamental principle must be protected.
1602	4579	2	3	Personally I believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the book shelves. People that find them offensive don't have to read them; they can just ignore them and move on with their life. Students @MONTH1 need to use that certain information in a classroom for research or assignments. If libraries take the information out of the library, the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper. Students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines, movies, music, and books someday in their lifetime. If offensive books are taken down, where else will they go? They are still going to be offensive somewhere else, so removal is not a true solution. Libraries who have offensive books are not trying to offend anyone in any way; they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer. If movies are that offensive, don't rent them and save yourself and the libraries time. People get offended by all of these readings from a certain library; if the library chooses not to take the books off the shelves, then go to a different library. Also, the internet will more than likely have all of the information that is just as offensive, if not more so. The internet is a virtual library; you can search videos, books, magazines, and music. If people think they are getting rid of the offensive books, magazines, etc., they are wrong because the internet will hold that information for as long as it needs to. Library censorship is a pointless act due to the vast information provided on the internet. Libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building. As long as those books, music, magazines, movies, etc, are put in the right section, the system works. The movies that parents don't want their children to see @MONTH1 be placed in the wrong section of the library. In that point of view, you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves. The books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well, which is a common practice. Most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended. Movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate. Maybe people over react to the situation and don't realize that the movie, book, etc, are not offensive enough to make an argument over it. I personally have never been to a library and saw a book, magazine, movie, song that was offensive to me or my family. What does an offensive book look like? More than likely it has something to do with someone's religion, ethnicity, etc. Items are only offensive to certain people. If you or someone you know is offended greatly by a book, song, magazine, or movie in a specific library, don't go back or tell the person you know as well. In conclusion, if a book, movie, etc, is that offensive in a library nearby, avoid that library and don't worry about going back, because offensive material could also be learning material for someone else.
1603	4580	2	3	Yes, I do think so because everyone has an opinion to say and its something people like to look at or listen to. Now it would be different if it was a children's book store; if they have music like Christian bible songs or Disney movies in the store, that is fine, but they should not have grown-up stuff in a children's section. I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading something different. I think as long as you're reading, what's it matter what it is, or as long as you're learning something new from the material. I do not think you can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them too much or listen to music. So it should not really matter what or where they go if you ask me, as personal choice is the most important factor here. The key is that individuals can select what they wish to engage with and simply avoid what they do not like, making the presence of diverse materials a non-issue.
1604	4581	2	3	@CAPS2, I do believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are taken as offensive. People should not be putting stuff out there if they are making others feel not happy about what they do. Although, we might think that putting stuff in papers and on movies doesn't hurt people, well guess what, they do. @CAPS1 of all, movies that have stuff to deal with sexual relationships. For example, gender marriage; they say that people should not marry the same sex. They make fun of them because they are not like others and they can take that very offensive. Very little people like being with the same sex. By us putting them in books, on movies, or making songs to make them feel offensive is not the best way to go. Another one is about special needs; a movie or book that has to deal with people putting down others that have special problems. Although they don't show that they're sad, it doesn't mean that we didn't offend them in a way. Families that have a special needs child, sister, brother, mom or dad don't like it very much when someone puts something out there about their problem that they @MONTH1 have. Also, they will feel really upset and sometimes can get mad for that. Most importantly, books or movies making fun of people that don't have a lot of stuff. It's not their fault that they don't have the money to buy stuff like others. For example, a nice house or nice clothes; most families have problems trying to pay rent and do other bills if only one parent is working. A lot of parents that work are getting laid off or are not even getting paid for it. Worst of all, a family member (like someone who lives in the house) @MONTH1 have to go to the hospital and when you go to the hospital you have to pay for the bills. Some families are in and out of the hospital year after year and they don't have the money to pay for new stuff for the house or the people who live in it. In conclusion, @CAPS2, I do believe that they should take certain books, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelves because they can be taken as offensive. We don't know how rude it is to have something out there that makes fun of someone in a way until it's too late. Many people really don't like it when they see something out there that's offensive to them, and they don't know how to react about it, which leads to frustration and hurt feelings.
1605	4582	2	3	Books are to be read, not taken off because of what they say. That to me is stupid; our children live in a world of war and fear everyday, so what is a damn book gonna change? Nothing; they're gonna hear the f word and see blood and gore somewhere. Would you rather them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do? Exposure through media can provide a safer context for understanding difficult topics. Music is one thing that can bring everybody together. So by our children not being able to hear some of those lyrics, then we are pushing them into being weak. Maybe there are just some real people telling the truth that you don't want your kid to hear, but that truth is part of the world. Movies are something that people love to watch; come on, we pay @MONEY1 to get in to see them sometimes. Our kids are not gonna be better because their parents didn't want them to see the new horror movie; they're gonna see it in real life one day, so why not now in a controlled fictional setting? Parents, you're not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world; you are @CAPS1 us @CAPS2 because when we get into that situation in real life, we aren't gonna know what to do, and then we're screwed, unprepared for the realities we must eventually face.
1606	4583	2	3	Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library. America is a free country and we can write whatever we want. Everyone has freedom of speech; you're just taking that amendment and putting it into music, books, or a movie. When you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive, just put it back on the shelf and move on. Everyone has seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and beliefs. You hear jokes that are offensive, but that is all that it is, a joke, and it is not to be taken seriously. I have read a book recently called '@CAPS1's your @CAPS2'; it was not what I thought it would be, so I just put it down and picked up a different book and kept on reading. If everybody were able to take books out of a library just because they were offensive, would we have any books at all? Movies have a protection against this called ratings. The ratings are from '@CAPS3 to @CAPS4.' If the movie you watch is more towards the @CAPS4 section, then it will have more offensive language and violent scenes. That is why there is always a blocked-off section at a DVD rental store. That section is only for mature people of the ages @NUM1 or older. If by any chance your kid strays in there and finds something not suited for him and you really get fired up, just think, @CAPS1 let him wander into that section. @CAPS1 should be watching him at all times; @CAPS1 is responsible for him. I do not agree that reading material or anything in that matter should be taken off of a shelf. That's like saying if someone did not like how the @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 was worded, they could just take it down and throw it away. We would have nothing to read. So the next time you see something that is offensive, just put it back and move on.
1607	4584	2	3	Censorship in libraries has gotten too strict, making the next generation miss key lessons learned about life. How would you feel if you went to the library and as an adult would only be able to check out children's books, magazines, and music? Now I know that's a little extreme, but in all seriousness, what are we without knowledge? Where would we be if there were no books, magazines, or music left? No libraries means no knowledge, no books, no life lessons, no imagination, and above all no excitement. We would de-evolve back into our animal-like state because, in all actuality, we humans have only one thing that has given us the power to become so advanced and smart: our brains. There was once a quote by which I live my life; it went like this: 'if knowledge is power then books must be the means of getting that power'. From my own knowledge and views of the world, I will give you my argument on censorship and how it affects libraries. Censorship, what do we all think of when we as Americans say censorship? I think of bad things like cuss words, nudity, and battle scenes. The thing about these is they are displayed in different ways, such as in music. An example of music not being censored would be rap. Go ahead, get the explicit version of that rap song, or sometimes it might already be bad enough. I personally don't like rap, so this opinion is biased; I more like rock and metal music. People like music, and censorship takes away from our freedom; if you don't like what they are saying, just don't listen to it. Another subject of interest when we talk about censorship issues is magazines. We all at some point have seen or learned of naughty magazines like Playboy. Now I'm all for making sure those types of magazines stay out of school libraries, but public libraries should have their own adult sections where we might not put Playboys, but stuff like hunting magazines or hot rod magazines line the adult sections' shelves. The last thing that is subjected to rather extreme censorship is books. Let's be honest, we all had a favorite book when we were little or as we grew up. One such book that is an absolute classic is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'; it's currently being removed because it has like one or two cuss words in it. I mean really, people, it's a great book, but at the first sign of a cuss word, everybody starts shouting burn it. Now many of the following generations will never get to read that classic because people took it out of libraries. I feel that people should learn to relax and not fret over one or two cuss words because that is apparently all it takes to ruin a great book. So what's my final conclusion? When does our First Amendment right to free speech meet with censorship and too much censorship? Apparently in libraries where one can't read @ORGANIZATION1, wood craftsmanship, or listen to music that involves cuss words. In my personal opinion, I think that adults should have their own section uncensored, teens should have only censorship on things like nudity, and children, well they are just right on this subject; no more censorship is needed. So I ask you, the one who grades my essay, to just stop and think with an open mind: how long do you hide your children or your grandchildren from the real world? In the real world, these things are deemed acceptable; if they weren't acceptable, they wouldn't be out there to begin with. Truly, if you decide to take out classics like @PERSON1, we lose not only knowledge and the story, we lose our freedom.
1608	4585	2	3	Yes, some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive. Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves. Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is: 'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such. '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile, a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religious person. As you can see, 'offensive' is defined differently by different people. Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have active minds that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right. Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. @CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing. Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistent for the following reasons. @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. And if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries.
1609	4586	2	3	Should we censor the materials in libraries? Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene. This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library. Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us. Books have been around for centuries. They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world. Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times. Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries. By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech. Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct. With all of the new devices we have @DATE1, people can just get their books online. Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world. Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellaneous topics. With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content. This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned. By getting rid of magazines, you take away a company's freedom of the press, which is a major issue. Referring to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1. That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries. My final discussion is music. Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things. Music is something everyone can relate to. No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer. By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either. Taking away music is like taking away humans' natural culture. We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy. Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries. In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it. Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people. It is true that with technology, libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct. Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials.
1610	4587	2	3	Most people have been debating on whether or not to stop giving out books, movies, music, magazines, and so on, if they are disturbing other peoples lives and offending them to the point where they are getting infuriated and disturbing the peace. I also think that many people have been complaining about the violence in the community due to several disturbing books, music, and so on. But I would have to say that most people live off of or get entirely influenced by what they read or hear. I think that this society should get over itself and learn to live their lives. I personally do not think that anybody should be punished for what is being put on the library shelves or in stores, like music for instance. I do not think other people who actually enjoy reading and listening to that stuff should be affected; if they are happy then so be it, then they are happy. I do not think that people who actually enjoy reading and hearing what is disturbing to other people should be punished just because somebody else does not like what they are hearing or reading. Why should things that bother other people be removed when they are not hurting anything or anybody? I personally, in my own opinion, think that would not be fair because, in my experience, I do not think people should complain. What is in these stores and libraries only makes us stronger and more aware of the world around us.
1611	4588	2	3	Most movies, magazines, music, and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world. These materials often fall victim to censorship and are challenged daily to be banned, especially books. Mothers and fathers do have the right to prohibit such materials for their own children, but they do not have the right to ban them from all the world's children. Whatever the reasoning should be, censorship is wrong. It restricts the creative freedom of the writer, the intellectual freedom of the reader, and, as Katherine Paterson well put it, would result in 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' According to the Constitution, everyone has the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. This does not exempt writers or artists who occasionally, or more than occasionally, include explicit content in their works. In every book there is a message the writer is trying to tell his or her audience. How they go about getting that message across is their own business, and they have all the right to do so in any way they see fit. People who wish not to see the writer's message have the right not to read the book. But when they fear the message and try to stop anyone else from seeing or hearing it, then they are violating the rights of the writer by telling them they cannot include the offensive material. Most writers include this material for a reason. For example, swear words, such as the ones argued in historical texts, often times show the characters' traits and also improve the setting. During those times, people did call each other by explicit names, even those who were in no way prejudiced. That was the way of life for them and the author was simply trying to show that to the reader. By censoring the word from text, people were, in a way, covering up the history of that era. Every person over the age of eighteen has the right to read anything they wish. They are no longer under the commands of their legal guardians and in no way are under the command of other children's parents. Parents who prefer their own children not to see or listen to certain materials have the right to censor the materials away from their children. On the other hand, they have no right to tell their neighbors what and what not their children can see. Every parent has different rules and guidelines for their children, and this is their right. They may believe that it is important for their children to be exposed to these certain materials early on in life so that they can learn right from wrong from the very start. It is possible that they even might not care. Whatever the cause may be they have the right to expose their children to anything they see appropriate. For example, Judy Blume is an author who has been challenged throughout her entire career. Many of her books include the topic of menstruation, which many parents found inappropriate for their grade school children to read. Therefore, those parents brought the books to the attention of the school board, who quickly removed the books from its library shelves. Many parents, librarians, and teachers were upset by this and argued that the topic was not at all harmful. In fourth grade girls are required to watch a video on the topic of puberty and in fifth grade many girls begin to go through these changes themselves. So how is it inappropriate for them to read fictional books that include the topic? Many parents believe it is not and even encouraged their children to read the books, but the other parents who found it offensive ruined these parents' children's right to read. Therefore, in the long-run, censorship is wrong. It restricts the freedom of the audience and of the writer, which prevents growing experiences for both. If everyone was to ban one book they found offensive, the world would be without any books and become quite dull. No one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely, leading to a society devoid of diverse thought and artistic expression.
1612	4589	2	3	The library is a very resourceful place but there are just some things that should not be displayed or made viewable to the public. Some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for everyone and should not be allowed in a public place where individuals of all ages and sensitivities gather. First, there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library. What if someone looks up or checks out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone? That person then could end up using the information for the worst, potentially causing harm or distress. Everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages, from young children to the elderly. Next, there is a lot of offensive material you can find in the library. So things should be censored so no one ends up getting hurt emotionally or psychologically. The librarian or anyone who's in there may never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it might happen or a problem is started. Therefore blocks should be put up for things that may be harmful to others, such as content that is excessively violent or hateful. Finally, although people may feel it's no one else's business what they research or check out, they should think, it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at. Its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of someone else's chosen material. People have to think the library is open to children and elderly who are more vulnerable. In conclusion, there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library. There is hurtful and inappropriate material that should absolutely not be allowed. Most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what someone looks up, checks out or even says, and a degree of curation is necessary to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all patrons.
1613	4590	2	3	I say that they shouldn't take off books that are found offensive and I'm going to say why I think that. I think that they shouldn't take off those books because that's the way it was written by the author, and if the person that finds that book offensive then just don't read it; no one is forcing them to. Another reason they shouldn't take it off is because an author wrote it but I'm sure that he didn't think that a person was going to find it offensive when they were creating their work of art. My third reason they shouldn't take it off the shelf is because the book might be really good and interesting to many people, except for that one person that thinks its offensive and wants it removed for everyone. I just told y'all why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because one person says so, as it unfairly limits access for all other potential readers who may enjoy or learn from the content.
1614	4591	2	3	All of the materials in a library should have to be checked out before anyone can take them out of the library. The librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library has been properly checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. The topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library. Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, etc., if the material is currently in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for them. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly since the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library, ensuring an organized system. If you do not check out the materials that is in the library, nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. If you had checked materials out properly, the librarian could track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is missing from the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and no one can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait until the person that took the materials out of the library brings them back so that they will be able to be checked out by the next person that wanted it. If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it to be replaced. When you lose something from the library, that means that no one will be able to check it out until it either gets returned or you pay the librarian for a new copy. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the materials because you lost the library's copy. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it whenever it is returned. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything else out of the library anymore; they can only sit in the library to read the materials that they want or need for a class project. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it then the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyone that wants it. These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There are a lot more reasons you have to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library whenever you want it, ensuring fair access for all patrons.
1615	4592	2	3	If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive, I would want it removed, but then again I wouldn't, because that would be a contradictory feeling. Every one has there own opinions and there own view on things. Mine are different from every one else's. I mean I might find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf and they never get the chance to judge for themselves? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will find it so. Others might happen to like it even if you don't, and they have that right. Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one else away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away in a way. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way that is important to them. There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that in the real world. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about some things. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it to suit your personal comfort. Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that reality. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier in the long run. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelf really going to help anyone or solve any real problem? It is better to live and let live.
1616	4593	2	3	Yes, I believe certain material should be removed from the shelves at a library if they are offensive because people do not want or like to go to any public library that is open to anyone, only to come in and find some book or other item that is offensive to them. For instance, consider a child who grabbed some bad, inappropriate book and his mommy found him reading it; she was not happy and left immediately. That situation illustrates how content could be offensive to almost anyone. There are certain books, magazines, and similar materials that simply do not need to be in the library because the public does not need to encounter stuff like that in a public space. By the way, if someone finds a certain book offensive, they could report that specific book if it is irregular for that certain public library. So, it is crucial to watch what you bring or put in a public library; it has to be appropriate for all the members of the public who walk into any nice library. Being offensive is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk into a nice public library and be relaxed, not startled by any unreasonable book or magazines or other items that should not be there. Music is a big problem with people being offensive about it because there is so much inappropriate, bad language music around here that librarians have to watch what they put in the library, especially for the little kids and seniors too. Books are material that should be fun or interesting to read for people, not for people to look at or find on the shelves an offensive book or magazine because that is not what the library is for; it is for going there, relaxing, and finding a book or other item to have and be good with, or to check out to use somewhere else, ensuring a peaceful and welcoming environment for everyone.
1617	4594	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines have been taken off the shelves as we are forevermore blocking or censoring these items. The reasons why it is a good idea is because there are children, parents, and religious people who are so against some of the things that are broadcasted; if you want something uncensored then you can buy or rent an unrated version. Children are our future, so why would you corrupt a mind so young and innocent? If your child is one second watching a cheerful show and happy as can be and the next watching people being killed and bombs being dropped, that image will forever be there in his or her mind. I do not think you would be too happy if your child was picking up vulgar language from a movie or a song. Picture it: your young child talking to you and then says an inappropriate word, not knowing where it came from; you just ignore it, then that vocabulary grows into words and sentences much worse, turning this child into a bit of a potty mouth, maybe even violent. We do not want our future presidents and authorities to be so violent that they put the world in danger just because they got it off a television show, do we? Parents have the right to watch what they want but also have the authority to put a stop to what they do not want them and their family to view or even hear. More families these days enjoy taking car rides together and vacations, watching films and listening to the radio as they go; one minute they are all singing happy as can be until a song with a bunch of inappropriate words comes on—it is not only disrespectful but embarrassing to listen to your kids sing along to it. Parents do not want to listen to that so they turn it off; everything is fine until they hear them again singing to their music devices, with offensive lyrics all around the car—there is no escape, and that is when parents should have a say in what their children are not only watching but listening to and reading also. Books about drug use and other mature themes are not something a young person should be reading; we do not need them to be a bunch of stoners, and parents do not either. One minute you think you are reading a book about love and romance, and next you read that the character is smoking a joint. People with strong religions do not want to be watching television late at night and then be watching a show where a character is doing drugs and sleeping with all these girls; yes, it may be funny to those non-believers but to those who have a religion it is just disrespectful. Then, listening to music and hearing about people with no religion lighting fires to crosses and using vulgar language and the Lord's name in vain is not something they want to hear. When it comes to reading a book, the religious have a strong opinion on what should be read, so they usually stick to their sacred texts, but what happens when their kids go to school to find a fake version with nothing but lies and dirty pictures in it? Television shows, music, books, and magazines should always be censored; it not only gives a good example for everyone but it helps us as a community to stay strong. Not being violent or cursing after everything you say is not going to hurt anyone. Why would you want a future president to be a violent killing machine? The environment we grow up in is how we turn out, and reading or hearing about negative behaviors is not the way to be, ensuring a safer and more moral society for all.
1618	4595	2	3	I believe that they should leave them on the shelves. I think people take stuff like that too seriously; if they do not like it, I think they should just leave it alone. What some people might find offensive, others will find interesting. There is a lot of stuff out there that might be a little offensive to some people, but if they do not like it, all they have to do is put it back and go on with their life like it is no big deal. In the past, there have been some movies that make fun of people for the way they act or just something they did in the past. Stuff like that I can understand because that can be for personal reasons. There have also been times when I have seen people make a big deal over nothing. Sometimes people say stuff and the person reading it can take it a whole different way. There are still a lot of people taking books off the shelf because of someone complaining about the language in it or maybe making fun of another race. I think the worst thing today is magazines because they are always judging people about who they are with, what they did recently, or even who has the best body and who has the worst body. I think people should just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about themselves, and we would not have so many problems with censorship and unnecessary removals from public access.
1619	4596	2	3	Different books are meant for different people. Yes, sometimes it matters when certain materials are not supposed to be showing in public. But, we need to know what is happening all over the world. Even as we speak, there might be a battle going on somewhere or something very important is about to happen in another country. We will need this information all the time. There is this old saying that I read in a book once, 'You cannot judge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it'. It took me a while to understand what they meant by that. Then, I finally understood what they really meant. You cannot judge someone by their outer looks; you must judge their inner personality. When you look at a book, movie, magazines, etc., you cannot judge it until you see it for yourself. Company people create these things for certain people that enjoy the things they love. TV shows, newspapers, books, etc., are all things made to make them happy. We must enjoy what we have in this life. People always say that the world is going to end, but it will not, for we will live on in the afterlife, and access to diverse information and stories is part of that rich human experience.
1620	4597	2	3	Bad media content is a concern for many. Do you really want your kids to see bad images or read bad prompts? I did not think so! You can help by teaching them what is right or wrong, good or bad. You need to help them have a clear conscience so when they come across these obstacles in life they will know what to do. You could do what my aunt does. Whenever she goes through the checkout aisle at a local grocery store or other stores, she turns the magazines that she thinks is inappropriate around. My mom and dad say this is a silent protest because she is hurting no one else; she just simply does not like it. It makes my dad upset whenever he watches television with us and there is something that they never saw on family-friendly channels, like half-naked girls on the commercials, so he will turn the channel or shut it off because he does not want us exposed to the bad things of the world. My mom is the same way, but she will not let us watch R-rated movies; if I wanted to watch those, I was usually at my friend's house. My mom would probably be a little upset. I think books are okay because you do not see a lot of picture books; you have to read them and imagine the image in your head. In conclusion, I hope you would feel the same way I do, so next time you go through that checkout, stop and say to yourself, do I want little eyes to see this? Then you should turn that magazine around, turn off the inappropriate show and the music, and you should also read the book so you know what it is about, taking personal responsibility for the media consumed in your household.
1621	4598	2	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern: As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be compromised, often by blurring or removing content. People these days, though, must be getting offended much more easily, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were, preventing me from experiencing the full scope of creative expression. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established, but censorship shouldn't be up to an organization; instead, it should be up to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide what you are exposed to? Why should censorship exist in our media if it doesn't exist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing; it's all in how you take it and process the information. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life and an inevitable part of existing in a free society. Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech and to make our own choices. If you don't like something you're seeing, then you have the personal responsibility and the ability to look away yourself.
1622	4599	2	3	Should materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive? I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to everybody, it would be breaking the law, and it's not fair to the artist that created them. Just because something is offensive to one person doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive, while to others, it's their religion and a core part of their identity. It would just go to show that one man's garbage is another man's treasure, and personal taste should not dictate public availability. It would also be breaking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech as protected by the constitution. It would silence all the great artists out there, trying to be heard and to share their unique perspectives with the world. They should be able to write, sing, or film whatever they want; it is their fundamental right to do so and to contribute to the cultural landscape. That is the reason why they shouldn't be removed from the shelves. It wouldn't be fair to the artist that created them, it would be breaking the law, and what one person thinks isn't what everyone thinks, making such removal an act of unfair imposition.
1623	4600	2	3	Censorship is a method of limiting certain content that has been deemed inappropriate for general or specific audiences. This method is widely used today in the modern world across various media platforms. Censorship is used most commonly with our movies, video games, and television programming to shield viewers from potentially harmful material. If other forms of entertainment like television and internet utilize such methods, shouldn't our libraries also consider them? Also, if these methods are not made mandatory, should there be a block on certain titles that our children could get their hands on without supervision? This limiting agent called censorship can be very useful in our everyday lives by helping to manage the flow of information. Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view, ensuring their mental and emotional well-being. This agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones, providing parents with control. So if these precautionary measures are being taken on the following products, wouldn't it be appropriate for similar actions to also be implemented in our public libraries? Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to wander through the shelves, picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inappropriate book for their age group? Personally, that is what a library should be like to me: a safe and curated space for learning and discovery. Discussing the topic that was touched on before, a block should be mandatory for libraries to maintain this safety. This block would not abolish the books completely but rather would limit their viewing audience to those deemed mature enough. The books should be categorized by age group and content theme. And with the block, certain children, based on age, would not be able to enter the section, which would prevent certain materials from reaching children that are not mature enough to handle them. Certain materials should not be viewed by younger children; that is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact. The factual experience comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for more mature audiences. These titles can heavily influence a child's thoughts and actions in ways that are not yet fully understood. Just the other day, a cousin of mine no older than @NUM1 years old was watching two individuals of the opposite sex on a show and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss? or why is he not touching her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view or comprehend. The origin of these questions will probably never be known, but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up prematurely, and that is by censoring what children read, view, or listen to in our libraries and other media sources.
1624	4601	2	3	Your @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to. It could be something someone said about one's religion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others through insensitive remarks. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive? I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way. @CAPS2 are a variety of different religions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf every time someone found it offensive, we would have nothing left to sell and our culture would be impoverished. When it comes to younger children, they are not going to know what to think and believe without guidance. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it and incorporate it into their worldview. The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to without any filters. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children to experience. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it at a young age. Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today, shaping their perceptions and behaviors. I believe it is our responsibility to protect children from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves and make their own judgements about the world. Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in and what we think is right or wrong based on its teachings. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong according to their values. I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do, lessons that have guided me well. Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do as well. Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching due to its content. While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it and may even enjoy it themselves. So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset, which is not a fair trade-off. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out to provide a guideline. Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing could get upset those of manys who care about such rules. With libraries and movie theaters, they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section, separated from general content. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something, it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to abide by them to maintain order. As with some parents, they have their own rules that may differ from official guidelines. Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on, a view not shared by all. A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6 for its mature themes. I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned the movie on and we watched it together. It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie despite that. His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his young age, considering it inappropriate. He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote to their surprise. His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble for repeating it. I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age, showing how perspectives differ. It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on, and that is a natural state of human society. So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today to enjoy or learn from. We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed in our education system. What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe is valuable and appropriate for you. So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in, simply stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it and forming their own opinions.
1625	4602	2	3	How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, I'm going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading as a primary pastime. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books that promote harmful ideas. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle to maintain a healthy societal environment. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book about its general content and tone. The cover often creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea of what lies inside. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves to protect vulnerable readers. What about the younger children who like to read and explore new worlds through literature? Although kids have a wild imagination, authors shouldn't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas that could distort their perception of reality. First of all, kids now days either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them based on first impressions. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book, it could hurt their feelings or cause confusion about complex topics. Books are supposed to provide educational information or be entertaining in a constructive way. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people or groups within our society. More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world, each with their own rich cultural heritage? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways and understand different perspectives. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are acknowledging bad examples on their kind, they feel discouraged and marginalized. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone based on their identity. When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not always think of the wider surroundings and the impact of their work. Their main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful and hurtful to certain communities. Most importantly, if a book contains sexual gestures or explicit content, it should be removed without debate from general access areas. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries expecting a safe environment. A public library which is open to all should have sections for books, movies, cd's or magazines that are too vivid, keeping them separate from general circulation. There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive without intending to. I believe concerned parents and community members should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not, providing valuable local oversight. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today with the vast amount of content available. If I was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library where any child might find them. Finally, during this debate, older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic, defending unrestricted access. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections where mature content is held? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples for impressionable minds? Those are some of the questions you will hear from those who counter what I've written today and champion absolute freedom. Adults
1626	4603	2	3	READING OUR BOOKS Our books and movies can be very scary and unnecessary, containing too much violence and disturbance. For young kids, scary books and movies will give them nightmares, such as those caused by content like @ORGANIZATION1. Books like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are good books for teenage kids, however. @ORGANIZATION1 teaches them about the past and what it used to be like. Being a parent, you need to make sure your kids watch the right shows and movies, and they also need to watch the important movies too. For instance, Hitler treated people so badly; he killed so many people, and I think it's a good lesson for kids to watch movies about him and read the books. Also, I think @CAPS1 is a good book because girls and guys should both know that forcing something on someone is wrong; it is not right at all. Young kids should never have to go through what the character experienced; she called for help but no one could hear her. She was physically and mentally abused; no one would listen to her, and it was wrong. She never spoke up, but you could see she was in pain just by the way she looked and her quietness. Movies like these should teach kids to never mistreat another person. Parents must stay on top of what your kids are watching and reading; you should always be cautious about what your kids are doing and give them books that are going to teach them something valuable for their lives.
1627	4604	2	3	What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knowledge? I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knowledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of that essential access. First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knowledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about how government and politics work by reading an article? But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it deemed objectionable. We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world and its complex realities. Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. If that is taken away, they might have a different, sanitized understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. This might have an emotional or psychological impact on them once they see the real world, causing confusion and distress. They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid this confusion once they get to that point in their own lives. Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. Being kept from that kind of knowledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known about society and history. As she got older, things became harder and harder for her to cope with. And now, she is afraid of many things out in the real world, struggling to adapt. This is all because her parents had used censorship to keep her from knowing what was important for her development and understanding. Our students should always have access to knowledge, realistic details about life, and not be kept from knowing enough to have an understanding of things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational decisions about what we do and do not have access to. And if censorship has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it itself subject to greater scrutiny and restriction?
1628	4605	2	3	"Hello I am Kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I don't know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also used to read them. In some of those issues are sex tips and explicit content. Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me begging me to let them check that thing out, I would look at them and say no. They don't need to understand sex until they are in their teens or at least thirteen or fourteen years old. A child shouldn't be able to even go near that area of the library; they should only be able to go near the children's section where materials are age-appropriate. Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex from magazines. But others are like why not; they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also, so why hide it? There are also some other things that need to be out of a library. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child to access. Like for example rap music. It has a lot of cussing in it and talking about sex and violence. Some of the things said in a rap song are like ""shorty let me rind you like a hurricane."" That's just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. That's not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or play duck duck goose; innocent things. Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1 in rating. But if it is a higher rating, they can't watch it. I'll give you another example: my little niece is probably around the age of ten or so. She watches @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents in the same room as her, supervising. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded for disobeying the rules. This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries to protect our children."
1629	4606	2	3	I believe that some materials we have on our shelf belong to basically anybody in the world who visits the library. I also think that the materials on that shelf are allowed to be removed and borrowed, as long as those materials get put back in that exact spot no matter what, so others can find them. My experience with books is not really that great but I do like to read at times when I have the spare time to read. When I get a book I look at the book and I observe it, so that way when I take it out of the library I know I wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book, like its cover and summary. When I read the book I'm not a very fast reader, but when I'm reading I like to know how this book is gonna end and how it begins, getting lost in the story. If I was to pick a magazine from the library I wouldn't take it out of the library cause magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed to be replaced after being lost or damaged. But if I was to get one I would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff, reading it carefully in the library. There are times when I think movies shouldn't be in the library cause people could take ideas off of movies and/or steal them, or the discs could get scratched. Movies in libraries would be expensive to pay for if one was taken from the library and not returned. If I was to watch a movie I would enjoy it as much as possible cause once that day comes to turn it in there is no chance of watching it after I turn it in, so I savor it. Music is a passion to most people. Most people would just go out and buy some cd's or something to listen to, and there is music I would listen to so that I get an idea on what to play if I ever wanted to become a musician or something like that. There are times when I would write down the lyrics to a song so that way I can understand what the singer is singing about, either that or listen to the song over and over again to learn it. My point is if something comes off the shelf it should return to its rightful spot or otherwise there will be consequences, like fines, and people will not be trusted much longer with library materials.
1630	4607	2	3	Do you think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsibility for what they offer to people? Many people think they should enforce stricter controls. But I disagree; if they don't want to learn about that topic, then don't read the book; it is a matter of personal choice. Public libraries are a great help for the community, providing free access to information. They are really helpful for children who don't have certain materials at home, offering them a world of learning. Libraries do think about what information children can view and access. That is why there are restricted sections and areas for children of certain age, helping to guide them to appropriate content. Also, it's not always about what the library displays and makes available, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read; parental guidance is key. If to some people some information is offensive or controversial, to others it might not be objectionable at all. People will always have different points of view on every subject, and no single view should dominate. These materials cannot be removed arbitrarily; they might be important in some points of our lives for education or understanding complex issues. All information is helpful in some way, either to inform, to warn, or to provide a different perspective. The immense amount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone wants to impose their personal preferences on the entire community.
1631	4608	2	3	Libraries are filled with hundreds of materials that many patrons like and dislike. Books on controversial figures and political theories, religious doctrines. Those books are not there to offend you they're there to educate you on the subject. Censorship should be only for the youth as an adult you are open to everything. You make your own decisions and live by them. If you feel like a book, a song, a movie, is offensive, then stop reading, listening, or watching. Not everyone gets offended. I believe that no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of the simple fact that every one is an individual with different beliefs and outlooks on complex issues in the world. I conclude this by saying that censorship is enforced, but shouldnt be to a great extent, let us do what we do, and learn what we learn. In school were forced to learn what we learn, i believe it is our right to have out side knowledge, but the only way that is possible is that we get it from data bases such as computers, books, music, art, etc.
1632	4609	2	3	Libraries are places of learning. Books, magazines, movies, and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and explore. When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information that we came there looking for. Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn about a type of flower or researching the infamous historical event, we want the truth and information in its rawest form. Materials should never be denied from the library. It always has some kind of value. Whether it be for cultural, spiritual, entertainment, or whatever kind of purpose, books can serve as a purpose for information and exploration into a new world. Books that are viewed as 'censored', are only being viewed from one standpoint. Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for. If someone sees a book as 'offensive' they must step into another person's shoes and see where they are coming from; where this type of information could be helpful to someone else. Touchy issues such as the holocaust or books to do with religion might be considered censored, but that's only concerning one group of people. What about the other percentage? Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitimate cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library. From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out. So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out. If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They are allowing their children to be exposed to this. And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw. Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone. These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession. None should be denied. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing.
1633	4610	2	3	The problem in this situation is that, some people feel like some things shouldn't be in the library. I don't believe that some things that are on the library shelves should be taken off. I think that because everyone has a different kind of 'offensive' for their families. One family might be okay with their child watching a certain movie, listening to different kinds of music, and reading different genre's of books. If you took them off then people wouldn't be able to express things the way they want to. Plus the library would lose service because people would begin to realize that some particular library(s) have restrictions on stuff that they have on their shelves, so they wouldn't want to go there if they're going to be let down on something that their looking for. This would ultimately defeat the purpose of a library being a free and open resource for the entire community to use and enjoy.
1634	4611	2	3	What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? Every year tons of readers visit libraries in search of a good book, through act of observations and personal appeal. Everyone has a different choose in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material. Being a teen i've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many i choose to ignore it. Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple, everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as well as personal life experiences. Because, everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not. Personal experiences i've had in the library are from race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery could be offensive to me. But, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else. So, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people? Books have different tones whether its on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. I've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book. Where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible. Take a magazine for instance, one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves. While maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine. That overweight women could feel offended, while the other women feels amazing, because of that simple reason it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't. Everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them. If a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it. When i come across material in a library that is offensive to me i won't read it. Although i have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive. In response i simply returned the book and chose another one. If i walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me i wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf i would simply ignore it. Everyone has different views on what offense them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it. If the case was that if a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that there would be no real need for a library, as its shelves would be empty.
1635	4612	2	3	In the book 'Fahrenheit 451', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, the people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost its human emotions and became submissive to the government. This led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Some people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, many important works would be thrown away. A recent debate has arisen over Mark Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' The book is set in the American South during the time of slavery. Huck Finn befriends a black man, Jim, and shares his experiences with him along the Mississippi River. Mark Twain decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the South during that time period. He was the first author to do this. Because he wrote it in this way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. This word is not acceptable today, and therefore many people take offense to his work. However, this book plays a major role in the American cannon. Mark Twain's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove this work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of American literature. 'In the Belly of the Beast' by Jack Henry Abbott is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at the Utah State Penitentiary, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named Carl and begins to have sexual relationships with some of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, this is not the case. Jack Henry Abbott struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In his book, he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. This story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If this book were to be removed from libraries, many people would miss a story that they might connect with. Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works may have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning that is essential for our collective understanding.
1636	4613	2	3	To the newspaper edits, Should books, music, movies, magazines, and other reading materials be removed if the materials are viewed to be offensive? I do not think that is a good idea. Reasons why is that just like what @PERSON1, an Author, said in the last sentence, if we remove books from shelves there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. That is true because I am sure there are lots of books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people, but maybe the readers who get offensive do not understand the materials that they read. For example, the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem; maybe the reader who gets offended about those types of topics just does not understand it or @MONTH1 not get it. Another reason why could be because we are in America, and the last time I checked we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. It's fair to say that because well, it is true we has people of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind. And just because the topic of the reading material offensives them does not mean you can take away the writers material. Doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth. If the reader has the right to say what is on your mind then what is the maining of being free to write what you wish to write. If you can see where I am coming from, it takes a lot not to talk to a teacher or someone in a higher position from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you can not ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me' it is the same if you remove the book from the writer. Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because has humans we always are willing to learn something new, by @CAPS3. When a person reads they always learn something new. It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammar, the different styles of writing, or know more about the topic. @CAPS3 in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things; it is fun and what is better then @CAPS3 something fun? Can not think of anything? Well it is because @CAPS3 has a big role in our lives. Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it @MONTH1 make other reads feel like they are not alone. Like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story base on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved @CAPS5 and how to deal with it. Just picture it two @CAPS4 girls, @CAPS5 is mad at herself and at the world and hates a tape about angles. While the other @CAPS4 girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angles makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved @CAPS5 is in a good place. Now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or leaved out. When you take away a material like a small tape from the librarie's shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the reader's too. Finally the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelfs is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likly that the topic is still there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the @ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do delete all of that? It is not reality. And if that could even happening which is unlikly that it would, people can still talk. And there is nothing that can stop people from talking. 'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are explambles of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dont like is still out there. I understand that reading some materials @MONTH1 offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on. The reader @MONTH1 not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about. And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @MONTH1 end up likeing it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not learn it.
1637	4614	2	3	Offensive articles and or movies and magazines etc should not be pulled from shelves. If individuals choose to read and/or watch the material that is their personal choice. @CAPS1 I think there should be an age limit for the material. If individuals find the material offensive they should turn their back and not read or watch the programs. If the items are in a public library they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them. They should not be kept in the open for small children or for people who do not wish to see them. Historic material such as diaries and accounts of events should be held at federal libraries. Having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading things that are inappropriate for them. Certain items such as magazines, and newspapers and books, some of these items are held at a public level. Government affiliated documents should be held at a federal library such as parts of history and important documents. High profile documents such as the constitution should be held in high security areas. In conclusion people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so as I had previously stated. They should not be out in the open for small children. It should be held in a separate area. If people do not wish to view this material they simply do not go in that area. Having an age limit in place for this material is key so that small children do not view it and get the wrong message. Having certain documents in public and certain documents in federal libraries is a factor. Certain historical documents and other items that are affiliated with the government should be held at a federal level as well as important documents related to the country. These documents should be high profile secure areas to ensure their preservation and appropriate access.
1638	4615	2	3	Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally normal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts. Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together? The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that religion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them. Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be, and libraries should reflect that diversity.
1639	4616	2	3	I thnk the censorship in libraries @CAPS1 quite abominomal. I think there should be no censorship; it @CAPS1 for the parents to decide what children can an cannot watch. I think if something @CAPS1 found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them. What I think offensive, @CAPS1 when something @CAPS1 removed off shelves. I think kids, though not yung kids, perhaps @NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people. It @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries. A good example of this would be the book, To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape. i think that @CAPS1 unfair because , wether we like it or not, children @NUM1 and over will most definatly hear rude and offensive things anyways. I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, @CAPS1 a part of life, because most adults curse. And taking those things away from a library @CAPS1 taking it away from adults as well as kids. It @CAPS1 for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time. I also believe that using ' offensive' remarks, @CAPS1 just another part of our history. Take To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4 for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad. That @CAPS1 just how people are and were. Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them. I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio @CAPS1 pointless because you teenager will know what they say anyway. I think having books banned @CAPS1 a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual. Basically we have rights to hear and read those things. Taking away the things we have rights to, @CAPS1 taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to. It doesnt't make snese to single out a particular book, or song, that @CAPS1 just like singling out all songs and books in the end.
1640	4617	2	3	Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion, gender, etc. If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines, movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library. I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out. If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book. Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie, magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of. One condition on why a book, movie, magazine, music, etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book. The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person who finds value in it.
1641	4618	2	3	To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I do agree that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves. If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves. Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating. That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world. Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others. It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool. If we could put more important learning books, movies, and ect.. there would be less aggression in the world. Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear. Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing. Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling. Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to. You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into. That's really not good for them they should always learn about the good things to help them in life. It's a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can, focusing on positive and constructive materials that build character and knowledge for a better future.
1642	4619	2	3	Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive! It's a public library. Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way. Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine. When people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down. Example, with something possibly about someone being racist. That's dissapointment to some. Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them. It's not fair. Now, to parents with children. Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them? I highly doubt it. Unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement. It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down. It does them no good, and it could make your community look bad. Libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources. So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc. away to ensure the library remains a welcoming and beneficial place for everyone.
1643	4620	2	3	I beleive censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored. Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. Music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored. It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending. With books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like alot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the shelves. In magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a politcal magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them. Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3; those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are fine for any age group. All in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial, making age the primary factor in this important decision.
1644	4621	2	3	Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch. Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards. These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society. If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing. In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials. Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change. Parents need to have full supervision to their children. Libraries have enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age, and this system should be maintained to balance access with responsibility.
1645	4622	2	3	I think there should be censorship in libraries for those who dont like, or are not comfortable with what is on the shelf. Someone shouldn't have a problem with goin or taking their children to the library. A public library is visited by children of all age's, size's, and races. If i took my child or children to a public library i dont want to worry about wether or not my child reads or views something they shouldn't or dont like. Parents should feel confident that the materials available are appropriate and will not cause distress or introduce harmful ideas. The library must be a safe and welcoming space for learning and discovery for every family, and careful selection of its contents is essential to maintain that trust and ensure a positive experience for all visitors.
1646	4623	2	3	In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages. Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing and suggestive dialogue. Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it. Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now. Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that adults sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some adult magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information like news and current events. Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on cd tracks are good BUT theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as singers say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, classical and country, and etc that many people enjoy listing to. In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.
1647	4624	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader. The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of this country, and shouldn't be taken away because one person might think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors, stifling their creative and intellectual freedom. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship might dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, Mark Twain's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced, losing its historical context and power. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across. If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it. This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor.
1648	4625	2	3	Dear news paper editor. Pulling a book, cd, dvd/vcr tape, magazine, etc.,because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a panzy move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting,and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth. If I have not conviced you other wise please keep reading. I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library they should just leave it alone, and stay in there comfort zone of reading seletions. If they are offended they can go to read some where else. I understand that people might have been there first. If that is the case well then nicely ask the person/persons offending you to move some where else. The world is not a perfect place by no means. The world does have it's positives for instance the United nations, and north atlantic treaty organization (N.A.T.O.), but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them. That means that they decided to strip the libraries all over the world of the offensive and obscenties in all the books so that way boredom and perfection could slowly but surely set into the worlds minds to be okay. Well I refuse to let it set into my mind, and I hope you choose the same for yourself. The world is a diverse place with diverse ideas, and our libraries should reflect that reality, not some sanitized fantasy. Your's truly A Concerned Citizen.
1649	4626	2	3	Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for their enjoyment, to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons. Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done. For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling. I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else who may find value or enjoyment in that very material. If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way you are happy and so is everyone else. Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books. Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to, as their purpose as a repository of knowledge would be defeated. Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion and deny them access to a story they wish to explore.
1650	4627	2	3	I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read. If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books that contain harmful stereotypes. There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay, not understanding the impact of the lyrics. Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories or images that can be demeaning. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all before placing it on the rack. The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies that are safe for all audiences. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw and parents can have peace of mind. In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed by the content they provide to the public.
1651	4628	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Many people will answer this question differently. I feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries. Allowing censorship in libraries is an intrusion of our rights. It contradicts freedom of the press. If someone wants their opinion to be read they should have that right, as the press is a primary vehicle for sharing ideas. I also feel censorship in libraries goes against freedom of speech. What is writing, but written speech? If someone wants to say something, they should be able to say it. If a mute person wants to get a point out, they should be able to do so by writing, and libraries are a repository for such expression. What some people consider offensive, others may not. If someone finds a particular book offensive, they should simply not read it, but they should not have the power to remove it for everyone else. The very foundation of a free society is the ability to access a wide range of ideas, and libraries must uphold this principle without interference.
1652	4629	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. This quote says it all, if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive. Books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader, and if not that books are for informational purposes. Not everybody will have the same views of one book as someone else does, so it would be unfair to not be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you to. Personally I like to read books that interest me, as I can assume most do everyone else. Generally to keep my attention, I like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot. I realize that some people would find this offensive and not acceptable for children, but I consider myself a good kid now and I am not negatively affected by those books I read. When I was a kid in fifth grade, I read a book far beyond what most fifth graders read. This book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but I was mature enough to handle them. Just the other year, the librarian, whom I stay in constant contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf. I told her no, with my reason being that I found it to be a very interesting book! I would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessible because of some vulgar language, because what it comes down to are just words that express heavy emotion. Many books such as, the dictionary or encyclopedias are used for informational purposes. These books can also be accessed by children. I myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'. Does that make it justifiable to remove? Even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them. When I was a freshman in high school, my English teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved. She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students. Books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some uptight adults think it is offensive, when in all reality they teach great morals and lessons for the youth. If you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about theirs. The same idea can go with any topic in the world today. Somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite. This is the issue with taking books off the shelves. One person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. My personal opinion is that a book is a book and people are going to interpret them differently. So if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone. There is no point! If someone shouldn't read that book then they simply should not choose to read it. The answer is as simple as that. When it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way, because they want a book removed from the shelf. Most people are offended by something and usually not everybody is offended by the same thing, which makes this issue impossible to deal with. There is only one answer to this question of: Should the library be censored? The answer is no, just let it be. The book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it. In the end of it all a book is just a book, and its value is determined by the reader, not a censor.
1653	4630	2	3	Have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't want your child or any young one to pick up and read? There are several books in the library that young children should not read. I don't believe that a certain book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possible things that could be done is; move those books to a higher shelf, designate a certain area for those books, or put an age limit on those books. The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your child's, or any other child's hands is to move those books to a higher shelf. Doing this will keep those books out of your child's sight and reach. That will keep them out of children's hands, and prevent them from reading them without needing to ban the material entirely. The next possibility to keep offensive books out of your child's or any child's hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. Doing this will provide a 'barrier', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. You would also know where those books are so that you could make sure they don't go to that area, allowing other patrons to still access them. The final possibility to keep offensive books out of your child's or any other child's hands is to put an age limit on those books to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. This would make the children have to be a certain age before they can check them out, preventing them from reading them without imposing a full removal. These are a few possibilities that could be used to keep offensive books out of children's hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading, while still maintaining access for a mature audience.
1654	4631	2	3	Many people have different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe to be true or not true, or very important to them, also called freedom of speech. Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it may be appropriate. I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then the author of the quote was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropriate it may be as long as they are along the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and violence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent to what should be freely available, and that line is often difficult to define.
1655	4632	2	3	What happened to using books and films as simple entertainment? Why are we now cautious of what our children pick off the shelf? Society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines are full of material no one should be reading or watching. Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, what do you hear? Mindless spewing of words linked together with curses and other garbage. Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment. There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who loved to read and listen to music. She was bright but shy, and used books as her friends. Each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. The book looked used, for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly detached. She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind caught a hold of a world she didn't know. After reading the book, she was filled with guilt. It wasn't a good book, but a book that was laced with a harmful message. This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know. So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort? The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely intended for the piece of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude. However the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different. When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down, or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet, the real question is; what about our children? How do we keep them safe from offensive literature? And what about music? Or movies? Remember the old black and white films? How, no matter what the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black. Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message. What about the other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form or racism, and/or sexual content. Personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun stop? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private? And what happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep these sorts of material away from them? Libraries should use major caution when printing labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc. Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group. Parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends. Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message. Should libraries take certain material off their shelves? I don't think so. However, be careful what you read or watch, for it might not please you. Use the internet as a source to find reviews on books and magazines, to see how well it was rated and then decide whether it is an intriguing read or an amazing film. Have fun, but be careful and mindful of the content you choose to consume.
1656	4633	2	3	Books, magazines, and music should be removed if they contain something offensive to the person or the child. Books, magazines, and music can cause children or adults to have a big imagination, leading them as they grow to think that its a right way to do things. All these things that are not for a proper use should be disposed of where no children or adult have it in use. I believe that this can hurt people as they grow up or adults thinking its the right way to do things. Books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use. Books and magazines that have no material use and are used for pornography or something else should be taken off shelves. Kids and adults have a big imagination that could sometimes hurt others as well as family members. Books, magazines, and music provide inspiration, but it can also lead to people's distraction. These are ways that by sometimes not knowing, you hurt your loved ones because of what you see, read, or hear. This can then be the biggest effects on people. The supplies you get like books, magazines, and music aren't helping you and are causing more problems in your life; they should be taken off markets. Also, people sometimes decide to buy them because of what the pictures have in store for you on a good day. Another thing that causes them to be taken off shelves is the thought that you can get by looking and hearing and reading. These are all bad things for anybody to be reading or listening to. I believe that books, magazines, and music should be taken off because its nothing good for the brain and it doesn't help you in any way. Also, things that aren't used for good are not useful. In my opinion, I think that trashy books and music can sometimes take you to suicide or into making something crazy that later on you will regret. This is why none of those things are useful for a person or a child. In conclusion, I think that books, magazines, and music that are not useful should be taken off shelves, and we should be putting things that do help the mind. Things that are not resourceful for a person's mind should be put away. All these things lead to not having stability in life and committing wrong steps that take you into failure. Finally, I think that all unresourceful books, magazines, and music should be put away.
1657	4634	2	3	I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. First, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be censored or not. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable. Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. Some people may not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong. It is either your own responsibility or a parent's responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. So most children's movies and books are appropriate and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books and movies because those things are already in your life. It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age. The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastrous. The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove. I once read To Kill a Mockingbird, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature, and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devastating. You should look at your own life and think about what you find offensive. Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own responsibility to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music, and magazines. It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture.
1658	4635	2	3	Censorship in libraries is good in some ways. People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books. Things that offend people: for instance, a book about American history or natives and how they were treated so poorly. But almost anything now days offends people and its ridiculous. Either way, there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive. My experience with this situation: it really didn't bother me. But I was in a library glancing through a book and I read a paragraph and it had the word, 'nigger,' in it and I found it a little offensive. That word just really isn't nice. People like different books, movies, magazines, etc., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well I'm pretty sure some people find them offensive in some way. What some might find offensive, others might think different. Like in magazines, my aunt finds them offensive because of the bathing suit models in it for advertising a new swim suit or for advertising liquor. All together, just about everything is offensive to someone out there. If all the things that people found offensive were to be removed, then there would hardly be any books, movies, etc., and not only that, it would suck all together.
1659	4636	2	3	People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want. It is people's own choice what they read, watch, or listen to. They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books. They will only go somewhere else and do it. People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them. If others find that offensive then that is their problem. People make their own decisions and that is their right. I feel that if you tell someone that they cannot do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more. Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others; it will only mask it. Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others; they just won't do it in libraries. Every book, music, or movie will be offensive to some other person, and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read. It is just something that we will have to deal with. So I do not agree with censorship in libraries. It will only take away our right to read and view what we want, but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have, which is almost every book. Everyone feels that one book or another is offensive to them, and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries.
1660	4637	2	3	I do not think they should take certain books off the shelves; there are a lot of things out there that can be found offensive: gangs, politics, race, even school that small children go to. I can understand wanting to shelter your children, but you can't keep them from everything. Inner cities have gangs that write awful words on trains, buildings, and about anything they possibly can. And you can't just take that off the shelf. Politics can be the worst; during presidential elections they are always bringing up the color of skin and about everything they can find out about the other person. All of your kids watch this on TV. Race wars can get bad; people all around the world are fighting just because of the color of their skin. You can't hide from it either; it's an ongoing battle that will never be won and it will keep getting worse. I can't speak for other schools, but mine has a lot of little problems; little kids cussing, the older kids fighting, then there are the people that try to do good in school and get picked on for it. You can't hide your kids forever; sooner or later they will find out about these problems. If you want to help your kids, keep them off the streets because reading it in a book is a lot better than them seeing it in the real world. You have to prepare them for the problems ahead, and if you don't then they might get hurt a lot worse than by the little words in a book or a magazine or movies.
1661	4638	2	3	In the book Fahrenheit 451, all books get burned no matter what they contain, and the people are always sad and depressed about everything. Books are an important part of our lives, providing knowledge and escape. Some materials do need to be censored because they might offend some people who already have a hard time with being who they are without these things to add to the flame. However, there are some books that are being censored for little to no reason. There might be a rude or a misunderstood word that caused books to be unnecessarily censored. Censorship is important to libraries when used correctly and judiciously. We need books for many things, from learning to simply using up time. Similarly, music has been with mankind since the beginning, and movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what is new and interesting. These things have become as important to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out of our world will make it a darker place to live. Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if she had the right to get rid of a book that offended her, then everyone can too, and soon all of the books will be gone. We can try to be nice to everyone, but at some point something will insult someone no matter what we do or say. Do we need to get rid of everything for that reason? We must find a balance that protects without destroying our access to diverse ideas and stories.
1662	4639	2	3	What is censorship? Many would say it's a book without cuss words or it's a movie without racism. For me, I think censorship is covering up the truth and hiding reality from view. I don't think movies or books should be taken off the shelf because some people find them offensive. When a book uses a cuss word to show anger or simply use the word, I think that it's okay because isn't that what we hear in the world already? Now I know some people may not have grown up hearing foul words, but many of us have, and literature should reflect that reality. With movies, I think that if people have a problem with their children watching something bad or offensive, then they shouldn't let their kid watch it. That's what's wrong with people now a days; they don't want to take blame for things that go wrong in their lives. People use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like they're a good parent or that the world owes them something. When it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone too far with its portrayal of race, then censorship gets thrown around. Many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with. Though it's funny to see that race use those foul words among themselves but when it's in a book it's called racism. Or when a certain race is being made fun of or shown in a movie in a way that that race doesn't feel comfortable with, that movie is called racist. I feel that if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, then they should take it out of their own lives. Too many people try to control something, like censorship. For years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language. Why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school itself? I know kids in school use foul language all the time, even worse then the books we read. If adults would realize it's their kids they need to censor and not the books, then censorship wouldn't have become such a huge issue. People need to just realize that by censoring the books or movies doesn't make the offensive words or bad images go away; it just covers them up and prevents honest conversation.
1663	4640	2	3	Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive? I don't think that is right. That's just what one person thinks, and other people I'm sure won't think the same way. Just because one person thinks something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn a valuable lesson from that book. Also with music, movies, and magazines, well, you can get that everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have it in a library? A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school, and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need, then how are they supposed to get their work done? I'm sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be learning yet, but we are going to have to learn about it sometime, so why not now in a safe environment? Taking away music? Kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easily, and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble. So having music at libraries is just giving them a free and safe way to get it. Magazines you could just go to a store and get, but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them so having them at libraries would give them a way to be able to see them. As long as it is stuff that kids can see, then I don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there. So I think taking books, music, magazines, and movies away from libraries isn't a very good thing to do. Maybe they could make an adult area, and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there then they can look over it and see if it should. I can see some stuff getting taken away but not very much, and if you take all that away from a library then you don't really have much of a library anymore, just an empty building.
1664	4641	2	3	I think if material is offensive, it should not be available for kids until they are old enough to read it or listen to it responsibly. I think they need to be removed from shelves or put away in a restricted section. Because it can be hurtful and dirty for younger kids, and it could be easily prevented if they are removed from open shelves. I believe the magazines can be put away or put into their own special sections. Music or movies could be put in their own sections also, away from the children's area. Internet access at libraries could be blocked for certain websites that are not appropriate. Luckily, the time we live in has adults to prevent these things from happening. And there are people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff. This is what I think; it could be easily prevented just by putting them up or having them removed and taken off the main shelves. If they are offensive, remove them so we don't have to worry if our children are reading them or not, ensuring a safer environment for young minds to grow and learn.
1665	4642	2	3	Dear Newspaper, I would like to start off by saying that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are great for kids in libraries. It's great that kids have a place to go in their free time when they have nothing else to do or need a quiet place to read. But some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults, and we must be mindful of that. In high school, just walking down the hall you will find out more things than you would probably like to know. Many of them may not be appropriate, but whenever you walk into the library it's almost as if they are promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex through some of the available media. Books about drugs are okay to a certain extent, like if they are about medicinal drugs. But whenever they are talking about how drugs take the pain away and make everything better, that's when it's taken too far. Our kids and future kids do not need to be learning about these sort of dangerous things from a positive perspective. Alcohol is the same way. You see alcohol everywhere and kids are doing it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc. are promoting it basically. Our kids do not need to be learning about these sorts of things in a way that glorifies them. We need them to learn about the real dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what you do when you're drunk. Advertisements are the worst things that kids could be seeing, especially when they are on billboards, fronts of magazines, etc. Kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young and impressionable age. Kids should be persuaded to play outside and be in sports and have fun with the family or ride their bike. I feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people and harmful to children. Because maybe it is for the best that these things are taken off shelves, because maybe our kids will be healthier and live longer without being negatively influenced or under pressure about doing drugs and alcohol, etc. Sincerely, @PERSON1.
1666	4643	2	3	I am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries. Some people think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive. Those things might be offensive to them, but not to other people. So you have to look at it in not only your point of view but other people's point of view as well. I think they should not remove these things from the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view; like my mom, for instance, she likes vampire books and movies, but I like tragedy. See, everyone likes something different. They also have to think about the books we have from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM2, etc., which might be offensive to some people. Are we going to take those books out too? I mean if we took books, music, movies, magazines, etc., out for being offensive then we would not have any books, music, movies, magazines, etc., left. Everyone thinks something is offensive; some might think the same thing is offensive, some might think something different is offensive. We should not take books, music, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelves. I understand that people do not want their kids to see them or hear them. It is part of life though. You cannot take everything out to please one person, because it could make another person mad, and libraries should be a place for all perspectives.
1667	4644	2	3	Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go, sit down, drink a cup of coffee, and read a book or magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of their favorite music. But, some people do not use it as that. They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to themselves, perhaps while their children are away or after they have had a bad day, to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask ourselves why do people want to sit at a library and read. Why can't they just check out a book, CD, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library? I do not see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public library. That means they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at their stuff. Yes, I can see libraries requiring the person checking out a book to sign a letter or document, giving personal information such as a telephone number, address, or credit card number. The letter would state that they have a certain amount of time with the book and need to return it by a specific date or else they need to bring it back in to get it renewed, so the library cannot accuse anyone of stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer. Most places have what they call late fees. Normally, if someone has a late fee then you are not going to get that book back because they do not want to pay it, so I feel as if by having their credit card number, the library can just keep charging their account and get the money that way for the late fees. Otherwise, they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they receive in the mail from the library in the trash. I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never-ending process with certain people because some of them just do not care. Yes, the internet would be a little different because not everyone has money to get the internet at their house. I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying; I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junky. My ideas, to me, are good ideas and I feel like we can put libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1 by implementing these practical measures.
1668	4645	2	3	People find things offensive every day. It is just a matter of life. Some people have a right to feel offended for some reasons, but they really cannot control it from happening. It is just something that has occurred for thousands of years. And people have slowly begun to deal with it. So therefore, I believe that books and other materials that are found offensive should not have to be taken down because it offends someone, because taking it down could offend someone else. What I am really trying to get across is that no matter what, not everyone will be happy. Life is filled with mixed society and emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing. Also, it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material because they did pay for it and have a right to let people in society watch, read, or listen to it. Thus being said, I believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum. Such as racism; it seems as though racism impacts a lot of the country still today and will forever be an on-growing matter in problems around the @CAPS1. In conclusion, I believe that the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive because, like I said, everyone deals with it at one point, and not everyone can be happy. And some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, etc., rather than being racist or offensive as everyone jumps to conclusions about. And everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye, for we are all the same, but yet, still broken up among looks and culture, and understanding this is key to a cohesive community.
1669	4646	2	3	The libraries are made for everyone, from children to adults. There may be some things that should not be in certain areas or even in the place at all. With the libraries having all age groups of books there, there may or should not be some material in those areas for them to see, let alone that it may not even be there to begin with. Any age of children can pick up a material that may contain either offensive content or just some things that they should not see. I think that libraries should only contain materials that are appropriate for all age groups. This is my opinion why I think libraries should only have materials with appropriate images and words for all age groups. You do not know what your or someone else's child may pick up and read or hear. The best thing to do is have all appropriate materials and nothing else, ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for every visitor, young or old.
1670	4647	2	3	Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material. Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves. Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. Now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be removed from their shelves. Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. Say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading. Next thing you know your children will have that type of knowledge and you cannot do a thing about it. Offensive material are around little kids and parents do not even know. They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread. Material like that at the library can harm children's brains by brainwashing them. Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regrettable. Teens often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework. Then a person who is immature spots a book and begins to read. After that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. Teens can be influenced by anything and what is worse is that it can start at the library. Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. People like that are immature and could serve a real problem for the library. Once having that item in their grasp; they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. Offensive material could be easily stolen from a library; if these certain items were not at the library then rebels would not be stealing anything from the library. Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. I do not want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obscene materials. That is why I strongly believe that certain material such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries to protect the community and preserve the library's role as a safe and educational space for all.
1671	4648	2	3	Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading and whether it might be offensive. Instead of removing the offensive material, there should just be a clear warning label to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive by some. These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this include when we watch the news, where we might see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's fundamental right to read what he or she wants. Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with the content. This simple step can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read a summary or review and just take it home, they may later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains such material, and can then make an informed decision on whether or not they still want to read it. There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a prominent warning label on the book or movie case to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material, similar to the rating system for films. Either of these ideas could be an effective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be offensive. Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out beforehand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it, thus balancing access with informed choice.
1672	4649	2	3	Censorship in libraries today, I believe, is not a big problem. But many would disagree with that. Books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age. They can give us facts about a certain topic that we might not find anywhere else. Everyone has their own definition of offensive. I believe that it is not only up to the library to rate the books, movies, and magazines as offensive but it is also up to the participants using these resources to decide for themselves. For many kids, no matter what age, they only rent books from a library for two main reasons: pleasure and projects. To censor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see what's inside of it, often making the forbidden material more appealing. For the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre. If someone wanted to rent a book, and it was not appropriate for them to read, then the librarian or teacher could restrict that book from them. For projects, such as for school, it would depend upon the librarian to censor the book to a child. But books are not rated such as movies are. So it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it. If they feel that it will not be appropriate for some, then they could give a suggestion to censor it. Movies and books are different in many ways. Books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading. Movies, on the other hand, create a visual image right in front of your eyes. No matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give, it still does not compare with the direct visual picture of a video. Movies are rated today as to the age of a person, and they say why they are rated as such. Movies rated above the PG-13 level are most of the time not held in libraries. They can still be censored if they create too vile of an image, but that is ultimately up to the one who watches it. Music is a major part of each one of our lives, and without it the world would be a much different place. Everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music, and most of the time sticks to it. Music, like movies, is also rated by the content of the song. If it has a word or two that should be censored, then it is most likely already labeled 'explicit'. I think that music, just like movies, should not be able to be censored, because they are already rated accordingly. Some books, magazines, and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone. And even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present. Books can be a magical place for children, as well as adults, to go and create their own world. To censor a book, movie, or magazine would be taking away that chance for someone to enjoy life just a little bit more for that small moment in time.
1673	4650	2	3	My opinion on this subject is that it's not a simple right or wrong issue. This is a very interesting question, and I'm going to tell you why I think the way I do. I'm for it and against it, as there are valid points on both sides. Okay, some people like different things and other people don't agree on it. That's just how things work. If a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it, I would not want my kid to be around that, and that's what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offended. I totally agree on that point. It's similar with cigarettes. Kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see. Once again, I would want to remove that from the shelves to protect children. There would be so many conflicts if this happened on a large scale. Everyone likes different things. So I think everyone is going to get offended by taking things away that looks offensive towards them. This goes from kids to adults. Every age would be bothered by this kind of widespread censorship. Now this is my against view on this subject. This would make me very mad if I admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offended by it so they take it away from the people that like that object. All this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad. That's not how it's supposed to be. We all have our opinions. We all like different things. We all have to get over it if we don't like something or don't get along with it. That's something we have to take in and suck it up, as dealing with differing views is part of life. So on this subject I'm for both sides. I see it both ways because it has good and bad aspects. People are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear, as it is an unavoidable part of life.
1674	4651	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found inappropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this. For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books to begin with, so their collections are already limited. For example, say one library might have action novels but not thrillers while another library has thrillers but not action. If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores, limiting access for those who rely on libraries. Second reason being that kids would not necessarily get into these kind of books if it was inappropriate, unless they're given approval by parents or are actively seeking it out. If these materials were to still be on shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read it, unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first. Sure it would make the library more kid-friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from everyone only because of a few bad words or a controversial idea. Lastly, some adults would be upset by the removal of some books that they enjoy or find valuable. Some books that are intended for mature audiences would be better off staying in the library for those adults. If they were to remove these books, adults would then have to find a book online or in a bookstore, which is not always feasible. So censorship, to me, is not going to make any positive difference and may even cause harm. If this continues, it could lead so far, that the libraries would have to be closed due to lack of diverse materials that attract readers. Take my word for it. In conclusion, don't let censorship take over our libraries and diminish their role as centers of knowledge and exploration for all.
1675	4652	2	3	Censorship to most people means much more than the average multi-syllable word. It means giving up the right to say and think however you want. To most, this idea is not a good one. When one is censored, they are essentially giving up the right of freedom of speech. In this essay I will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries. One reason censorship should not be allowed in libraries is the lack of freedom of speech. Decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was allowed to practice their right to speak freely, the idea of censorship was not in the plan. As Americans, it is our right to speak and write however we want without repercussions, however offensive or non-offensive the material may be. As Americans all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another. Does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves? Absolutely not. Freedom of speech is our birth right and we should be allowed to say or write anything without being censored. '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson. Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book off the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone else also has that same right. As previously stated in the paragraph above, it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive. If that was the case, I could find dozens of books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person could find hundreds of books that are offensive and so on. Just as Katherine states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelves for any of us.' And the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings. As an avid book reader, I couldn't even begin to describe all of the vocabulary words and new things I learn from reading one book. Just recently I read the book that was historically significant. As I was reading, I began to have a deep hatred of the main character. Later I found that the book was incredibly offensive to some. However, from reading it, the book provided much insight into a past era's life that I knew nothing about. It gave me a great deal of information that to this day, I use. The book made me reflect on myself and how many years changes people, Americans more specifically. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea. When one is censored they give up their right of freedom of speech, risk the removal of other books in general, and face a loss of opportunity to learn new things and gain different perspectives. Hopefully with this essay, I have persuaded you or at least informed you on the cons of censorship in libraries and why it should be opposed.
1676	4653	2	3	Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever come across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well that should never happen. If a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a separate, restricted area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that specific section, there should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see. Almost every day, children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example, when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them. The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old. So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young. That is why I believe there should be more censorship in every library to protect our future generations.
1677	4654	2	3	I think that every book in the world should be on the shelf. Because if it is offensive then don't read it. It is a lot better if you can go read any book you want to. And if they don't have that book then I guess you have to go get it somewhere else and some people wouldn't go through all that trouble for a book. Which means they won't know as much as they wanted to or could have known. We need smart people to know as much as their potential and as they want and can possibly know. But books are books; not everybody reads a lot of books. Let's say you wanted to know something about a truck, what do you do? You go find a book about it or get online or ask somebody that knows. How would anybody know anything about it if the person that built the truck didn't write a book telling you about the truck? You would have to take it apart and find out yourself which isn't very easy at all, and if you messed up that's not good. But if you had a book to go by it makes things a lot simpler most of the time. This is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf, so that if you need to know something and you want to learn you can read about it and find out what you want to know. Reading is one of the best ways to find out what you are looking for so that way nobody is telling you wrong. Plus, books are just good to read. All movies should be there too because everybody has the right to watch any movie they want, unless they aren't of age and no parent has to say it's okay for them to watch it. If it offends you, don't watch it. Magazines are good too; I read a lot of magazines and you can find out a lot about anything in a magazine, so yes they are good for learning and entertainment.
1678	4655	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive? No, I do not. My opinion is that the varieties of things found in our library are good. Most of it is very helpful information. Some people might not like some things because of what they have in them or on them, but most of it is history. You can't change that history. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magazine, they shouldn't read it or watch it. I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects. If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. Some people's views on that is totally different, but we can't help what people did in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it. Look for something else more interesting to you. I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me, or even bad. They have books over everything. Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information. They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other historical information. There are books over stuff that isn't even true, like fiction. I think people sometimes overreact on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Look at the cover and if it seems appealing, get it. But if not, don't waste time on complaining about it because then things can get out of control. That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc. in our libraries; mainly they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions on what should be available.
1679	4656	2	3	I think there should be no books taken off the shelves. Some things might be offensive to some people but other people might need those books for research, projects, etc. People need to read to understand why some people think that certain things are offensive toward others. Every book should be on a book shelf in a public library. Everybody has the freedom to choose for their self; let them decide if it is offensive to them and others. Maybe an author wrote a book about gangsters and their kids. Perhaps the author wrote the book to give you an inside look on somebody's life. We live in a very diverse world and there are going to be different outlooks on the world. The author could be writing the book to show you what that child went through during that point of life with killings and violence. That should not be offensive to somebody just because they are talking about killings and violence. Reading that book should let you see how that child grew up. The book could even change the minds of some of the child's parents who are in gangs. It could let them realize how it will have an effect on their child's life later on. I believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines. Through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you. Say if you are in a gang and you watch movies and read, you would find out what happens to the gang; it could change your thoughts. These books, movies, and magazines could show what is going to happen to you. Maybe directors and writers do these types of things to show you what will happen if you continue down the path in gangs and harmful clubs. Why should certain people get to choose if a book, movie, magazine, etc. is offensive to some people but not others? I think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelves. Let the people who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Even if libraries make a decision, somebody is going to get mad and upset. I do not think there is any way to solve an issue like this except letting people read and decide for themself. If they like the book, great; if not, then do not read it again or return the book. Nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody else; only you can do it for yourself.
1680	4657	2	3	Some children take books off the shelf that some older people can't read now a days because the print is too small or the content is difficult. Some people have taken books off the shelves and taken them home, only to return them broken or with pages torn out of them. This is a problem because it prevents others from enjoying or learning from those books. It is important for everyone to treat library materials with respect so that they remain available for the whole community to use. When books are damaged or destroyed, it limits the knowledge and stories that can be shared, which is a loss for all patrons who rely on the library for information and entertainment. We should all be more careful with the books we borrow to ensure they stay in good condition for future readers.
1681	4658	2	3	Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive. I have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if they censor stuff in a library, they should censor television as well. I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Everyday I see bad language that is not censored. I also have seen images that are not censored on regular television programming. The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library, so they are exposed to more there. So why not censor tv? I see things on tv that I won't see in a library, which shows the inconsistency. In my conclusion I would like to say I don't believe that libraries should censor their materials because the student will still find out about these things elsewhere. There are plenty of other places that are worse, like crime scenes. Crime scenes have blood and gore and a library would just have some bad language. These are my views and yours could be different, but I hope you consider this perspective.
1682	4659	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said that. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement. I have once read a book with very mature content; it was very vulgar and not suitable for my age or maturity level at the time. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things. If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregnancies, drug usage, and multiple other factors that are negatively effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media's mature content. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these books though; we should just keep them out of the children's sections in libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere, like a bookstore for adults. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or a restricted section in the libraries. A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media, but she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is too adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it, and let others make their own choices.
1683	4660	2	3	We have all been to a library at some point in our life. Have you ever been looking around and seen something that might have been offensive, or something you didn't agree with? What if you had the chance to have it taken off the shelves for good? Or, what if someone else had the choice to? Would you allow them to do so? In my opinion, I would say no. Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves, just because it might be offensive to them, or their way of life. I say, if you do not like it, do not look at it; it is as simple as that. For example, what if you were into rap, or the hip hop culture, and someone finds that offensive? Would you give them the right to keep it from you? Or, would you really want to do that to someone else? Lets say you are a christian, and an atheist finds the Bible offensive, or untruthful, so he has it taken off the shelves. Does that sound fair to you? If someone was to not like a certain topic or culture, or finds it offensive, all they would have to do, is simply stay away from it and let others enjoy it. The point is, if we all were to take something off the shelves that we didn't like, there would eventually be nothing left for anyone to read. Respect what other cultures and ways of life do, and stay away from what offends you personally. Would you like someone to have what you like taken off the shelves? I would not, so you should not do that to other people; we must live and let live.
1684	4661	2	3	It seems today we attempt to censor everything, but are we going too far? Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole? In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed that line. A library is, essentially, an incredibly valuable resource to each generation. In some cases it still is, but when books are being withheld due to the fact that it might offend someone we are holding people back from the knowledge they could gain from the work of literature itself. We attempt to placate everyone in today's society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct. If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained from history. Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not- and very well may never truly be- politically correct. People take umbrage to certain words and consequently some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves. After this is done, what have we really accomplished? Have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history? That is debatable, but by the same token, in school we must learn about the Holocaust despite the fact that it upsets many people. We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again. So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but affected the entire world should we not learn about our own faults in history? The times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now. Has it really helped us? No, for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it. Napoleon once said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten and sanitized? If everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left on our library shelves. For if one person is allowed to say what is and isn't acceptable then others will partake in this as well. It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything, until no books remain. So, essentially, by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be. We are forcing them to be ignorant of society's problems and the hard lessons of the past. In the end we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it? I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource that should not be diminished by fear.
1685	4662	2	3	When people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read. Teachers use the libraries for many different things. One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics. Another is for books on certain people or events. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school. So what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed? I'll tell you what it is. Kids watch movies in class all the time. Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very insightful and helpful for learning. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks that it is too bad for children in say elementary it should be banned from that schools library, but for high schoolers chances are they have heard or seen worse things already. So with saying that movies should stay in the libraries of high schools but not all should stay in the elementary's libraries. Books are another good resource if used correctly. They help kids in history learn about old war heroes and past events that shaped our world. Some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though. Like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs or explicit violence. They should be taken off the open shelves, put behind the counter; and if someone really needs a book about them like for medicine purposes to become a doctor then all they have to do is ask for it specifically. Magazines are good for a couple of different nice things. One thing is projects. If you have to do a project over something like food and can't use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures and ideas. Another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment during free time. Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of looks or if a book is too hard to read you could get a magazine with shorter articles. So in reality some things should be kept and others taken away based on context and age group. People spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and education and that won't change either. So I guess i'm half and half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials, depending on the situation and the audience.
1686	4663	2	3	My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear such as younger children, or people that don't agree with having to listen to things such as: bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these things. Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored. I recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding Osama bin Laden. I find that these images may serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, can see horrifying images that some people might think they shouldn't be exposed to. Even as adults people don't necessarily agree with it. Adults might see what's in the news and could find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure their children should have, it would not be such a good thing for their kids to be hearing. I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I casually switch the raido from am to fm as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top one hundred song as I had expected, I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of Osama bin Laden to a talk radio show host. The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the womans' comments. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for Osama bin Laden to kill thousands, but we can't kill him argument. The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me. The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country, and were cursing at her. News like the death of Osama bin Laden isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well. Another instance when I was exposed to some information that might not have been well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of Muslim belief. The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the Muslim faith were born in America, and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in Tennessee. Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities, and homeless people in Tennessee there were people shouting at the im protest to leave, and to go back to where they came from. When people hear things about this in the news it can be very offensive, because although it might be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to effect someone, it can easily effect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these peoples' opinions and might take that very offensively, because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong. I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people might not want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they might not be comfortable with.
1687	4664	2	3	I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library. If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries. If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it in the first place? I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library. If someone dosen't like it then they don't have to get it or read it; they can simply choose another book. I beleive that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store, but why would they waste the money in buying the book only to remove it later. The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books. Everyone has different views also, and what one person finds objectionable, another may find valuable. If anyone could remove books from libraries then there wouldnt be any books left in the library. A book is a book. Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries. There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because its been published so it's already open to the public and available for those who wish to seek it out.
1688	4665	2	3	I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time but do you see them trying to get what ever it is that made them fell like that removed from everywhere? I have been offended by cartoons before but you don't see me crying about it you just have to suck it up and go on with life. Cartman from the tv show South Park is the most offensive characters on that show. He uses every offensive language known to mankind and targets various groups with his insults. He makes fun of all the racees, he says he hates everyone equally. But still you can't stop it that is like trying to get a dog to be a cat it just wont happen. It is also like trying to get rid of racecism, a monumental task that cannot be solved by simply removing a single piece of media. That is what I think about finding something offencive; it is a personal reaction that should not dictate universal availability.
1689	4666	2	3	When you walk into your local library there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc. You have different types and styles of books. There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more. Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence for developing minds. When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced in a negative way. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision with serious consequences. Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated R or NC-17 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store where access can be better controlled. Items like these are meant for adults only, who can process their content with maturity. We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them, like a locked cabinet or a high shelf. The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change in their attitudes and behaviors. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it, one that uplifts rather than degrades. I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change for the better. Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place, a safer and more positive one for everyone.
1690	4667	2	3	Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you might not want your children to read at a certain age. But there also can be things that you do want them to read when they are older and more mature. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older and could handle it. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines and the context in which they are presented. If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine, to some people that might not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad; it is highly subjective. I am sure that there might be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it could still be offensive to others based on their personal experiences. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that would be offensive to more than a small group of people. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and might have offensive material in it here and there, but it is historically accurate. The second book is also well written but might not all be there; the whole story might not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that may have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend, providing the full picture. Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they might not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life, than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective and their truth. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing that broadens your understanding. Even with the offensive material, books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others, which is why a one-size-fits-all approach does not work. I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored to prevent the spread of misinformation. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group, not banned entirely. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored for everyone. A book that may have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective and upbringing; if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive instead of limiting others' access. Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to might not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad, to others it can be part of their life or a valuable learning experience. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it, I would want it to be read, seen, and heard in its entirety. Censorship might be good for some and bad for others depending on their individual needs and sensitivities. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending and avoids difficult topics, then maybe censorship is good for you. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction, then censorship is not for you, as it compromises the integrity of the narrative.
1691	4668	2	3	If they are offensive they should be taken off the shelves because little kids would not understand them. And I think that they should not be there in the first place because almost everybody goes to the libraries. If I found them offensive they would probably get shut down or whoever put them there would be fired. The kids should not see them or know about them at all. The offensive books, music, movies, and magazines are not meant to be found in libraries that kids go to. I think that most people would be mad at the schools or the libraries because they had them. And most parents would go talk to the people that put them there. But if that happened to me, if my kid came home with one of the offensive magazines or anything, I would ask them where they got it and then go to talk to the people that run the place. And most of the people that find those things would be mad, but it is not the kids' problem that someone did that. And the first thing they should do is have a rating for people @NUM1 or older on the books, movies, magazines, and music if they are in the libraries. They should not be where the kids go and read books or do anything like that. They should be where the people that are @NUM1 or older can get them, but I still think that they should not be there at all. But if the offensive materials are in libraries, people should take the libraries to court over the offensive books, movies, magazines, and music to ensure they are removed.
1692	4669	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do believe so. The reason why is because there can be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in certain places like the library or stores that can involve offensive stuff, such as violence or other bad things. A lot of things can influence the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid sees a movie that involves violence. One reason I think that books should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive is because what if the reader is reading the book and they find a word that offends them? Or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff? Or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff. A lot of things can just occur while reading a book. And many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about their religion, race, or anything that involves their personal life. That's why I think books should be removed off the shelf, so people will not get offended. Another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or their parents rent the movie, then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about. The kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don't really realize what their kids are watching, so it's important for them to learn and watch for their kids. In movies anyone can see a lot of bad things that can affect anyone or can offend anyone. So I think that they should not have certain movies on the shelves that can harm or offend certain families or parents, especially their kids. Magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people. Whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else. It's either talking about singers, people divorcing, violence that occurs around the world, arrests, or it could even have bad images that anyone could see, which would be something bad, especially if a little kid picks up a magazine that has something bad inside. That's why they shouldn't have magazines that have bad stuff in public, or adults shouldn't buy certain type of magazines because they never know what their child can expect to see. So there is a lot of reasons why I think that people should remove certain books, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive stuff. All around the world you will see stuff that can offend you or anyone else just by seeing something on a movie, by listening to a song, or even by reading a book. It's just not a good idea of having stuff out there like that in certain places, like the library, stores, or anywhere else, especially if there is people that take it really offensive when they see a title of a book that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words. It's just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people. What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive? People should ask themselves that before they read a book or see a movie, so they will decide whether or not they should have books, magazines, or music removed from the shelves to maintain a respectful environment for everyone.
1693	4670	2	3	Yes I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed. They should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior. In order to keep the objects from being found from children is to set them in a different area, somewhere children are unable to reach, like in high areas such as the top of the shelf, or the closet, maybe the attic. For better safe keeping, place the certain objects you feel that can give children bad ideas in a personal safe where no one is able to get things out. It is important for some items to be seen, listened to, or watched for older people. For example, books can provide pictures for children to do things that aren't right in their current age. Music can talk about stuff that that person done, and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it. For the magazines, they show articles of rappers, actors, and other famous people doing something wrong, showing a bad example for the child. Now for the materials, they should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look at because the materials sometimes harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital. From experience I have touched or took some material I shouldn't have messed with and the outcome wasn't good. From that experience I've learned not to touch items I know not to mess with. That's why it is important to keep certain items from children because the outcome may not be what you wanted. Serious actions might come from the objects, and later on come from the same child that either listened to, saw it, or looked at it, so make sure the items are safe from children's hands to prevent any potential harm or negative influence.
1694	4671	2	3	I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all. One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience. I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in are being made fun of or rejected. It @MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion @MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and constant arguments. Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems; it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all Arabians are dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'. Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they @MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children committing these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for releasing this material to children, so the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors if it is contained within your library to ensure a safe and appropriate environment for all patrons.
1695	4672	2	3	Many people I know would be very upset if there wasn't anymore books on the shelves of the library. I think there should be books that are offensive; who wants to read a book that is boring and not exciting? The libraries should have labels on the books so when people go to check them out the books would have a label that says this book @MONTH1 not be right for certain people and may contain bad language. That's just an example. There should be adult and children sections in the library, maybe sections for every type of books like murder and mystery. That also goes for the movies, music, and magazines. I love going through the books in the library; you never know what to expect out of a book, and having a clear organization and labeling system would allow everyone to find materials suitable for their age and interests without unnecessary restrictions.
1696	4673	2	3	"Do you think we should have censorship in our libraries? I say no because if we had censorship then there would be very few good books, magazines, and movies left to choose from, because in this world today everyone gets offended by something. For example, in action, horror, and comedy films there could be blood, violence, and cursing, which sometimes are elements that make a movie good. Even in some books there is cursing and violence. Some novels even seem provocative. For example, in ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" the book repeatedly uses the n-word. Even some magazines like fashion, sports, and some car magazines are seen as provocative. And if I walked into my local library and saw all my favorite movies, books, and magazines not on the shelf, I would never go back again. I'm not trying to say we should put adult books in the elementary school library, but in the public library it is okay to have books like that. Could you imagine a library with censorship? It would be practically empty, devoid of the diverse materials that make a library a valuable community resource."
1697	4674	2	3	Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are children's books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that might be inappropriate for their age. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy. What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's personal opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well. Unfortunately, there are some books that might cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a story. Many children take in every word and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories. I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a children's section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropriate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read. A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy, defeating the very purpose of a library.
1698	4675	2	3	No, I do not figure that we should have censorship in libraries. I say that there is some material for adults, teens, and children. The children aren't going to want to read the adult books and the adults aren't going to want to read the children's books. The teens aren't going to want to read the children's books but they might want to read the adult books and that's okay. They will be adults soon and they might be interested in more mature subjects. There is nothing wrong with that. If the parents do not want their teens or children reading that kind of material then they should go with them to the library and make them get parental approval before checking out the books, magazines, or whatever it is they want to read at the time. Movies are the same; there are different materials for each age group. Some age groups might be interested in other age groups' material and that's okay. It doesn't mean it's wrong, it just means they're maturing more and are interested or curious. Let them explore; they will figure out for themselves if the material is right for them or not, which is a natural part of growing up.
1699	4676	2	3	OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!! Did you ever think about why students read what they are reading now? They read books about sex, guns, and many more topics because they think it's exciting, but guess what, it's not! The authors who make those types of books want you to buy them because they want your money, but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things. I think that books like that should be removed because you don't want your child to grow up reading those type of books, and then when they have kids they wouldn't want the same for them. Many parents don't care what their children read as long as they are reading; it's fine with them, but it's not fine, it's very wrong and I wouldn't expect a great writer to use bad language. Also they think it's okay to do that! That's why kids act the way they do now is because of books, movies etc. I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores where adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I don't think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they don't want to learn that stuff, but some of them do and I don't think that's right at all. That's why kids should read a very good book and don't judge a book by its cover, focusing on quality literature instead.
1700	4677	2	3	Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library itself. Parents have different views on books, music, etc. One parent might not have a problem with one book that has a few curse words in it but another parent might think it is not something they want their children to pick up and read, fearing they might later on start using that kind of language. But if the libraries censor that book and it is taken out, it would make a big impact on people because, what if somebody really likes that book but since someone complained about it, it is now not allowed in the library. The library would lose patrons because of books being censored. Everybody might not agree on different subjects and they would want a certain book, music, movie or magazine censored. But if one person complained and the book is no longer there, does that mean the libraries are going to be empty from now on? A person who does not have children might say, 'How can one little joke hurt?' A joke not suitable for a child under twelve to read, hear, or watch. But a parent might get upset that their child is hearing, reading, or even seeing these things and might ban it from the library. When a student needs to go to the library to look up their topic they must research for school and cannot find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has had it removed. The student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the internet. What if their teacher said that they needed more than one source and all their information cannot just be off the computer; they need a book, magazine, or newspaper source also. But since that topic they are researching about has upset someone, they are not able to find the information they are looking for. Yes, there are some books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not for children under twelve or even pre-teens to teens. That is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups. Still, how do these sections keep our children from reading something inappropriate? Parents should know when they come into a library they should look for signs on the walls; if a library does not have signs that tell them what kind of section they are coming into, all they have to do is grab a few books off the shelves and read the inside cover or outside to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of that section. It should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children's section has toys and puzzles in them and children-themed walls. Censorship would not only get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but it would also make our libraries empty. A lot of people have different points of view; his view might be different from her view. From teens to young adults, teachers to children, parents to non-parents, everyone is different and no one person can speak for the whole world. This is precisely why censorship would not work in our libraries.
1701	4678	2	3	A lot of people have huge debates over what they think is appropriate for children and teens to be reading, watching, and listening to; in this topic there will be opinions discussed and logical explanations to what some people think is the proper things kids should be exposed to. First, kids should not be watching rated R movies or even PG-13 if it has vulgar content, sexual content, violence, and etc. Even though some parents allow this, these movies and magazines can still have a huge impact on the child and possibly on how they act in his or her future, shaping their understanding of social norms and relationships. Secondly, children still have a good number of movies for them to watch and learn from that can better themselves for their education, career, etc., including many animated features and educational documentaries designed specifically for younger audiences. Finally, teens and young adults exposed to this genre of movies, books, music, or any other media based entertainment are more likely to make destructive decisions than a teenager who doesn't. Although this is not always the case, it does increase the chances of wrong decisions and it does have and influence on the younger minds, which are still developing critical thinking skills. In conclusion, young adults, teens, and children should not be able to watch media that contains vulgar content, sexual content, violence, etc, without parent supervision and permission, as this guidance is crucial for their healthy development.
1702	4679	2	3	In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read. For instance movies, are we going to go let a five year watch a rated R movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it, such as those featuring explicit fashion or violent content. Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they may not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for, and descriptive passages can be just as impactful as images. Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated R film called 'Child's Play'. After watching all three of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again. Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible. To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section. This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well, ensuring clear boundaries. I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas? Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up. There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the child. If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is. Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is. Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever. Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things, but rather manage access to them responsibly.
1703	4680	2	3	Have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say, 'Wow! That's inappropriate!' If so, I am sure your not alone. Just the other day I was in the library. There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now avalible for rental. I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive, filled with graphic imagery. How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this? How does this affect the minds of our country's youth? My thought on this topic is clear, although I am sure I'd recieve some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter. I do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere? You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it, simply seeing the promotional displays can be disturbing. I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material, away from general view. Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are CDs. New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. Even the covers of some CDs should be removed for the good of the public, as they can feature suggestive art. It's interesting how these things just slide by the library. I once saw a young by renting a CD that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover! No one stopped him or questioned his age. Books are the same way. Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library. No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves for potentially offensive content. So, when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries? It is hard to say, but I strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this. I hope you'll join me in this epic battle for censorship, to keep our youth safe from such influences.
1704	4681	2	3	I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read Shakespeare or a classic novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action, genres that often explore darker themes. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others, pushing boundaries of taste. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: Borat to some people is very offensive due to its satirical content. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life and cannot appreciate different forms of humor. I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended, creating a cycle of criticism. Books about war to some people are too graffic, depicting the true horrors of conflict. But those books about war are probably books about history, seeking to educate rather than sensationalize. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like, a modern trend of seeking to sanitize collections. But back in the 1970's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read for entertainment or knowledge. I say leave the librarys alone and let people choose for themselves what they wish to read.
1705	4682	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today. Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences, often to provoke thought or challenge conventions. However, many do not, preferring more traditional and respectful discourse. All authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them, balancing creative freedom with public responsibility. If libraries accept offensive types of magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children. Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a sperate section for adults, which is a sensible approach. Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way, perhaps with a label. Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong, a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials seperate, applying consistent guidelines. Those who borrow anything at the library also have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge if they find its content concerning. By sticking to this method, offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them while remaining available for others. Items containing vulgar language is unjust to most, as it can be disrespectful and coarse. There are still the majority, however, who engage in the oppertunity to view these materials for various personal or academic reasons. Everyone does have the right to do what they wish but, from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity as well as respect in all media. No matter our color, size, looks, or personalities, we are all created equally as our constitution says. Therefore, we should only view what would be considered just to all, promoting kindness and understanding. After all, everyone wishes to be treated kindly, right, and our choices in media should reflect that universal desire.
1706	4683	2	3	Public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people, as their fundamental purpose is to serve the entire community. I feel very strongly about my statement, because everyone in this world is different. Many people have different interests, religons, and customs, and a library's collection should reflect that rich diversity. If we took out certain books, and music from the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library, turning it into a place that only caters to a narrow set of tastes. But if we had different sections of books, music, etc., people would be able to find what they want/need more easily, and no one would have to worry about getting offended by accidentally encountering material not meant for them. It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended, as this would impose a single viewpoint on a diverse populace. A truly public institution must strive to represent a multitude of voices and perspectives.
1707	4684	2	3	People in this common era have different appproaches to the idea of libraries. Some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free, a sanctuary for the mind. Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very innapropriate, filled with content they find objectionable. These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument about the role of such institutions in our communities. People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book. There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing. some books, although good, can be innapropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills over into public discourse. Parents think the library is encouraging the check-out of innapropriate books, but this isn't all that true. It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you. They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to have the material available. It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background, which highlights the subjectivity of such judgments. I think that these so-called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries. There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive; so why take them down? I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections. This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much innapropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end, fostering a more cooperative environment. People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy and knowledge. Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so. Why complain? Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it. Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child, a sense of wonder and possibility.
1708	4685	2	3	Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of 'Parental Advisory' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen can be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive, reflecting the social norms of their time. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem; they are products of their era. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society. Take the book 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', written by Mark Twain, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time, language that is now recognized as deeply harmful. Back when Mark Twain wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read and discussed with proper context. Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a child of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on television. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a child nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their child watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the child's reaction. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay, and the rating system should be respected. And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white 'Parental Advisory' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the CD, digital download, or whatever their child is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their child to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage', as some would call it. So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', 'The Catcher in the Rye', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' '1984 the movie', or 'Child's Play' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a child or it gives their child nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like Eminem, Nirvana, and other controversial artists are not suited for their children. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a child of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their child view it in the first place, not the fault of the material itself.
1709	4686	2	3	What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is why parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to, applying the same vigilance to all media sources. Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in many cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion about what is best for the community. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book; they are drawn to stories and images meant for them. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer, which is a natural part of growing up. I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want? The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library? It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore? The responsibility ultimately lies with guidance. Another issue is banned books. Many of them are classics that past generations have read in school. Why would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? Why would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, 'Why would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' Many of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the nineteenth century, or the early twentieth century. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it? We should learn from it instead. Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section labeled for adults. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer; the tools for supervision are readily available. I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn, balancing access with appropriate guidance.
1710	4687	2	3	Have you ever read something that you have found offensive, upsetting, or has made you mad? Do you think that there are certian books that shouldn't be allowed in a library because of its content? A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines these days contain things that are hurtful to society or protray bad images of certian social groups, sparking debates about their place in public institutions. In today's society there are many different groups of people and a lot of them have thier own opinions on how they view different things. To me, when I think about a library, I think about how all different ages of people go to them, how there are many different groups of people there, and about the types of books that are in there. Taking this all into concideration, I believe that everything should be allowed in public libraries but I do think that there should be seperate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be only for adults. I think this because if you take away all the things that are 'bad' or 'offensive' to you, you could be displeasing those who find these things interesting or enjoy reading them. In this case, people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting, defeating the library's core mission. By saying these things, seperating the books into age groups is a good thing because then the younger children who are running around the library will not pick up something that they should not be looking at. I also believe that is would benefit them because then if someone comes into the library looking for a book but does not really know what to do and they go to where their age group would be; then they can see everything that is recommended for them, making their visit more productive and enjoyable. From my own experience, I know that I have read some books and looked at some magazines that I probably should not have looked at because I was too young. This does not mean that they need to take them off the shelves but maybe that they should be placed in an area where someone my age will not be able to find them easily. So the next time you go to the library and see something that is offensive to you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting, and a public library must strive to serve them all.
1711	4688	2	3	Yes, there are a lot of books out there that have graphic and sexual phrases, and there are a lot of concerned parents out there that are worried about what the libraries are possibly letting their kids read. One good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas of the libraries, though that doesn't necessarily mean that the kid is going to listen to that sign. We all know for a fact that pornography will stay away from libraries and stay where it is at right now, so that's not an issue the parents should worry about. I think the libraries should be broken into sections. There's a kid section, a teen section, and an adult section, but I don't think that the adult section should be too far off from the teen section because when we say adult books or magazines everybody expects it to be one thing, porn. It should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it. There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to get to them you have to show the librarian some proof of age to be able to get into those sections, except the kid section. The kid section is a section that all kids can use, because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids. I think that with that kind of security it would let parents be able to be less stressed and worried for their child's safety and insecurity of the mind. There are tons of other ideas to explore to be able to try and keep books with some kind of censorship but most of them are off the wall and ridiculous. I think that music and movies shouldn't even be in libraries; just leave those to other stores. It's better to let stores deal with that than libraries. The librarian probably doesn't even know half the CDs that get checked out anyways, so it's best if you don't have those in there at all. Give some thought to these ideas that I just sprang at you. I personally think that having doors blocking access to certain books would be a great plan to use, because it would effectively block access to these areas from certain kids. Some other parents or people might have ideas of their own and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bulletin about them around the city or town to foster a community discussion on the matter.
1712	4689	2	3	Look it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a...harmful word. There has been many times when I have read a passage, whether it be a magazine article, a book or a newspaper, and I have come across harmful words. They may not all mean harm towards me, but towards other readers they could. People have their own opinions on different views, so a word or passage could affect me differently than say someone else. I don't think it's the materials; I think it's the reader's maturity level that makes a difference. That is how harmful words get changed into names and then the next thing you know, peers are calling other peers that word. For instance, the word 'wetback' in a biography book about the immigrant experience is okay to be there; it is when the reader interprets it the wrong way, and they think it is funny and cool to go around and call someone that word, especially a person of that race. That is when I don't think materials like this should be on shelves, but then again it goes back to the maturity level. These words or passages can become harmful to someone that hasn't even read it, but because someone that has took the initiative to start calling someone that word, or relating that passage to them. Books can, and are, a great reliable source for schoolers that are researching for class projects; I think it's the certain topics of books that get these words turned into harm. Books about certain races can cause name calling among a school just because they read it in a book and think it is okay; because the book described a person that way doesn't mean it's okay for the reader to start calling people by that word. Other topics like 'sex' in a book can be interpreted in the wrong way as well. Some teens think it's okay just because the characters in the book are doing it, then it's okay for them and their significant other to try it. Either way, with the book left on the shelf or taken off, it is still going to be a problem with name calling. So it's going to take something else than a material being removed from a shelf to find a real and lasting solution to this complex problem.
1713	4690	2	3	"Censorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is suitable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decisions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see. Firstly, people think that other people are incapable of deciding for themselves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The Harry Potter books were blocked because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of Wrath was banned because there was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it. Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express themselves. Lately they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called something inappropriate and offensive. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know what is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. The movie ""The Miner"" was a film that off the top of my head was showing a miner that had gone completely blood thirsty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could. Although, sometimes we need to see the things that people have in their heads. I know that I am going to be more careful when I am out. In conclusion, there is no real yes or no answer. There are always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide for themselves what they do and don't watch and read."
1714	4691	2	3	What race are you? What religion are you? What have you been taught? Almost anything like these could be considered offensive. So should these types of things be taken out of libraries? No, these types of things are everywhere. You just can't get away from them. Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials. For example the commercials for a certain gum with that overly clean woman, some people might consider that offensive. You might ask, 'why is that offensive?', well there might be a person who has a disease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath. That person might take offense to these commercials. Another example might be television shows, like certain reality programs. Some religious groups and just other races get offended by these types of things. Does that really mean we should get rid of them though? People everywhere are somehow offended by something; the world isn't perfect. Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen elsewhere. So what's the point? If you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world, everything would be crazy. There is no such thing as a perfect world; I believe if there was, people would go crazy. For example in the movie 'The Perfect Town,' the main character finds a town that is supposed to resemble 'The Perfect Society' or a utopia. In the town at first everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves. The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else. Also they help kids learn; if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life? So should these things go away or not? What do you think? The answer likely depends on your own perspective and experiences.
1715	4692	2	3	Is there a song that your parents wouldn't let you listen to when you were a child? When you sang this song did they yell at you and ground you because they had told you many times before that you weren't allowed to listen to it? How about a movie that you wanted to go watch because it was what everyone was talking about but it was rated R so you weren't allowed to watch it. That book on that shelf that you accidentally ran into while doing a research project, containing inappropriate language and terms. There is much media and books that are out there that parents wouldn't want their children to read. But over all there is the government who censors things going on around the world. Censoring can have good and bad qualities. In my experience I've noticed that people that know less tend to be more happy than people who know more. But if you are able to read and or watch these censored materials you would see the idea from a certain point of view, and maybe agree with the person. Most news is about things that are bad; rarely any good news comes around. For example if something were to happen in a remote location, where thousands of people were being used to test if lions liked to eat humans, the government would censor the news to the people in their country due to any reason. If there was a movie that was made that was racist against a certain group of people the government would probably censor it. Things that look bad tend to be censored. I've noticed that people who read censored material feel special because they read or saw something that wasn't supposed to be known by the rest of the population. A lot more freedom of speech would occur if censored material wasn't censored. People also tend to become mad when they find out that material is being censored because they feel like something is being hidden from them, which could be valuable information. In reading I have noticed that societies that practice censorship tend to have angry citizens. But on the other hand, if they believe that it's for the good of the society then they accept the fact that it's not good for them. People also want to be given the right to make their own decisions. In a censored civilization they have no idea what is going on outside their borders and are usually clueless or being lied to by their government. Censorship can have good and bad qualities. People tend to be offended when material is censored, but it's probably for the best for them. Hidden information could be good and bad but mostly bad; most people want to know the truth rather than a lie. Censorship is just bad in general; people should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch for themselves.
1716	4693	2	3	I somewhat agree with taking out books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material that could be offensive to someone, because it could be racial or it could be about something that isn't appropriate for children to read. I think it just depends on the topic, maybe one thing could be offensive to one person and not the other, so people should choose wisely what they read. It wouldn't be fair to take certain books from the shelves of libraries because people take different interest in different topics, so say one book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriate but another person thinks that book is fine, it wouldn't be fair to the other person to take that book from the shelves. But something that I do disagree with in books or magazines that is inappropriate is pictures and comics, because children shouldn't be allowed to have access to a book, movie, or a magazine that has that type of content in it. But also I think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first, perhaps by reading a summary or checking a rating, before they allow a child to read or see it. So it depends on what type of things are in the book, movie, or magazine. Basically it's up to the person, if they don't like the criteria in any of those things then they shouldn't look into it, and they certainly shouldn't remove the choice for everyone else.
1717	4694	2	3	Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookshelves if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers? I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote from the author, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the shelf, there would not be a variety of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten curious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book and form my own judgment. I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelves just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety of choices to explore for themselves.
1718	4695	2	3	Have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content? In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people. People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive. Although there is things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive. People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines. What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers. There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children. Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong. Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries. Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children. Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way. An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone. It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular. How does this pertain to offensive books? Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm. Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose. Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet. Protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns. Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about. The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds. Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book. A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable. Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read. Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them. Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been. I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring. Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading. There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today. Even thought they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book. Tom @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are famous for writing gory, violent, gruesome books that would be qualified as offensive to others. You have the choice not to read them or to read them. Books that deal with slavery @MONTH1 also be found offensive like the book @CAPS1. It does a superb job at describing how things were during slave times. Books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the book shelves because they are essential to everyday people and reading. They are required by some to enjoy a good book and to understand the full spectrum of human experience.
1719	4696	2	3	Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about whether we should take books off the shelf and etc. People have different views on different things. Books, books give a different form of learning to different people. I personally don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Everyone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while for enjoyment or to gain knowledge on a specific subject. Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxes you in different ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those people. It influences you to get motivated, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game with its fast tempo and powerful lyrics. When I sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause I have the patience to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have different ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get straight to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you already know, which makes the learning process more efficient for me. Magazines are helpful too they have short articles that get straight to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out a lot by summarizing complex topics. So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you a lot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certain point. It is up to other people to decide whether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in different ways not just one way but many ways too, such as for relaxation or artistic inspiration.
1720	4697	2	3	I am a student from @CAPS1. I wanted to let you know that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the schools library and the public library as well. The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books. Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading. I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do. I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn, which would be a great loss for the community. To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me. One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like. I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only there choice and not everyones. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library. If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school's overall performance and student engagement. Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family member had seen a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library. So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in. They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again by anyone. Also another reason is that If they were to be taken out, then another person might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there, hindering their research or personal interest. That is why I think those types of books should be in a special room instead of them being taken out completely. Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important for education and personal growth. That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book or magazine then they should just request the book or magazine that they want to read. By doing that then the books that aren't being used could actually be used by someone else that is interested in it, ensuring all materials have a potential audience. So if we keep all our books, then more students and people would go and read, fostering a more literate and informed community. In conclusion, people might say that taking out books is better than keeping them. Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better for the long term. It is better because someday those books can be useful no matter how old they are, either for historical context or for a reader with a unique interest. If they were inappropriate books like mentioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place where they are accessible to adults. If there aren't enough interesting ones then requesting one is another way to do it without resorting to removal. That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do whatever in order to not let books go to waste, preserving knowledge and choice for everyone.
1721	4698	2	3	There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another. Censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate. One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' What is inappropriate to one person could be deemed viewable to another. This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know what is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries are not a good thing.     John and Sarah walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that depicts a person standing over a two hundred pound, twenty four point, state record, whitetail deer with with a gun in their hand. John is a firm believer in providing for his family and the rights given to an individual in the second ammendment of the United States constitution. Even if that means killing an animal for its resources. For some there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat. John will see the magazine as an opportunity. He might learn tips from the magazine, or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful.      Sarah on the other hand is a conservative. She believes killing is wrong and inhumane. She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section. Sarah prefers not to know where her meat came from. She will view this magazine as inappropriate. Again, censorship is relative to the person looking over the material. Does that mean that just because Sarah thinks the magazine is inappropriate, it should be taken off of the shelf so that someone like John can not read it, appreciate it, and gain knowledge from it? That choice is up to Sarah not to read the magazine, not to the librarian. Sarah is responsible for her own views and choices. She is entitled to them. John is entitled as well. Leave the choice to the reader.     Over in the book section there are Alex and Michael. Alex is a fanatic for science and history. Michael has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion. At the end of the row, on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution. Alex belives this theory and sees the book as interesting. Michael looks at the book and thinks to himself, 'That stuff is not true. Why would anyone waste their time reading it.' Does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because Michael will not read it. Michael should just walk away from it. If he chooses not to, that is up to Michael. Leave that choice to Michael.     Up at the desk there are the librarians.They have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well. But the books, music, movies, and magazines that are displayed  for checking out should not be chosen because he or she likes them or opposes them, but because someone might be looking for the information in that material. If the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it.     Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries. It takes material away from people that can be useful. Censorship, along with many other things is relative. What one person may deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person. Based on moral values, character, and opinions developed with progression of life, people have made judgements on what is appropriate or unacceptable. That choice to look at that magazine, read that book, or listen to that song should be left up to them, not made for them.
1722	4699	2	3	Has it ever occured to you that some of the things we read about and take home from libraries are not for young children?   Certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people. Not all books, music, movies, and magazines offend people or condone in things but they also give children the right to learn about things or know things that are to rated and shouldnt be learned at a library. Most music in todays society is not appropiate because of the content that is used such as sex,drugs, and violence. Last fall when I visited my schools library I came across a movie that I thought was not school appropiate and should'nt be seen without a parents verification. Anything about sex and drugs give young teens and children the right away to do it even if they read it, heard it, or saw it in school.  When im walking through the town and I see teens doing things that should'nt be done the first thing the first thing he/or she says is 'I heard it on a movie'. Most public lbraries have movies, book, music, and etc on shelves that aren't appropiate but it should'nt be welcomed to young children. Most librians are busy and cant watch the entire library, but can make sure it is secured and put away from juveniles.   Most of the time a child will read what looks interesting and fun. Todays books that condone violence have guns drugs and sexual content on the front cover making it hard for a child not to want to read it. In a school library ninety percent of the time all books are age appropiate, but in a public library it's not because the public library is not just for children but for adults too. Some books shouldnt be of shelves but the rated things should be.  In conclusion libraries need to watch what's being checked out no matter who its from and I.d should be asked for to ensure that age-inappropriate materials do not fall into the hands of young children.
1723	4700	2	3	All things in the world are not strictly black and white. Every person is different, with varying ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of the speech, and the press.      Magazines, music, books and movies are mainly for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. Let's say there is a fourteen-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school. While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. Some parents may deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation.      It's human to mess up and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. To censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens. Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together.      The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment.      Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda. There's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how appauling someone may find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued.      Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere for something that better suits their personal tastes and values.
1724	4701	2	3	There are many prespectives on censorship in our country. Thats just how our country is we have different oppinions on everything we do. But we have to live with it, there are many different prespectives that come from old, young, parents, and children. In libraries there are some books,music, etc that may be offensive to people.     But we all have different oppinions therefore we can never listen to one pupil. Or it would start a fight between people that disagree with him/her. I think people that go into the library should be mature about what goes on in there otherwise they shouldn't be in there looking at whatever they are wanting to read about.          The library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us. But if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge. The books that they would get rid of would be because of the children. Because parents don't want children to look at material that is not appropriate for them so they try to keep it hidden.     I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it. And we should remind parents that some things in the library is not suitable for childrens eyes and let them be responsable for what thier children look at, rather than removing the materials entirely.
1725	4702	2	3	I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as National Geographic. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with adult magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you, as that infringes upon the rights of others.
1726	4703	2	3	When picking a book, music, movie, and magazines from the library it's always a hard decision because you might be like me and want to read more than one book at a time. Books that are found offensive are often more interesting than just plain boring books, as they challenge our thinking. So why would anybody take books off the shelf for being offensive? When children pick books from the library you want to make sure they are kids books and you might also want to check to see if they are educational. You definitely wouldn't want a little kid getting ahold of an adult book or a book that is found offensive in some way. So having an adult section and a kids section is a simple and effective solution. When we walk into a library full of books, there's a huge variety of any kind of books. We would lower the use of going to the library if books were taken off the shelves because there wouldn't be any use of going. If you are not going to find a book there, why go to the library anymore? The last reason to not take books off the shelves is people that can not afford to buy a book from anywhere obviously come to the library to borrow a book. So taking books away would just limit their learning and would not be very beneficial to them, restricting their access to knowledge. The only reason that I would find it okay to take offensive books and anything else off shelves is for childrens sake and safety. If the library's are thinking about taking offensive books off shelves, they should have a public vote to see what everyone else thinks about it. If they decide to take books off the shelves, why not just have an adult section in the library? Anybody that is eighteen years of age or older could be in there. So make finding a book easier and don't take our offensive books completely away from us, preserving choice for all readers.
1727	4704	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Katherine Paterson. Katherine Paterson is an author who, like the quote from her, believes that some books should never reach the hands of children. Does everyone believe the same way, no. I am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive. You are an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence. You, as this woman, pick up a book and read the first page, on this page you see cursing and decide to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library. The library soon becomes half empty because of one woman and her beliefs. Beliefs are a wonderful thing outside of reading and can make you who you want to be. Books do not, in my opinion, have beliefs. This is true for some books but a book where someone runs from danger or flies into the sky, those are not beliefs those are dreams and no one can crush dreams offensive or not. I compare books to dreams simply for the fact that they are dreams, the dreams of the authors who wrote them and wanted to share that dream with the world. Telling a person they can not publish their book simply because another person finds it offensive is telling the author your dream is offensive. If you do not want your child to share this book of dreams then do not let your child pick up the book. You are the parent of the child who picks up this book then you can protect it from the offensive danger it holds like you protect it from the dangers of strangers in the real world. Authors do not always write for the sake of everyone. Authors do not write for one woman, one man, one child, authors write for those who share a similar dream. If you do not share the same dream as the author that is fine, no one is forcing you to share in their sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams. Authors write because they wish to write, to express themselves in ways only words and stories can. Do not shun a book because one thing in it offends you, to ban a book is to ban someones dream. In short you would never crush your childs dreams. If your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they cant. Why would you do something to someone elses dream who you have never met. Be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dream through a story. No matter the level of offence you do not have to pick up the book and read it. the number one way to not be offended by a book that might offend you is to never read the book to start with.
1728	4705	2	3	Certain material that are made to offend people should be removed from shelves everywhere. I am against any material that are offensive to someone or something else. The three main reasons I am against this is because it is wrong to offend others, offending others can lead to personal issues, and offending others or something else will eventually tire out. To simply write a book or a magazine, or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong. People should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated, a principle often called the golden rule. For someone to make negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song. Maybe that person has personal issues. In order for that person to ignore their personal issues, they make fun of someone else. Offending other people can lead to personal problems. How? If someone steadily talks about you or, on a daily basis, offends you, people can get depressed. They can start believing that they are nothing. I remember a girl in the eighth grade told everyone that I was a 'garden tool' and that I would do anything for a piece of change. She also made a song, taunting me everyday about how I looked. She actually recorded it and passed it out at school. People heard it, and like followers, they started taunting me, too. I soon became depressed. I got so bad to the point that I was suicidal. I thought the world would be a better place without me. I had to go see a shrink to get over those thoughts. What other people do to you or say about you can have a bad effect on them. Last but not least, people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone. The victim will get tired of being teased or talked about. People would stop listening to that negative garbage. If people stop supporting that degrading stuff, then the author wouldn't have anything to write about. The singer wouldn't have anything to sing about. Their career will have gone down the drain because there is no future in offending others. There are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries, stores, and everywhere else. These negative comments will get nowhere in life. As I brought out in my body, it's simply wrong to offend others, it can lead to personal issues, and it will eventually tire out or get old. Nothing good comes from making people feel bad. So once again, these negative materials should be abolished everywhere.
1729	4706	2	3	In my personal opinion I think that those books that have things that you don't want to read or you think are offensive should stay. It's not like that person that is offended by it has to read it; they can simply choose another book. Say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you. You think to your self that book should be removed from the library just because you think it is offensive, but you have to think in other peoples shoes. Just because you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will think it is. That is why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so a kid who likes picture books will not get stuck with a book that has curse words or other things that are meant for adults. Same concept with movies, magazines, music, and etc. Take this for example. I was walking through the library when I saw a book called To Kill a Mockingbird, and I thought to myself that looks like a stupid book and I wouldn't want to read it. I think that they should throw this book away. Now lets think does that sound fair. Maybe that is some kids favorite book and when he comes in there the next day it is gone. What about this, lets say you go in to look for your favorite book and you find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did so they threw it away. Doesn't seem to fair does it. In conclusion that is what i think about removing books that are offensive or some people just don't like. I think they should leave it on there because we shouldn't remove it based on our personal opinion alone.
1730	4707	2	3	There's bad, and good books out there. Some people find different books offensive, to what they do. Other's like the books that other people dislike. In a way books are both bad and good. Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike to read. I think that when you go in a library there should be improper books for people to read. Children go in library's, what if they pick up a bad book and form horrible habits? Children, and adults have very different views on what to read. Kids want to read fairytale stories, etc. Adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder, and such. Yes, library's can let people check out any book they find interesting; But, what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around. It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kid's wouldn't form bad habits, or discover anything there not suppose to know. Kid's are noisy, and they will try to read your books, or see something bad on a magazine. In library's, there is the children's section, and the adult section. That helps in some way's, but your child can still find that bad book, etc at home. Parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's, or questions about that certain book, etc that they found. It's good to just put thing's away when your done, and keep every bad book, etc out of your childs reach. Books are bad, and good. You can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about, or see. Books have stuff that we sometime's need to know, and want to know more about. If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it, or look at it; and just hide it away from them. In the end, the problem will be solved through responsible parenting.
1731	4708	2	3	Censorship is a significant issue when you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, or magazine, and you often come across some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because of some content on one page? The person has that ability to read that book or not, making the choice for themselves. Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be old enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about, does this library have the book that I want. They should not have to think that way when going to a library. When you think of some of the worst books out there, who would want to read those anyway. Many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page. They do not think that they are banning a perfectly good book for others. A specific author's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' was a big uproar whether or not to put the book on the shelves. The book entailed the n-word, and some people were not pleased in this sequence. The book was very well written and just had a few bad words. Should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner? The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes. There are many ways to keep a certain age from getting a certain book. The library could put those certain books in their own part of the library. Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better suited way instead of banning the books altogether. The book still will be censored to be in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it. That book contained bad language, should the health and knowledge of the world go down because of some bad material in a book, that could help us in the near future. Authors have just the same right as we do. They should get a say in whether their own book is liable to be on the shelves. The government should not get all the say in this serious matter in hand. The community and the author that writes it should get more of the say than anyone else. When an author writes a novel they think of the great content they are putting into this great piece of art not thinking of, is this suitable for children to read. The author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about. There is this book we read this year called 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. This book had language that I do not think would be suitable for others in some content that was in the novel. Now do I think the novel should be banned from a library? No, because it used the words in a very nonviolent way. When reading it I felt that I was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates. Harper Lee was the author of this book and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. So the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing and the great stories you might miss.
1732	4709	2	3	In my opinion everyone should have a right to go to the library and get whatever book, magazine, movie, and music they want. People go to the library for a lot of reasons like using computers, finding books, etc. Also having a public library comes in handy for people that don't have a computer at home, providing essential access to information. It's a public library you should be able to go there and find about anything you need book or movie wise, as it serves the entire community. Everyone has different likes and interests about their books or movies, and I'm sure people go to the library and expect them to have what they are looking for. Some people do go to the library and not find what they're looking for, which is a disappointing experience. Then people get mad and upset cause they figured the library would have it and they don't, feeling let down by a public service. But yes I think that there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book at the library that you need. I mean it's a library they should have it all, representing a wide spectrum of ideas and stories. Also people have the right to go get whatever book, or movie they want. It's called freedom; everyone is different and everyone likes different things. There has been a few times I have went to our library to find books or movies and they didn't have them, which was frustrating. You would think that a library would have a book or movie over trying to potty train a toddler, but they didn't, showing gaps in their collection. I think that they should have any and every kind of book, magazine, and movie you want at the library. Yeah some people might take offense to it but who cares obviously they don't want it so leave it and go get what you want, promoting a live-and-let-live attitude. Just cause you don't like it don't mean other people don't, as tastes are subjective. So no I don't think just cause some people don't like them they should be removed from the shelves. So no I absolutely do not think that any books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves. You are who you are and you like what you like it shouldn't matter what other people think about it as long as it's what you like, embracing personal freedom. So in my opinion the library should be a good use to everyone, and leave the books, magazines, etc. on the shelves for the people who do like to read or watch them, ensuring access for all.
1733	4710	2	3	I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People enjoy books with offensive language or content; people love to feel the energy or tone of the writer, which can be powerful and authentic. I personally love offensive language; if everything was censored it would feel like everything is dull and fake, lacking the raw emotion of real life. Consider the phrase, 'You are cheating on me you jerk'; you feel the shock in your body. Now look if I censor it 'You are cheating on me you person' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different things you would have said differently and uncensored, showing how censorship drains genuine feeling. If you are a parent who doesn't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this, taking personal responsibility. Instead of removing why not just move them to an adult section of the library, which is a practical compromise. The adult section will warn kids and parents what they're getting into; if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality then that means they should not be in that area, allowing for choice. Libraries are usually divided into sections but if not, if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into sections of the libraries then they should tell you, providing clarity on their organization system. This approach maintains access while respecting different comfort levels, ensuring that valuable and challenging materials remain available for those who seek them out.
1734	4711	2	3	Censorship in the United States is a complex issue because what is offensive to some may not be to others. So how do we know when expressing ourselves in an artistic manner that we've gone too far? We don't and that's why censorship is such a controversial topic, with no easy answers. In the music industry recently there has been messages in songs and music videos that aren't the best suited for teenagers. Being a teenager is a time of constant turmoil in one's life, you are required to make decisions that will define you as a person. When songs out there are about drug use and other crimes teens see them as cool things and follow along cause they see them as everyday activities that can do no harm but little do they know that they are wrecking their life by doing this, so I somewhat agree with censorship in that kind of thing to protect the vulnerable. In literature and art things take a more serious tone than in music and other media. With literature it's about conveying one's thoughts and feelings about a story or other subject. In art you express yourself visually on a canvas or abstractly through other materials and forms, but in both ways you express your feelings and emotions. So censoring these would in turn censor one's voice and emotions, stifling creative expression. When you take away a man's voice and emotions you are left with an empty shell of a person who will never know life to the fullest, which is a profound loss. As time has changed I have found that people have also changed. When Mark Twain uses the 'n-word' in some of his literary works it didn't offend people at the time, but now times have changed, showing how societal norms evolve. Now it's not ok that Mark Twain used this word but on the other hand it's ok for rappers and others to say it every other word in their music, creating a double standard. So how do we know what's offensive and what's not? Well it's all from the reader, listener, or viewer's point of view, making it highly subjective. These days parents try to shield their children from the outside world and make it seem that it's all rainbows and butterflies by censoring things the children might be subject to read, hear, or see in their day to day lives. This does not solve the problems in the world; there will always be war, crime, and death no matter how hard we try to stop it as long as there's 'good' there will always be 'bad', and sheltering children does not prepare them for reality. All loyalties aside in my honest opinion I believe censorship in the United States is a bad idea and will never work to solve actual problems with the world. It will just cover them up just like the dialogue or image they so badly want to go away, ultimately failing to address the root causes of societal issues.
1735	4712	2	3	Although it is a new day and age where demand is high for electronic books, hard back and paper back books are not obsolete quite yet. Many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries, and starting the quest for the perfect book, enjoying the tactile experience. Also, with the economy at a downfall, it is the cheaper way to go, providing free access to knowledge and entertainment. But the big question is, can people find everything they desire at their local library? For some people that may not be the case because of library censoring, which limits available choices. Yes it is true that many libraries now censor many things that they would think would be inappropriate for children's eyes, aiming to create a safe space. I agree that some things should not be displayed on shelves at libraries, particularly in areas frequented by young patrons. Although some adults or teens desire more mature articles, these things should not be available for children to view, balancing different needs. One of the most loyal customers to the library are children and their parents, who rely on its services. Parents do not want their children to be exposed to explicit materials at that young of an age, wishing to preserve their innocence. Also if libraries lose young families as customers, that would be almost half their clientele gone down the drain, which would be detrimental to the library's survival. So next time when you want to borrow something that may be too mature for children, you might want to reconsider going to the library for that specific item. Instead go to a book store and buy whatever you need there, ensuring you get the material you want without impacting the library's family-friendly environment. Keep children in a safe, innocent environment while still allowing adults to access the materials they seek through alternative means.
1736	4713	2	3	Do I believe certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No, just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves. Sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people, from political views to social commentary. Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf. Its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books that are more to your liking. If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empty book stores and barren libraries. Because face it people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion or politics, is being made fun of in a book that they had read about. We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different to engage with. We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine; it is a matter of personal selection. We have a choice and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the lengthy and difficult process to get it removed and taken off the shelf. You never know someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was beneficial or relating to their own life experiences. So it should not be up to one person to decide for everyone, but if a whole community has a legitimate and widespread problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option worth discussing.
1737	4714	2	3	I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive. But some of those books have a meaning behind it, a deeper historical or literary value that should be considered. I think theres one book out there that a lot of people love to read, and that is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book uses the 'n-word' word a lot and many people take that offensive, but why is that the case? There was a big argument about a lot of book companies changing the word in the book to 'slave' or other less offensive terms. From my perspective I think it should stay the same as the author originally intended. Why change that now after all these years? Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named Huck saving Jim. Its not being used in a bad way at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days to provide an authentic context. The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life, like friendship and moral growth. Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word in modern conversation, but also not change it now, after its been out for a long time to the public and is considered a classic. The book would not bring the same meaning or historical impact as it would if it is being changed and sanitized for contemporary sensitivities.
1738	4715	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library. In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left for anyone to read or learn from. The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question among educators, parents, and librarians. There is a simple answer to this question. It should not be censored because censorship restricts access to ideas and information. Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background, such as their religious or cultural upbringing. As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The author made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize the logical conclusion of their own censorship demands. The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries to preserve a diverse collection. As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books, an empty repository of nothing. To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these more mature works. Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues arising from its presence. These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately by library staff. The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with, often evoking strong emotions. This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored and who gets to make that decision. The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line; it is often a matter of subjective interpretation. Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages, exploring the challenges she faces? In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got impregnated within a book makes it inappropriate for younger readers, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind to real-world issues. Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices about what they consume, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible in a diverse society. Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left for anyone. This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone and our access to knowledge is erased. As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist in some materials. It can only be learned that yes, these things do exist, but by using better judgement and personal responsibility the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad' from the shelves.
1739	4716	2	3	Do you agree with me that we should be allowed to read, listen to or view what we want? I think it is unfair that the schools have the right to tell us what we can look at; the right is ours this is america and we have the right to do what ever we want within reason. I think we should have the choice to read it and if it is offensive then dont read it becuase it might be offensive to you but not everyone thinks it is volgare or rude and obsene. What one person finds objectionable, another may find enlightening or entertaining. I am asking you the paper to stick up with me and fight the school and tell them what they should be allowed to read because it is not right to censor good material just because some nut job does not like it or finds it challenging. That is all i am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship, to defend our right to choose for ourselves what we read and view.
1740	4717	2	3	I think that no books should be taken away from public access. I think that if a adult or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to, provided it is within the legal boundaries. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they cant because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to make that choice for themselves. And if it bothers someone else nearby, the bothered person can leave the area or simply choose not to listen. If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inapropiate who cares as long as it is not being forced upon others. And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they cant because it's to violent so the library doesn't have it, that seems like a limitation on their choices. I think librarys should be able to have whatever inventory they want to serve their diverse community. And if it's to violent or if the music is to dirty just don't let children get a hold of it by placing it in a restricted section or requiring parental permission.
1741	4718	2	3	If I found a book that I thought was inappropriate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into it to see what she thinks about the book or books. If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove them without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove it, she could take a vote or tally on that specific book and then go from there to see if it did indeed need to be removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropriate for people to look at, and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism, which can be harmful to young readers. If I found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults or some teenagers should watch. My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and etc. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies and watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that were on the film. For example, if the movie or book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they saw it on tv. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these; I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen. Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. A few years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes in the lyrics. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it is their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release them so everyone can listen to it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time and collective effort from the community.
1742	4719	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone might learn from it. Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocery store, they should know that no matter how tempting it may be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. It doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do. Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated 'R' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated 'R' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a guardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensely because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' It's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determining whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provocative book. If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life would possibly become rather boring. Although, some people might find books and songs to be offensive, others might benefit from these materials. A child might pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a more advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opportunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkeys for some children. They might use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opportunity to discover. I once read that even English classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The Catcher in the Rye. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so it shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult might learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials. In conclusion, books, magazines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude it may be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, it's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from it. Do you really want our society to prohibit intellectual thinking just because they think certain material might be offensive? Think about it.
1743	4720	2	3	I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side of profanity is it gives books, music, and movies taste and texture; it shows how a person feels, and most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person's behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is a good and bad; I like it in music and movies but I hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person's age; for example, age three and thirteen, books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can. The reason why people should take it off the shelves is because kids should have a healthy and profanity free life. They should have a good development towards learning. Books and other entertainment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easily and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselves. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity, don't buy it. Also keep it out of kids reach. The main reason why people swear is because of movies and songs; it changes a person dramatically. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life by not having a good job, getting in jail, or raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes. In a movie, profanity is good for movies; it gives it action and drama. Profanity is words that are most times negative, expressing anger and rudeness. We have a society full of profanity; this is like a wide spread disease, passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have experienced this the hard way because I'm Chinese and I came to the United States back in 2005; I did not know any English. People would cuss at me all the time; this could all be avoided if we didn't have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned a lot about people by the way they talk, letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream; some people want it and others don't. People could make their choice of putting themselves in a profanity free life. People can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what I think is the right thing to do but not for adults. Due to profanity, people tend to put themselves in trouble. For example, some people in the U.S. get pulled over by an officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer, putting themselves in more trouble; this could all be avoided if he didn't have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech; I know this because I'm on the high school football team. Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end what I'm saying is profanity should stay but keep it out of reach of kids; for books, parents don't buy them if you don't want your kids to see them. For movies, read the label on the back of the case and see the age limit for profanity. Lock up the cable shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no access to them. If you don't want any part of profanity, you can make yourself stay away from it. We all know that there is nothing you can do about others using profanity; just don't use it yourself and stay clean; do what you think is right for your own family.
1744	4721	2	3	All materials in a library are for the public. This is why we have public libraries. Children are most likely with an adult when they go to a library and are normally looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. If a customer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive then it most likely was not an accident. Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive. Children are very curious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library. This is where an adult comes in and supervises the child. Some parents don't mind that children see these images or read inappropriate information, but on the other hand some parents do. If someone comes across information that would be offensive, they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is. Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. There is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store. It is the parent or guardian's decision to allow or not allow their child to visit the more inappropriate areas of the store. Everyone has different rules and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the libraries job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area. There is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there. For instance, more adult and inappropriate material is located in the back of the store. Adult matter is held back there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to be a little more private to people who are reading it. Childrens' books and movies are usually located in the front of the store so it draws their attention more. Children may never know what else is in the store if they don't go looking for it. Children should be accompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for inappropriate material. Other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. Also if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it. Everything is labeled in a library and something doesn't just pop up out of nowhere if you were not looking for it. Overall, material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store. Children should be watched if they are curious and wander in the library. If someone does not want to find this information or think it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area which it is located, allowing others to access what they need.
1745	4722	2	3	In our society, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, libraries and book stores should not remove things from their shelves because they could be offensive. People have the right
1746	4723	2	3	When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well, such as graphic violence or hate speech. In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong. Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to, as the content was far too mature. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear due to its explicit lyrics. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive, often depicting scenes that are not suitable for a general audience. I myself would think that teenagers above the age of sixteen would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of, such as disrespect or aggression. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with. After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction for protecting our community's values.
1747	4724	2	3	I belive that every one has thier right to thier own opinion. If a parrent does not think that thier kid should do some thing dont let them, it is ultimately their responsibility. It kind of reminds me of how people are aginst hunting if you dont like it dont do it, and let others make their own choices. If every one would express thier own opinion the world would be alot better place. If I dont like someone and I tell them i dont like them they knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more, avoiding future conflict. So in a bigger picture if one nation tells another that we dont like them they will not try to make friends with us any more, leading to clearer international relations. so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better and more straightforward. If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music, movie, or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad based on their family's values. My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right, demonstrating how perspectives differ. So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you and respect your guidance. As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them. I find one exception to this rule cyotes (we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest, threatening livestock). I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area and need to be controlled. So if you dont want your kids watching rated R movies then block them on tv, taking direct action in your own home. Its the same thing with the other things like the magazines, books and music, where parental oversight is the key rather than public censorship.
1748	4725	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With several religious and cultural factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture. Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes racist content, cultural beliefs, and religious beliefs. Racism was a big deal in the late sixties to early seventies. Thanks to legislative efforts, slavery became illegal in the United States. Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today. If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it will never stop. Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did, as it can be damaging to their self-esteem. Harsh put-downs and comments toward cultural beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library, perhaps with a content warning. As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country, but this should be done respectfully. There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s). I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like. However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions. This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about, which could lead to prejudice. Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not. It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the adult section to ensure maturity of the reader. For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting, free from these complex and potentially harmful topics. It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then a separate section for kids and/or adults with more mature themes. An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not, involving the community in these important decisions. That is for you to decide based on your own values and the needs of your community!
1749	4726	2	3	Every single person has there own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music or anything in life for that matter. What might be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion may not be bad in others opinionated views. Everyone will have there own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library, to create a neutral space. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to lisetn to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like librarys or say video stores your helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future, such as public outrage or child corruption. Then again censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time though we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like. By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then your giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that, which could lead to endless removals. It's not the librarys responsibility to watch over everyones child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to; that duty falls on the parents themselves. Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do, regardless of restrictions. By censoring and taking things off shelfs of librarys your not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about book they're not supposed to be reading; they can easily find it elsewhere. Censoring librarys is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learing vulgar language. Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television, from their own peers. What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not. Like i said, everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it. You can't remove everything off the shelfs because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to. We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to. By taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a free citizen. Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion to maintain a basic standard. Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way its written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one and infringing on creative expression. Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination and knowledge about the world. By taking books off shelfs i think you're hurting a childs ability to grow and understand complex realities. Censoring is a good and bad thing, a double-edged sword. It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow depending on how it is applied. Censoring some things are a good thing, but like i said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scences, as context is important. Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people put in books and movies to be fully prepared for life's challenges.
1750	4727	2	3	This is along the lines of personal thought. Some people can be happy with things ,while others disagree. Unless its racist or sexist no one has any right at all to say something can't belong in a public space. If someone doesn't like a book than walk away from it don't ponder at why its there, someone else might want it for their own purposes. So I dont like this topic personally but i am ok with writing about it. Its not a choice just like it really shouldn't even be a choice for people to say what belongs where, unless it is rightfully owned by the individual and not public property. I know there are many things I dont like but I dont try and get things moved and banned, as that is not fair to others. Its there people want to read it, and that is what matters. Plus the person who wrote or made the object would be shot down, feeling a deep sense of sadness or rejection from the community. Along the lines of insulting a race and/or being sexist, If that is being done in the book it should be stopped and disposed of to prevent harm. People have the right to say they are not happy with that but if they just dont like the topic but others do than they need to move on and not make a big deal out of it, practicing tolerance. Now if the title clearly says what the book is about than walk away don't pay attention to it; you have been warned. People might use it for research or something in the future, so it has value to someone. Now people can be self-centered and just want what they need so they cause a huge, argument or fight over stupid little things, which is counterproductive. Thats the people that always got things handed to them which I imagine is why this topic came up in the first place. So that is my thoughts and believes about the topic of Censorship. It doesn't matter where, in school or at a library it is there because someone is/was interested in the item, and that interest should be respected. I know this is my thoughts and believes, people may completely think what i wrote it stupid, some may think its smart, and that is their right. Its just the culture you grew up in and state of mind you are in that current time and place that shapes your view on such matters.
1751	4728	2	3	I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people may find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things, creating a different problem altogether. Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing and a vital form of artistic expression. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the CDs should not be sold in stores. The same principle could be said for these materials in the library. Some may find them offensive but others greatly appreciate it and have a right to access them.  Some people might be interested in these topics. Just like some people might be interested in fantasy or comedy, others have a genuine interest in materials that deal with challenging or mature subjects. It would not be fair for libraries to remove these materials from the library, and deny the people that do like them the right to rent these materials. A library's purpose is to serve a diverse community with varied tastes. Another factor is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading a book or viewing movies that might be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then there is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else might find those materials offensive is no reason to take them off the shelf.  I can see why some parents might be upset that their kids could see some of the things in the library that might not be appropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have had a special area for kids materials. If the parents were worried about their kids seeing some of the questionable materials they could simply bring the kid to that designated area. This is a practical solution that respects both parental concerns and the access rights of adult patrons. Ultimately, I dont think that these materials that might seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be offended by something and it is not fair to deprive others of those materials even if they are offensive to some, as this would lead to a diminished and homogenized collection for everyone.
1752	4729	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportunities and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two people are the same, and a library must reflect this diversity. First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner or the governing body of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is meant by this statement is that there are so many different types of writing that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library to cater to a wide audience.  If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is property of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner, let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it through the proper channels. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that opinion. It takes one person to make the difference and start a conversation.  Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their opinions and will stick by them. That's expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse opinions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressing them either, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and either agree with that opinion or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like and forming their own judgments.  Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their opinion. To spread an opinion is to let the world know where someone stands on a specific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinion. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one, as it fundamentally undermines the free exchange of ideas and the educational mission of these vital public institutions.
1753	4730	2	3	Need help with Censorship in my local library. (I changed the name of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the library I think, but it illustrates a common issue.) To the people at the newspaper I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the library. Nothing really all to serious I guess. It seems the librarians there are censoring tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie Psycho.  They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is too bloody and scary for some of the other readers. There have also been some complaints from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie. To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have already blocked all the inappropriate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go for my schoolwork. So then I tried to get the library board to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the weird adult rated things at the library. That way no kid will have nightmares any more. I also threw in the idea of separating all the books and movies by age group like child, teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic movies and books accessible.  The board said they would try my idea and see if it works but I would have to volunteer at the library and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw how big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundred pages of books at least. I was too scared to see how long the other lists for movies and magazines were. So seeing that it was too big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then I put up posters at the school I go to, to see if anyone else would be willing to help me with this enormous task.  So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article, I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I thank you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing too, thank you. Together we can work towards a solution that allows for both responsible access and the availability of important materials.
1754	4731	2	3	I think that if there are offensive books, music, magazines, etc then they should be put in a section of their own, or the librarians should have them kept up and if someone needs or wants them then they would have to go to the front desk in order to get them. This approach allows for access while providing a basic level of screening. I think also, if a young child or teenager cant see, read or hear those types of things than they should not be in there period, meaning they should not be in the general, freely accessible areas. This is a matter of common sense and responsible stewardship. Such a system balances the need for availability of diverse materials with the legitimate concerns of parents and the community regarding age-appropriate content, ensuring the library remains a resource for all without imposing outright bans.
1755	4732	2	3	Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more censorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You might never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just censor them in a reasonable way.  Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them by making them less accessible to young children. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book before they check it out, allowing for informed choices.  People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech and access to ideas. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are for everyone, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves entirely.  Instead of banning the books or complaining about them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books regarding content and suitability. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it in a constructive manner.  You may not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more thoughtfully organized than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure and learning for every age and interest, which is the ultimate goal of any library system.
1756	4733	2	3	Offensive materials can be anything, but I'm talking about libraries and what's inside. Books, music, movies, and magazines can be offensive to someone but not everyone. Removing these materials from library shelves because a few people view them as offensive material is not a good idea because if they find it offensive then somewhere someone is enjoying it. Not everyone will find a book, song, movie, or a magazine to be offensive and for that reason no books, cds, movies, or magazines should be withheld from the public in any library. My friends liked reading a certain author's books but I did not like them, but I did not make them stop reading because of it, just like a classic novel can be offensive but if you find it offensive don't read it, plain and simple. There will always be one person who doesn't want their kid to watch a certain movie, or read that author's book, but that is not a good reason to remove any materials from the library shelves, let people read what they want to read, watch what they want, and listen to what they want, there is no good reason to remove a book from the library shelves. We all have a right to read, watch, and listen to anything we please. Having somebody you have never seen get a book, movie, or a magazine removed from the library because they find it a little offensive, is like having someone kick you because you don't have a lot of money. Many books from all over the world can be considered offensive to at least one person and that one maybe two people do not have any right to tell anyone what they can not read. Censorship in libraries is a horrible idea because not everyone will read that book or listen to that cd. Having a chance is all we need to read a book or listen to a song that might change our lives, for better or worse it should be our choice to read what we want. Any material can be considered 'offensive' but most of it is not offensive just what people don't want their kids to read. Offensive or non-offensive materials can not be declared by a few people but by an entire country. What one man considers offensive another man considers to be life changing. Anything can make someone change and in order to have that chance we should have the freedom to read whatever we would like. If you find a book offensive remember this you had a chance to read it, now give that chance to someone else, and let them decide for themselves.
1757	4734	2	3	Today's world is filled with racism and criticism. Anything we do is either right or wrong, no in-between. Whenever you're out to eat, or shopping you can hear offensive comments or see images all around you. The newspaper, news, and internet make events appear worse than what they are, if it refers to certain people they take it offensively. If you go out looking for a good book to read, or a movie to watch, or music to listen to laying in bed, you pick what interests you. When you're looking through the selection you're going to see and recognize titles, or pictures that offend you. I know when I do I pick the object up and look and see what it says on the back, and then I make my own informed choice. In some way, someone, is going to find a movie, music, books, or magazine offensive. Say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people. What would be on the shelves? Nothing, authors have the right to write about anything they want, singers have the right to sing about what they want. In this country every single person has the freedom of speech. So libraries can't take something off the shelves just because someone finds it offensive. That's the point of the different genres of music and reading, so you can read and listen to what you want. Every individual has the choice of what they pick up and listen to or read. If someone finds something offensive, then they shouldn't pick the object up. Then, when that person complains about it, the bottom line is that it's their fault for reading it. There's going to be offensive things said about race, culture, looks, and weight. That's just a part of life and how people act anymore. There's just a point when you have to be the bigger person and ignore it and move on. So, no I do not believe that offensive books, music, or magazines should be removed from libraries or stores. We have the choice to pick what we read and listen to, and that personal responsibility is the foundation of a free society.
1758	4735	2	3	I think that if the books, music, magazines, or movies you have in a library are not offensive, then they have the right to put them on the shelves. There's nothing wrong with having music and magazines at a library because what if someone doesn't like to read but loves listening to music or doesn't like to read books but likes to read magazines. I think it's all right to have movies too. They could have a lot of educational movies or just some plain regular movies of all kinds. Now if a book or movie or magazine or music was found and it was genuinely offensive then they should be taken off the shelf, but this should be a rare and carefully considered action. If the books, music, movies, or magazines are not offensive in any way, they have the right to be on those shelves so everyone can use them and benefit from the diverse range of materials available for learning and enjoyment.
1759	4736	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or heard. They should stay only because these so called 'offensive' objects that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teaches us about our history or another country's history. It is true there are some things in a library that children shouldn't see yet but what's to stop them from taking a look anyway? There are people who crave this offensive knowledge but are told time and time again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the truth that holds violence than it being hidden from them. Without these things children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangerous and without the correct knowledge on how to handle it or where to go. That is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library, serving as vital tools for education and preparedness for the realities of life.
1760	4737	2	3	I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor certain works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imagine how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was destroyed. Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being destroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horrible just thinking about it so I believe that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the decision if their work should be saved or destroyed. With these reasons that I have shared with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a child's dreams think about how they would feel if anything of theirs was destroyed, and respect the creator's ultimate authority over their own creation.
1761	4738	2	3	Dear reader,  Do you believe that certain books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive? A lot of people in the world today are having this same question. Some parents think they should be removed, but others argue they should stay. I'm going to tell you what I think.  As a citizen, I know some parents are arguing that certain magazines and books should be removed from the library if they are found offensive. Well, if they do that then there wouldn't be anything on the shelves and the library would be shut down. I mean, I see where some of the parents are coming from; some of these things are offensive and not appropriate for children, but if you don't want your children to see them then keep them away from that section of the library or don't bring them; you go get the book or magazine they want and then bring it back home for them.  In the world today, everything is offensive to someone. I mean, everyone has their own thoughts on what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive. So eventually, if you were to take everything offensive out of the library, it would be emptied out. I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author is saying: 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor- then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (@PERSON1). I don't know about you, but this really sums it all up for me.  The truth is you can't always do what you want; you just have to live with the way it is and try to make it better for yourself and your family. If you read this article and really listen and take into consideration what I'm saying, I think you'll find that it would be a lot easier for you to just act like the offensive books and magazines aren't there, because if you try to get them taken out you won't even be able to go to the library anymore.  Sincerely the one and only, @PERSON2.
1762	4739	2	3	I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing, but it can go too far. Removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing. If those are removed, I do not think that people would care that much. Removing those small things, however, could grow into a bigger problem. It has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves.  It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental. A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they do not believe it is appropriate, so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf. Then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf. Pretty soon everyone is coming in with minor complaints about many different things, and almost everything has someone who wants it banned.  Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned, people would still complain until what they want happens. If the government has all these complaints, they might just shut down the libraries to avoid looking over every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork. The original purpose, being to block out offensive material, ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody. Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some.  In the end, a library should not be given the right to censor anything. The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk. Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others. Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired. The library should not have the right to take that inspiration away from the reader's hand.
1763	4740	2	3	What @CAPS1 You Do?  A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive material to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive material should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' material to be on the shelves of the libraries across the @ORGANIZATION1.  What is considered offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive material from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 on the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a different view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.  There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the library's own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not approve of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.  In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the library's own responsibility to be a mother to all of its customers. Let the libraries be!
1764	4741	2	3	I believe that offensive books should be taken off the shelf. Some books are offensive and some are inappropriate. The librarian could get rid of the books, so the little kids can'@CAPS2 get the inappropriate book. Movies that are rated '@CAPS1' and above should be removed. Anything that has an 'A' rating should be removed; the libraries are a public place to rent and return, buy or sell, or to trade movies, books, and etc. Keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health.  Anything inappropriate could be censored by a black marker. The old library I used to go to had all the slang, cus-words, and etc, all marked out with a black sharpie. Some of the movies were thrown out from the rating '@CAPS2' to all the above; the magazines had marks on the pages also, censored the slang in the magazine. The music at the library was blocked; some music was not blocked, and the rest were the censored part of the songs. The libraries should do the same like the old one did to maintain a proper environment.
1765	4742	2	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1  @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1 and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries quite often, and things that I see in there I feel shouldn't be in there. Like the movies. They're okay, but they're all sitting together. So that means me being a young lady, I see things that I know my mother wouldn't approve of me even looking at. They have censored movies just sitting there.  I even go through the shelves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldn't even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like it's a book about @CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they don't see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I don't think or feel that it should be censored books in the library and children are able to look at them. That's not right at all.  Far as the music, I agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different type of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldn't know how to respond to a song that's talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what their parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I don't feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.  I don't believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library. There are many of them books also. They shouldn't be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents. They don't need to grow up fast; they need to enjoy their life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things, that's not helping at all.  In conclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries. What I'm just asking you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there. They can even make their own side of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only. I know that this is the right thing and I know many people agree with me. People only want the best for their children and a library with a lot of censored things in there doesn't sound like the best. That just means they are starting off wrong.  Sincerely: A student who believes in changes.
1766	4743	2	3	Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies, or music. Different types of these works are significant to each person for various reasons. If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then ultimately no works would remain on the shelves. Therefore, I firmly believe that no materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necessities, and personal preferences that deserve to be accommodated. A few years ago, I had a classmate who held different ideas from a myriad of people on the topic of religious persecution. He disliked the idea of mixing people of different religions into one community and wrote a detailed paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was widely considered offensive. Even though I personally disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected outright. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been genuinely interested to read them. There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various complex problems. I believe it is fundamentally unfair that his paper was rejected and thus made inaccessible. People have different necessities based on what they have to accomplish in their work or studies. For example, I was reading a book last winter about a girl who was doing a school project on racism. She went to the local library to search for a book about apartheid in South Africa but couldn't find anything relevant. She asked a librarian if there were any available, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl might not have had anywhere else to go to get the crucial information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing her assignment. Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences and tastes. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others, and literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and personal convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would hope to find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that same right of access. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them personally, then soon nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire and require. In this world, diversity exists everywhere among people and ideas. People have and always will want, need, and desire different things for themselves. Works of literature are just one category of these things. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's individual frustration or displeasures, then indeed no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places, as these things are necessities to the world and its diverse population.
1767	4744	2	3	I think that if a book is found offensive then you shouldn't read it yourself. Cause what if someone else likes the book, they have the right to read that book and should be allowed to do so. Maybe it's an inspiration to them, maybe it will drive them to accomplish something they want in their life or provide them with great comfort. When someone walks into a library no one can tell them what to get; they make that decision themselves based on their own interests. So when a book offends you, maybe you should write to the author and talk to him or her directly about their book and your concerns. Things you could accomplish by writing the author is a letter in the mail stating that he or she is sorry for hurting you with their book, another is maybe a visit from the author in person to tell you that he or she is sorry for the pain that his or her book brought you. That's what I think is a more constructive approach. Also no, I don't think that the book or books should be taken off the shelves cause maybe, just maybe, it will motivate someone else instead of putting them down or causing them harm. It could be a source of strength for another reader, which is why such materials deserve their place in public collections.
1768	4745	2	3	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' I believe these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive. First off, they should be removed because some people might be offended by their content. Some materials might talk about race, religion, or gender in a critical way. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such a publication. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people talking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people could be offended, and I'm sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that kind of nonsense. So take them off the radio and out of libraries. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such, that item can have a bad affect in the later future on their development. They could start criticizing people for being different from them. Some books talk about religion in a negative light; some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take those critical books off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her for her preferences. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended by the portrayal. So take them off the shelves to prevent such hurt. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some readers might take offense to that unrealistic portrayal. So just take pictures of celebrities and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves entirely. In conclusion, based on some of my observations and reading, some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive to protect people from unnecessary harm.
1769	4746	2	3	Do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive? In my opinion I do not agree and I think they should not be able to take them off the shelves. Many people have different thoughts and opinions and I am going to state mine in the next few paragraphs. To begin with, not everybody likes to read or watch the same types of books or movies; tastes vary widely. Some like romantic stories, some like scary ones, others prefer mysterious plots and there are many more selections available for everyone. For instance if one person reads something that they do not agree with, that does not mean the next person to read it is not going to like it either. Sometimes I enjoy reading books where people get hurt and sometimes killed but if someone else reads it, they might think that it is horrible and very offensive, yet that doesn't mean it should be banned. Another reason is, when I go to the library I expect to get the book that I want to read, not what others prefer or approve of. One time I went to the library and I was looking for a specific romantic book to read and I could not find it on the shelf. So I went up and asked the lady at the counter and she said they do not have it anymore, and I asked why and she told me a lady found it wrong for children to be reading such material. In my opinion, maybe that lady did not even like romantic books herself. They should not make decisions just based on what one person believes is appropriate. The next reason is, the library put the movie or book on the shelf in the first place because they thought people would enjoy it and find it valuable. The writer or producer would not be very happy if he found out that his or her movie or book got taken out of the library because one person found it offensive. Just give the book a chance and see how everybody likes it over time. I understand if everybody thought it was really offensive then to consider taking it off, but not just based on one person's complaint. To end with, my belief is that if they had the book in their library at one time it should just stay in there till it gets old and falls apart from use. The library is open to any and every type of books, not just the boring or universally approved ones. So I believe the books should not get taken off the shelves; they should just stay right where they're supposed to be for all to choose. If they do not like the book or movie then suggest to other peoples family not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction firsthand before making a decision for everyone.
1770	4747	2	3	When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore to be hidden from view. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document. I am a musician by trade and passion. Music is my deepest passion and my creative gears are forever turning, seeking new inspiration. Often I look to other artists' works for this inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the public library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed from the collection for being too explicit or controversial. It was not the lyrics or any foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies contained therein! It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong, valuable feelings it has to convey to a willing audience. We might be tempted to discard the world's greatest novel because of perceived racial discrepancies or themes of wizardry. We might carelessly throw away a moving song because of its provocative lyrics. We might even trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance to be understood. How fair is this practice? Even now there might be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor. That is no fair crop in my right mind and sets a dangerous precedent. I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts, to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind. All things have a story to tell, even those we find challenging. A friend of mine once said to me that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable. We can reject them outright, we can ignore them, or we can absorb and interpret them for ourselves. To reject leaves you no smarter than you were before. To ignore leaves you in fear of the unknown. However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or a new type of person. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt and considered critically. Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is considered so, for it is these very things that help define us and our values. If you do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical for society? We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge, which is essential in our modern world.
1771	4748	2	3	No, materials should not be removed from the libraries. First, most books, movies, and music are the best way to support different ideas and perspectives. They all have their own unique way of convincing you and presenting a viewpoint. There are many different ways to understand the world, but these mediums are certainly among the most effective. Like a movie, for instance, some people need to see things visually to understand them fully. Because it takes time for some people to process information by seeing it unfold, rather than just reading or listening. It allows people to just sit and watch, which is a great way to absorb a narrative. Of course, some people might interpret a movie in a wrong way and get the wrong type of thought about something, which can make it feel offensive to them personally.  Like music, it is a great way to understand what an artist is trying to say or get across to the listener. You have to take time out to really listen and hear what they are talking about in the lyrics. If you hear a song only once and you just take it the wrong way, you never let your mind fully process what was said. Some people let one word or two make them think differently about the entire song, which is why it is important not to judge hastily. So before you judge, you should listen to the whole song and consider its complete message.  A book is one of the world's best ways to understand where someone is coming from, offering a deep dive into another person's life or experiences. A book is like living a short, alternative life. If you judge a book by its first couple of paragraphs, you would never get the true meaning out of it. With a book, you have to give it a chance to seep into your mind so that you can gain a real understanding. A book can tell you a lot of things, and sometimes, the themes can be challenging, which is why some people might take it as offensive. These types of materials should never be removed from libraries. These things are great ways to understand complex issues and diverse viewpoints. So if you find one thing offensive, try another medium; perhaps it offers a better way for you to understand the subject. Without these materials available to us, we would never understand or discover anything new in our world, and our growth would be limited.
1772	4749	2	3	When you think of a book, do you think of happy kids' books, or mysterious dark books? What if I was to say offensive books? Most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you might initially think. When I think of a movie I want to watch, I think of something that I am going to enjoy; not something I am going to shut off in the middle of it. What if you pick a movie that looks good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds promising, but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother, its content is the exact opposite of what you expected? Do you turn it in to some authority? Do you turn it off and waste your money without doing anything about the disappointment you feel?  Offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store shelves. If you are not going to finish it because it upsets you, then why should it be there taking up space? I am not going to watch or read a book if it is not going to make me feel good as a person or improve my state of mind. If people can sit there and write such material, act it out, or play it, then we should be able to speak our opinion on it and declare whether it is good or not for public consumption. People have feelings, and if they are going to be hurt by something we are supposed to enjoy, then those items should be taken off the shelves. We should do something about it to protect ourselves and others from unnecessary distress. We all should have the satisfaction of success for doing something for other people, and if not for them, then at least for our own peace of mind and comfort.
1773	4750	2	3	There should not be censorship on the books in the library. Just think of how many great pieces of literature are out there that no one would be able to get their hands on simply because they did not reach your personal standards or were deemed inappropriate by some. People would not be able to read some of their favorite books, the very stories that have shaped their thoughts and provided them with joy and knowledge. Would you really want to take that opportunity away from the people, to deny them access to these important works? Literature offers a window into diverse experiences and ideas, and removing books limits that vital exploration. If my argument has not changed your mind on the importance of free access, you could at least consider a compromise, such as putting the censored books behind the counter where they can still be requested by those who seek them, rather than banning them entirely from the library's collection.
1774	4751	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be exposed to unique perspectives, and no matter how inappropriate a subject might seem, it is often still factual and helpful in the process of learning and understanding the world. If anything, they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says something along the lines of 'adult content' to warn readers. History repeats itself, and this quote reminds me of periods in history where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the Holocaust, and the Jim Crow segregation laws in the deep south.  What about the Holocaust, when six million Jewish people were killed because they were Jewish. Some individuals might find books on this topic offensive, but that does not mean the Holocaust never happened. There are many offensive and controversial pictures and stories about events that happened during that dark time. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our youth to learn about what happened to ensure it is never repeated. And other difficult categories need to be read because it can help young people to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in their own futures.  The Jim Crow era started from the 1870s all the way until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Jim Crow laws took a toll on everyone in the American South, but some people, particularly African Americans, couldn't handle the oppression as well as others. In the south, most white people treated black people as inferior. They did not let them into their schools, their clubs, or their churches; they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of laws called the 'Jim Crow laws,' which pretty much was a list of rules designed to treat African Americans as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, then throughout their whole life growing up, they would realize that what was done to African Americans was deeply unethical.  Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we cannot shelter our youth their whole lives from the harsh realities of the world. Parents need to sit down with their children when they have questions and discuss the truth with them openly and honestly. What are parents going to do when their children go to school and hear other kids talk about subjects such as sex? Children could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained it to them. I am not saying to go let your young child look at explicit material by any means, but when children get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.  It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their children, or hovering over their shoulders like helicopters, controlling every piece of information they encounter. If children do not learn the truth about the real world and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in society, when they go to college they will not be able to stand up for themselves. If young people do not learn about history and what has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books the same way the Jewish people and the African Americans were treated. Just because these books are different or challenging, we will just get rid of them, just like how there were attempts to kill off all the Jewish people and African Americans because they were deemed different. And that kind of censorship is wrong and inhuman, going against the very principles of learning and freedom.
1775	4752	2	3	Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is deemed inappropriate. I believe that libraries should not have censorship as a standard practice. I personally think that it should be up to the individual library system if they could have that power, but it is generally unnecessary. If it is a library where there are always smaller children present, then I could understand if they might want to have a form of censorship for a dedicated children's section. In such a case, however, I believe it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropriate for their son or daughter, as they know their child best.  Now, say if it was just a normal public library with a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship policy. First and foremost, because it is your personal choice of the item; if you think a particular book or movie is offensive, then simply do not read it, watch it, or listen to it. The power of selection lies with the patron. Second of all, it would not be fair to the other people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer access that item just because one person thought it was offensive and complained. Also, people might start saying they thought an item was not suited for the library just because they did not like its viewpoint, which is not a valid reason for removal.  Last of all, if censorship were implemented, members of the library would likely demand the same right as the librarians to challenge materials. So many of all the members have such different feelings and opinions on various items, that so many different books and movies would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be very few materials left for anyone to enjoy. This would defeat the purpose of a library as a repository of knowledge and diverse thought. In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough to check their child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict over what items were taken off the shelf and how many items were removed. Therefore, I believe censorship is not needed in libraries, as it restricts access and creates more problems than it solves.
1776	4753	2	3	I know that some people find some books offensive, mean, cruel, or racist, but most of the time people write these books because its what they feel or what people want to read. Books are a privilege and we should be able to use that privilege. People need to learn that its ok that books are sometimes a little harsh. The world is not the most friendly place ever and books can help convey that with less hurt then experiencing it first hand. I know that all books should be left on the shelves because just because its offensive to someone doesnt mean that you should take it off. For every book, someone will find it offensive because of something. If the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone. If someone took the time to go out and write a book and make sure that everything about it is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read it. They have a right to write it and we have a right to read it and no one should take that right away. If someone wrote a book on the holocaust, people are very offended by that but they dont try to get rid of it. So why should any book be different because its not a big event like World War II or the Civil Rights Movement. It just seems so absurd that people go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by it. I think they just need to suck it up and move on. If they dont like it then dont read it. Someone who wants to can, so do not take that away from the people that want to read it. I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in our library and they said, 'oh you cant read that because it was found to be offensive.' It made me uphold that they would decide how someone else feels about a book. It makes me so angry that they get to decide how someone else feels about a book. They must be magic because I did not know that they know how someone else feels about a book or anything for that matter. We do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk. And im ok with that because at least they have it for people to read if they really wanted to. This is what i think should happen if they have books that they think is too offensive to people. At least try to give an effort to preserve our right as citizens of this country. Lets throw another aspect here about money. The book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely paid by you, the tax payer. So you and a lot of others paid for this book and now you want to waste that money. That is just insane that you would want to waste that money after it being paid for. This just makes me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book. Does it make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone. Well good for you mission accomplished. All you did was get worked up and you wasted money. People just need to realize the bigger picture not just themselves but others. In them taking down a book because you were offended, offends me. This offends me a large amount because now you ruined something that was not necessary to be taken down. This is how I feel about this subject. I am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library. If you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel. I know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work. People need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter. Stand back and think for a second and say, 'will this really effect me if i get this book taken off the shelf.' It also makes me mad that the library bought the book and now its gone so did the money just go to waste because the book is just gone. This is how I feel on the matter of getting rid of books.
1777	4754	2	3	Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer. Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own. In today's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what may be unacceptable for children to view may be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that God created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch a horror movie, they would rather their children not see a horror movie disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against a certain political ideology, it is unfair to others if all related content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who may wish to educate themselves on the said matters. Writing is a form of self-expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an American citizen: freedom of speech. By living in the United States, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it. Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the Civil War era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open-mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library. In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unacceptable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
1778	4755	2	3	Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive? If they are inappropriate, why do we keep putting those books, magazines, movies, and the big one, music out there in the world? Let me tell you why, because people in America unfortunately, have grown out of Saturday morning duty time, Mr. Rogers, Sesame Street, and many other nonoffensive shows. But with the shows, books, and movies played today are very inappropriate to the younger viewers. The old cartoons are over, at least the good cartoons like Looney Tunes and Scooby-Doo, The Smurfs, He-Man, etc, these cartoons, that I used to watch, that taught me how to be kind, honest, and brave have faded away. With the cartoons out now that are supposed to be good for children, all show the same thing and that is violence, greed, lust, and all the other seven deadly sins. They show these without explaining anything that can help the child in life, and that is wrong. We cannot take books off the shelves, make directors quit directing, rappers quit rapping, or make the pornography stop but we can restrict it to a point. It will always be out there whether it is by the blackmarket or the adult stores. Thankfully there are ways around letting your children watch these shows. Restrictions on the television, make the offensive books, magazines in a library to a restricted area to where no one can enter without being eighteen years old. There is a lot to say about the music out there. It can be and is very offensive. I was born and raised on the old fashioned country music and unfortunately country music has gone to the dogs. Sorry to say but the change in music started at the beginning of the 1960s, with the hippies. While they where all hopped up on drugs, music, and rebellion, they brought to life the new rock and roll. So it has been here over fifty years it is not going away. All we can do is hope our children does not turn on the radio that is tuned into that crap and say 'that sound like good music.' With the pornographic magazines, they have been around since Marilyn Monroe was in her prime. It is not going to stop whatever we do. All we can do is block it out of our lives. We can try and keep it out of our childrens eyes but it will not help they will always be known to this world. I think we should move these things to another part of the library, that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library. Then we will move onto the music, and then the shows. Remember it will always be out there, all we can do as parents is try to keep it out of reach of our children. We can't stop it but we can try and keep it out of there eyes. With the will power of parents it CAN be done. Failure is not an option.
1779	4756	2	3	Libraries, a sanctuary or a battleground? This world is like no other world but to have some of our ideas blocked because there too offensive thats absurd. There is a lot of things that are offensive in a library such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc... But if they are so offensive to some people then why keep complaining do something about tell it someone. Now librarys are a place where people can relax and grab a good book to read it. When they stumble upon this book that is highly offensive why put it back. Say something and tell the manager this book is too offensive to be in a library. There are kids in the library maybe looking for something to read they might stumble upon a movie that is very inappropriate. Things like that should not be in a public library. As a U.S. citizen I believe that things like that should be removed for the shelves. Why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to. Some of these books now and days need to be censored. Because of all the foul words in there kids might pick up all that foul language. How about some of this music don't you think some of the lyrics maybe be offensive to some people. When rock stars, rappers, etc... write there lyrics they don't think of what other people think of them. They just might put the most baddest language in there songs they don't care they just want the money. Thats why you should put you're foot down and say this is going a little to far why not censor some of your lyrics? Why not write a letter stating your concerns. Things in the librarys like books, movies, magazines, etc.. all should be checked and blacked out. Some of this shouldn't even be displayed in the librarys. There are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library. Lets take a magazine for example, a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex, drugs, and other things related to that. Some people might like it but for a twelve year old boy to pick up something like that and start reading it. To me thats wrong I dont know about anyone else but that shouldn't be displayed in a library. Now I've been to a library before they have some inappropriate things in there. But I really didn't think anything of it but when I seen a eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence that's something he might pick up on. He is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book. Now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible. This is all where censorship comes into play by editing a lot of the things in the library. People now and days dont care but they should start caring more. Thats just my opinion why I think its wrong to put all this offensive stuff in a public library. I think this is something kids don't need to see what do you think.
1780	4757	2	3	I believe that if that book, music, or magazines that is offensive and people don't like it then maybe they should remove themself from the library. There are a lot of things out there that people like to read and listen too. Maybe for those people who do not like it they can go to an other library. There are a lot of them around us. If a person did not like what they seen at that library then why go back? It could be offensive to some people but not all. So if people try to fight about removing them then the people that like them are going to be mad because they
1781	4758	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't think so, these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want. If you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent. For those under eighteen when they get a library membership they should have to verify thier date of birth, and what thier parent srequest their child to be able to read, play, or watch. Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less parents of anger for thier children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games. Now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed. It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor. From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For instance these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. In result of this I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should. He also misbehaves in school constantly. That is just one example of the many I know of. Even if the parent gives permission for thier child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age. Some parents make poor decisions on thier parenting, and it will reflect them later in life. So my overall opinion would be no. Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children in the future will not have as many crimes all together. There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse. Keep this all in mind. The American Library Association.
1782	4759	2	3	Today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive. Movies, books, songs and magizines are a few examples of where someone might find something offensive. I believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose. If someone thinks that something is offensive I think that they should just take what they find offensive away from themselves and not take it away from everyone else also. When a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs. Sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience, to express a personal truth or to reflect a social reality. When someone finds a movie offensive there is a reason for why it is the way it is; it's to get a point across. If people find the movie offensive they just simply shouldn't subject themselves to it. If they don't watch the movie they won't have anything to be offended about. Certain books in libraries are found offensive to some people just because they don't agree with what is in them. If there is something in a book that you don't agree with you don't just take the book off the shelf and throw it away. Other people might injoy reading that book. If the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away. I do not believe that media that is found offensive to some of the public shouyld be removed. Not everyone finds certain things offinsive in the media. Again, everything that is put onto the market and into the media has a purpose; it's purpose is to get a point across to others and to foster a diverse marketplace of ideas.
1783	4760	2	3	Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics. Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing. Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', 'Parental control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems. Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve. These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring parental control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances and help maintain a respectful environment for all patrons.
1784	4761	2	3	Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on. Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the United States or the governor of your state. If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything. What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with. So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with. Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president. Barack Obama was being question about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in Hawaii. I personally think he was in fact born in the U.S. But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton. It was uncalled for to begin with. I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president. Ultimately, the decision to remove content is complex and should not be taken lightly.
1785	4762	2	3	What if some one found your favorite book offensive? Inapporate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children.On the other hand, you can not sheild people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but an another person may see no problem with it. Children need to be protected from materials that may hurt them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and cop harmful things they read . Bad influences can be even magazines with famous celeberties being caught breaking the  law or doing bad things and young minds see that as 'cool' and may try to follow tha example. Children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, television and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protect but, you can't baby proof life. They willl be introduced to plenty of bad influnces in there life time but, it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. Kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home. Libraries are places for use public and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people and someone will always find something bothersome with somting or another. People have different views, believes and religions, and, books on these might be offensive to some but, the life style of another. Like The  quote by Katherine Paterson, said if we take off the shelves every book or material that somone finds offensive there will be no books in the libraries at all. Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people but, they should have a right to be read if their is someone who wants to read them. It is not the librarys job to be prejudice against certain books for because someone does't agree with it. Books should be a wide varitey like the people who are reading them. Also children are protect from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices and distinguish right from wrong.
1786	4763	2	3	I believe that any book or movie that is in the library is there for a good reason. The world is full with things that will hurt and make a person feel bad about themselves, and there are things in the world that will make you feel like you are on top of the world. Yes, there are things that children can see and what they are not supposed to see, and those things are mostly likely not exposed to the student until they are at a mature and a responsible age. Life is full of things and as children grow up they are going to be taught, shown things that parents think are uncomfortable. Such as: Books that show people with disorders, books about romance, movies with cussing and sex scenes in them, violence, some parents don't even want their children to see a simple kiss on the cheek. Which I find really weird because things like that are going to happen in life. On the other hand, if your child is doing things that they shouldn't be doing then okay. Take acting. I also agree that a child shouldn't be taught sex and shown either what females have and what boys have on their body. Their mind shouldn't even be set on that. Books, movies, and shows shouldn't be removed because they show what life is about and what is going to happen when you get older. They serve as a gentle introduction to the complexities of the real world, preparing young minds for the future in a controlled environment.
1787	4764	2	3	Debates are a main part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, that to the people being described in the book may seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures. Our businesses are in other countries, many people living in America speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that may in fact be offensive to a race of people. Businesses thrive in other countries. A lot of our country's income is from our factories and companies in other countries. China is a place where much business happens for the United States. If we, as Americans, can't learn about the Chinese, how can we learn their business methods and way of life? To the Chinese, these books may be offensive, but to us they are learning tools describing Chinese culture. Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics. The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force. Learning about their language and habits comes from books. The Mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them. In the United States, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as Americans use freely. Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in America. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us. It's a common theme around the globe. Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely. This is the same case with other populations of people. They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted, as it is through this exposure that we build a more interconnected and understanding global community.
1788	4765	2	3	Books are very important to our society. They hold a special place in our hearts, and contain much of our world's knowledge. Everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books. I definitely agree that little children should not purchase a book that has explicit content in it that they should not read. However, some people, myself included, have checked out or bought books and then realized what exactly was portrayed in those books. I do not believe that anything that contains certain contents should be removed from the shelves. I can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves. Any books about the Civil War and even the World Wars, such as 'The Red Badge of Courage' can be taken in the wrong context. These books do contain language that is not appropriate for children. But we do still see them on our shelves. Why? Because those books, and many others, are very important to us. Books should stay on their shelves because, as Katherine Paterson cleverly put it, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' She means that if everyone took out books that they felt were personally offensive then there would be no books. Books are vital to learning things. We put all of our knowledge into them, even hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. When the libraries in Alexandria were burned and/or destroyed, we thought our knowledge was gone forever. Thank goodness for the back-up system that no one had known about out in the desert. I myself have read the Bible. I believe it whole-heartedly, but I do know of people who do not believe in the Lord and have taken some things that are said in the Bible to be taken personally. I believe that the Bible is the most important book in the world. Without the Bible no one would know of the wonderful things that our Lord above has done for us, and what he is doing for us now. However, some people can take what the Bible says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces. But would we allow the gays or divorced men and women to take the Bible off of the shelves? Of course not! If we would not allow them to take off that ever so important book, then why should we allow to have other books to be removed? Books are so very important to us and our world. They hold our world's knowledge, and they also hold our hearts. Just think about what our world, our knowledge, our society would be like if we did not have these precious things. Can you imagine it? I cannot. Books are one of the most important things that we have in our world. Just because someone finds something offensive in a written work does not mean that everyone else will, too. Books, if they are offensive to anyone, should be kept on our shelves for our future generations to come so they may learn and grow on our knowledge of our past.
1789	4766	2	3	In today's world, children are exposed to a lot more inappropriate things than in recent times. They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work. One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about. Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not. This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. Also, Christian books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. In schools across the country, many Christian authors are not in the public school libraries. By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them. Another issue libraries have is music and movies. It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie. But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. What can the general public do about this? Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above PG-13 should be a definite no in libraries. If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out. Magazines also offer a source of learning. Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that are not suited for children. Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. The magazine Cosmopolitan, for example, has articles that are too bawdy for students to read. Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation. America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. Society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process. Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not, ensuring a safer and more appropriate environment for young minds to develop.
1790	4767	2	3	This is going to be an essay about if people finding something offensive in a library or in music that it should be censored. It is also about if you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offensive. The way I look or my own opinion is that they should censor most things from libraries and music, but not get rid of it because one person finds it offensive. If you think about it those uncensored materials like books that some people find offensive might be a fit book for someone else to what they can relate to as they were growing up. On the other hand they should be more careful about it so when younger kids listen to the radio or are reading a book they don't get the wrong ideas. We should censor things but only with an extent and not go over board with it. In the long run it might help with a more clean and safe population because we are censoring things to where people don't hear bad and only hear the good in life. You never know you could make a big difference by doing that. The reason I wouldn't go out and censor everything is because you can't stop everyone from doing it. You can always give it a try but that's one of the main reasons why I wouldn't try and get rid of it cause a certain person might find it offensive. I can understand if you took it off their shelf that someone found offensive but only move it to where no one will find it offensive. I'm not saying it's wrong to do that but I think it could and probably would make a lot of people angry. But hey what can I say what has the government done that we don't like or can't do anything about it. And that's all I have to say about that, concluding that a balanced approach to censorship is the most reasonable path forward for our diverse society.
1791	4768	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, music, and other media make up a huge part of our entertainment system in our lives today. Whether it be informational or just purely for entertainment, many diverse forms of entertainment are found in your local library today, whereas in the past most libraries only contained books and reference materials. Although, our entertainment today is much different then it was back then and will be much different than it will be in the future. In today's society books, magazines, music, movies, and so on can be found in your local library, and contain many different types of material. Some material could be informational about our solar system or about the human body. Other material could be a fiction story filled with action, horror, or love. Some material could also be filled with true, life changing, and inspirational stories. Which ever it may be, these types of things may come off as offensive to some people more than others and may not be appropriate for younger ages. Certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., containing offensive, inappropriate, or rude material shouldn't be banned from libraries, just because those younger than adults should not read them, or because those who dislike the material believe that that material does not belong in the library. Generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building. One area might be for fiction books and another for non-fiction books, another area could be for childrens books, and another for magazines, movies, music, etc., all based on different types and genres. Simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens. Take the books that may contain offensive material, or may be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library. When a book from that section is being checked out merely ask for an ID from the person checking that book out to make sure that they are of age. This can also apply to movies, magazines, music, and so on that are placed in that section. Some materials found in libraries that may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to others. Taking those offensive materials out of the library won't benefit everyone and would disappoint some of the people who don't find that material offensive. Placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go to benefit everyone. As you can see just because one person may find certain material in magazines, books, music, movies, etc., offensive, rude, or inappropriate, doesn't mean that everyone else does. It also doesn't mean you should completely take out and get rid of all the materials that are found to contain offensive or inappropriate material. Dividing those specific materials into their own section, and regulating who may check them out is really the best way to go. It benefits everyone at best so that those who want to read that material can still go to their library and check out that book, magazine, and so on, and those who wish to not have anything to do with that certain material don't have to worry about finding material that is offensive or inappropriate, because they will be in their own divided section.
1792	4769	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship. Different sections in the library should be offered. Everyone has different opinions on what they like to read or watch. You should do what you want at your own risk. I think the censorship should not affect the library. The library should offer different sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group. The kids should not have to worry about censorship because they should not be offered any thing that a librarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the library. A teen side should not have censorship because a lot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much. Books that teenagers read are most likely to have foul language and inappropriate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influence them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known? An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything. Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the shelves. They already know of a lot of things. Why get rid of books that others may read. It is a library so it should just offer things that would increase intelligence not decrease it. The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk. Things in movies, books, magazines are that are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when there all around you. If someone finds something offensive then let it be there are many things offensive in today's society. You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out. You enter the library at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose. The library is full of different opinions and a lot of different likes and dislikes. If you should not be looking at something then it is your opinion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys different things like, movies, books, magazines, and music. If the library had a censorship they would loose a lot of materials all due to opinions of people that did not care about others opinions. Everyone enjoys different things and wants a wide variety of the things they like. The library is where you go when you need books, movies, and etc. Why close someones opinion of book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read. I believe that the censorship should not affect the library. The library should offer different sections for certain age groups. The books and magazines and music at the library should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has different opinions at the library. The censorship would be a bad decision if they did go through with this decision. The library would not offer as many things and most likely less things would be getting checked out. Therefore I do think that the censorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries.
1793	4770	2	3	I personally think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.; should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First of all how do we define offensive? Is it something that discriminates a certain group of people? Is it something that creates negative attention? Is it something we don't like? Anybody can walk in a library and find something they did not like, but that does not automatically mean it is offensive. The national geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people and so does the art magazine. So which one would we have to put censorship on? The answer is we don't put one because this would start a big argument of which is offensive and which is not. It would cause a conflict of two different sides. It is only offensive when we make it offensive. We do not have to look at something we don't like. We all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive. The Christians may not get along with the Muslims but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves, they cannot say one's book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs. We sometimes forget we have the amendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press. We may not like what one person publishes but it doesn't make their work offensive because it might be for a certain of group that likes it, which is not offensive to them. Everything in the library has a purpose and if it does not fit our purpose then there is no way it would be offensive to us. The library is a place for books, music, movies, magazines, etc. We come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn. We also go to the library to read the newest book of a series. Putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these. We can't finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive or we can't listen to new album Dr. Dre released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive. Putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content and satisfied with the available selection.
1794	4771	2	3	We all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine their not suppose to read. Children don't know any better. But why should we have to have movies, books and etc censored, cause their little children every where. If i had the right to keep the books and etc on the shelf i would. I think that we should be able to have books that are uncensored on the shelfs. If everything was censored we would really have nothing to read or to watch. Having everything censored thats just not fair to the world. Everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored. If people favorite movies or music was censored it probably wouldnt be that funny to them anymore, they'll most likely just stop watching it. I don't believe that they should have a censorship in libraries. Certain materials in like cd's songs do come off little offensive sometimes, but that's just life. If you think it's offensive then just don't listen to it. That doesnt mean that they have to take it off the shelf. Maybe other people like that kind of music or etc. That doesnt mean they have a right just to take it off cause of that. If they did that's just really unfair. Children now days see more and know more what they are not suppose to know, for an example cursing. If a child happen to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents got mad that was in the magazine. The parent shouldnt really be mad and take that offensive, and think that not suppose to be in their. The library shouldn't have to censor thing's cause of that incident. The children will hear it or see it again soon or later. I would keep the right for the libraires to have things uncensored, if i had the decision. Those are some ideas why i think they shouldnt have to censor movies, music etc in the library, as personal choice and responsibility are paramount in a free society.
1795	4772	2	3	Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies. Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want. Some of the literature and other material you may find in libraries however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children. Censorship takes material that these certain people should not read away from everyone. Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life. Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general category. Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else. Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness. Everyone finds something offensive. Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persecute someone who is interested in the subject matter. For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple. Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children may choose material appropriate for their age range, which is a more effective solution than broad censorship. More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced. Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading. By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like. This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people, fostering a more inclusive and knowledgeable community.
1796	4773	2	3	The author is writing about the practice of taking books off the shelves that adults deem inappropriate. They remove books that contain bad words or pictures. However, I do not really believe that they should take them out because these books can be interesting, well, some of them are. I am not a fan of reading; I don't really like it but I have to do it anyway, and I don't think these books should be removed. I don't really think they should be taken out for several reasons; it's better to have them so kids can read and learn about the pictures. Some books aren't that bad for kids, like for elementary kids, the only books they like are the ones with pictures in them. The high school and middle school kids like the chapter kind of books and interesting stories. The parents would like them to have educational books that will help the kids learn new words and school-related stuff. The books the adults want are the kind that have meaning, that have a lot of knowledge and school-related material. They want their kids to learn about what they are reading. But yeah, I don't think they should take out the books that they have; they should just leave them for the kids because they are at least educational to them. So the adults would have more educational students to rely on in the future.
1797	4774	2	3	I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and beliefs on certain types of things, particularly regarding religion, culture, and sexuality. Some people can be offended by it, but others might be informed and learn new facts that they didn't already know. People are not going to look at things the same way. Everyone has their own way of life and thinks differently. If one person feels a book was offensive to them and they take it off the shelves, then one by one people would find other materials offensive, and what does that leave us with? No more books, music, movies, and magazines. Let's face it, everyone has different beliefs, values, and purposes, but taking materials off the shelves because they are found offensive is ridiculous to me. I say if they find it offensive, don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offended over a movie? Don't watch it again, and the same with music—don't listen to it again. It's as easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things from them. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines, we wouldn't be as smart as we are today. America is about being free and having the right to speak our minds, so removing materials from shelves is not the answer to dealing with offensive content.
1798	4775	2	3	Yes, we should keep the books, music, movies, and magazines. The magazines and music might not be a good thing for some of us, but most people use music to concentrate on doing work, and magazines help us get topics for class work. Why would someone take books or anything away that helps us in life? The person who wants to take books away should leave the books or anything else alone. So, regarding this, yes we should keep the books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves. We need to start fighting for what we want and how we want it; it should not be anyone else's choice to decide what is good for us and what we can access for our education and entertainment.
1799	4776	2	3	I do believe that books, magazines, music, movies, and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine, they would just have to wait until it is returned to the shelf. If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie, they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think: what are books, magazines, movies, music, and etc., for and why are they on the shelves if you can't read, listen, or watch them? Books and magazines should be read and not just sit there being displayed. Music should be listened to and movies should be watched. The reason why I agree with the fact that magazines and books should be taken off the shelf is because they were made to entertain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader's attention. Another reason why I think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new things. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classroom book and you learn different things like math, you learn about history, or you learn about different things in English class. Magazines and books were made so that different people can take them off a shelf and look through them, even if they only want to look at the pictures if it has pictures. The reason why I think music should be taken off the shelf is to listen to different genres such as rap, rock and roll, gospel, or rhythm and blues and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf because it was meant to be heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person's life or what goes on in their heads. Music can inspire people in different ways. Music is a part of life and most people in the world like to listen to the different artists that inspire them. The reason why I think movies should be taken off the shelf is because they are meant to be watched, not just sit and let the movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different things, such as become an actor. Movies tell different stories, such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored. To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books, and music off the shelf, but put them back so that other people can enjoy the thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music and reading magazines and books can help people in life and can also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons, so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good; you won't regret it in the long run. You'll be surprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening, and watching.
1800	4777	2	3	Different Then Everyone Else Why do people find small things offensive? My opinion is that everyone has their own idea of what can be offensive to them. There are so many small things that can be offensive, like books, movies, and music. It's not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf that you might think is offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate against someone for their own belongings or choices. Books can be a way to learn new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more than what a person can with their own words. There are so many books that can be a little offensive to people and even kids. I know that a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf about a difficult topic when they are learning about it. Sure, it is not a nice thing to read about, but really, parents should think about it. Don't you think we kids need to know what the topic really means? A book can tell us in a good way or in a bad way, but we can learn from it, and you don't even have to talk about it directly. Movies are similar to books in one way: you can see in action what they are trying to teach everyone. I know that some movies are horrible. It's a horrible movie to watch, but really we need to know what really happened to those people. And even if a teacher is telling you, sometimes you have to see it with your own eyes to believe it. A good way is to watch the movie and learn from it. Music has a lot of ways of being offensive to people, but singers use it as their way of expressing their own feelings about stuff. We can't really discriminate against anyone for their own beliefs. There are so many singers who use a lot of bad words in their songs, but that's how he gets his own feelings out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you, it's more about their own opinion, just like we all have different opinions than others. My opinion about feeling offended is that we all are different and have an opinion about it, and we need to respect that. Especially if I wanted to learn new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me, I would want a book or a movie to learn from. And parents, just because I'm reading a book, or watching a movie, or listening to music about bad stuff, don't assume I'm going to do those things; I would just want to learn about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf, especially if I want to read it. Remember, it's your own opinion about the book; not everyone is different from you in what they find acceptable or valuable.
