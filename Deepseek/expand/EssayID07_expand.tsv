1	17834	7	3	Patience is when you are waiting calmly for something. I was patient when standing in the long line waiting for my school lunch. I didn’t cut anyone to get my food sooner. I was just standing there quietly and waiting for my proper turn. Patience is a virtue, but some people simply don’t have it. Lots of people just cut in front of you or yell at you because they don’t have any patience. Sometimes people will even push you out of their way to get ahead. They only do that because they don’t have patience at all. Patience is what people really need in these situations. People need patience because without it, lots of feelings can get hurt. Everyone should have patience to make waiting easier for all.

But there was one specific time I was truly patient, and I bet everyone else has been too, like when riding a bike for the first time without training wheels. When I was five years old and learned how to ride a bike, I just kept falling off. At one point, my bike flipped over completely and I almost broke my jaw, but thankfully I didn’t. It was a scary moment. Finally, after several weeks of constant falling and getting back up, I rode for a full five minutes without falling and finally learned how to ride a bike properly. It felt like a great accomplishment.

So after we did our suicides, which is a tough running exercise, I asked the coach if we could go get some drinks. The coach said, “after our double dribble down and back exercise.” I did the exercise as fast as I could, and then we all rushed to the drinking fountain. I found myself at the end of a long line of girls. I waited and waited patiently until finally I was next, faced with that drinking fountain, when one girl suddenly said, “Can I have a drink, thank you?” and cut right in front. All I could do was be stunned. That’s when I heard a bright lady, the coach, yell “Let’s go!” I was really mad but I quickly took a two-second drink of water and rushed over to the coach. Now I’m the first one to the fountain a lot, and I take long drinks, so my teammates call me a fish!

Suddenly, we noticed that the line had grown very long and we were now at the very end of it. So my mother said, “Maybe we should get on another ride then.” My father replied, “We already tried all the other rides.” So we decided to stay at the end of the line until it was finally our turn. They said that was the last ride of the night, and soon there were people behind us complaining. Their younger children were getting mad, and parents were hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t disturb us at all, since we were raised to be patient and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s really just the line moving slow. My advice is this: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, because it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you; talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, and then you’ll notice the line is moving quicker than you expected. We really enjoyed the ride in the end.

For example, when you go to the dentist or doctor’s office, you need to be very patient. There was a girl who had to go to the dentist for a check-up. She really hated the dentist. It was always so boring and took forever. First, you’d sit there in the waiting room while your parents did a whole bunch of paperwork. You have to just sit there for like twenty minutes before you even go into the exam room. Then, when you finally go in, they start working on your teeth for like ten minutes, then you’d sit there in the chair for another fifteen minutes waiting for the dentist to come. Finally, when you are done getting your teeth cleaned, you’d sit there for another ten minutes while your parents talk to the dentist about your teeth. So, you really need to be patient sometimes, even when you are just dying of boredom. It is a necessary part of life.
6	17840	7	3	There was a girl named @PERSON1. She deeply loved spending time with her mom. Every weekend they would either @CAPS3 the movies, visit an amusement or water park, or just stay home together. This time was different though. @PERSON1 was even a little scared about what @CAPS1 was about @CAPS3 happen. Today was a @DATE1 and @PERSON1 and her mom was watching old videos of her mom when she was young. After the video ended, @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and laughed fondly. Once they settled down, @PERSON1’s mom looked unexpectedly sad. “@CAPS1’s wrong mom?” @PERSON1 asked with concern. “I have @CAPS3 go. I have @CAPS3 go somewhere for work and can’t take you with me,” mom replied softly. “@CAPS2 not?” asked @PERSON1, her voice trembling. “I don’t know, but I need you @CAPS3 wait here with your father. I’ll be back soon,” the mom said calmly, trying to reassure her. With that, @PERSON1’s mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there confused and wishing her mom didn’t have @CAPS3 go. Then she went @CAPS3 the phone and called her dad, her fingers shaking. An hour later, @PERSON1’s dad came @CAPS3 her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom terribly. @PERSON1 went @CAPS3 her room and began @CAPS3 wait patiently for her mom’s return. Weeks past and @PERSON1’s mom still hasn’t returned. Every night now @PERSON1 cried hoping her mom would come home. During the day she would wait by the window, watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though she never complained @CAPS3 her father and understands that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom. Two years have passed since @PERSON1’s mom had left. @PERSON1 didn’t cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother @CAPS3 come back. One day @PERSON1 heard a soft knock on the door, she answered it and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, just looking at each other, then hugged each other tightly. They both cried and her mom whispered “I’m sorry.” @CAPS3 @PERSON1. Now @PERSON1 and her were unseperatable. They never left each other’s side again, their bond stronger than ever before.
7	17841	7	3	Un Patience @CAPS1. My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a handsome chestnut quarter horse with a bright white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go, full of restless energy. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post; he fidgets and shifts his weight constantly. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the rest of the group. And that’s when he gets unpatient, tossing his head and prancing in place. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around in small circles and walk him back to the others. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient with treats and gentle words but I have always failed to change his nature. I guess he just always has to be doing something, always moving forward. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is, for his spirit is part of who he is.
8	17842	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I preordered a videogame called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I preordered it a full month before it came out and I couldn’t wait for it to be released. I mostly wanted it because @ORGANIZATION1 is the company that makes it and this was the last game @ORGANIZATION1 was making because some other company bought the @CAPS1 series from them. The wait felt long, checking the calendar each day. When the game finally came out on @DATE1 fourteenth two thousand ten, I bought it with my friends and the game is absolutely amazing. I would give it a solid four of five stars. I’m not absessed with it through, I have other interests. I play it only about two hours a day which is all my parensts let me play any way. Hala @CAPS2 is my very favorite game, and the patience I showed in waiting for it made finally playing it all the more rewarding.
9	17843	7	3	One time I was patience it was when I wanted a phone. I didn’t get a phone right away but I knew I was gonna get one someday, so I waited. The day finally came to get my phone on @DATE1; it was my @NUM1 birthday. I was opening presents and I didn’t know what I was getting but the last and final big present was a cell phone, wrapped in shiny paper. So I called my friend on it immediately and she said whose phone are you calling from I said my own. I couldn’t believe I could be so patience for such a long time, waiting for that moment. I was so happy that I could be so patience for so long. I did not know someone could be so patience for so long, but I had managed it. Once I got my phone I wasn’t patience for waiting for a texted message to come back to me; I would check the screen constantly. After all I got patience and just waited until I got the text message back, learning to calm my excitement. I wish I could be patience everyday but can’t do that, it’s a challenge. I’m happy that I have a phone so I can call my mom after all my activitys and then I know she is on her way and I will be patience with her: could I ever be more patience? Some days I am never patience with anything, I get frustrated easily. One day I will teach someone to be patience to me and I will be happy to do that, to share what I learned. But some day and every day after that I will be patience for everybody, or at least I will try my best. I wish everybody will be patience some day. Patience means you will just wait for that day or moment of live, trusting it will come. This a time when I was patience and when I want other people to be patience. I hope someday everybody in the world will be patience with everybody. Will you please help other people to be patient and then they could teach someone new every day, creating a chain of understanding? I will be patience or trie to be patience and wait for another thing to happen in life, embracing the quiet moments. I hope you are patience at times too, finding value in the wait. Thanks for reading the time I was patience and times when I want to be patience. Hope you enjoyed his story and perhaps saw a little of yourself in it.
10	17844	7	3	I think patience is a time when you have to be calm and control your feelings. It is also a time of wateing, of letting things unfold in their own time. For some people being patient is extremely hard, a real struggle against their impulses. But for me it’s often easy, a natural state of mind. At times I can be inpatient, but everyone can be; nobody is perfect. Being patient is kinda new racking, a test of your nerves, but I manage to get through it. A lot of times I get mad if I have to be too patient, if the wait stretches on for too long. I think @PERCENT1 of people in the world don’t like to be patient and prefer instant results. But with patience comes a reward if you are really patient, a sweet feeling of accomplishment and peace.
11	17845	7	3	You know that life is so much harder when you don’t have the patience. If you don’t then I’m going to tell you why. There was a time that I found out I was going to @LOCATION1; now that’s the good part but when I ask “how are we getting there?” we had to fly and right then and there I knew I was going to have to be very patient and I thought I didn’t have enough patience to fly to @LOCATION1. Although I got through it, the flight felt long and cramped. Now the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1 it was very hot out. We had to stand outside on the hot pavement to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patience and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn’t want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha I came to my senses and I started out and it was way easier to wait and the bus eventually showed up and I already felt way better, proving that a little patience really does make everything easier in the end.
12	17846	7	3	One nice sunny day I was trapped in a doctor’s office with no air conditioning. This doctor’s office had @NUM1 chairs in the dirty waiting room, which was painted a dull, pale green. I was already crammed in the room with about @NUM2 people for @NUM3 minutes, and the air was thick and still. I was trying to be patient but the patience was wearing off. Sweat dripped off of my face on to my black @PERSON1 short-@CAPS1 shirt, leaving a small dark spot. I was starting to get hot and mad, but I kept my patience, focusing on a worn-out poster on the wall. I know if I was going to get mad even more, it wouldn’t help or make the time faster. Then all of a sudden, “creeeeeck,” the door opened with a slow, heavy sound. A tall white woman with green scrubs on said, “@CAPS2,” and finally, my wait was over.
13	17847	7	3	A time I was patient was @DATE1, when I was in line to ride the dragster in @CAPS1 point. It was a super hot day, I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were getting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever, making my shirt stick to my back. Just as we were about to go on the ride they stopped us because the ride wasn’t working right, and a collective groan went through the crowd. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins, just standing there in the heat. Luckily my best friend and I had good patience unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes, grumbling loudly. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experiences of my life, a thrilling blur of speed. “I’m so happy we waited” said @PERSON1 my best friend, grinning from ear to ear. Some people have patience like @PERSON1 and I, and some don’t like the people who ran off there. I’m glad we waited or that would not have happened, and we would have missed out on that incredible feeling. In this case patience was a great thing for @PERSON1 and I, rewarding us with a memory we still laugh about.
14	17849	7	3	One day, my soccer team was in the championship game and we were facing the Lions. At the start of the game I was on the bench; I was the worst on my team, so I understood. After the @DATE1 we were up @NUM1 but my coach still put me on the bench and I just sat there and cheered for my team, clapping for every good play. The next two quarters went by and it was a tie game @NUM2, the tension on the field growing. Half way through the @DATE2 our star player got hurt so coach put me in, my heart suddenly pounding. I had no clue what to do; I was just chasing the ball around the field, trying to keep up. With one minute left I was standing by their goalie and one of my teammates shot the ball; it zinged through the air and hit me square in the foot. The ball redirected into the goal and my team started to cheer; we were up @NUM3. After the @DATE2 minute was done the horn went off and everyone cheered again and lifted me up onto their shoulders. That’s how patience helped me succeed and become a hero for my team when my moment finally arrived.
15	17850	7	3	This is about a story where I was patient; I was on an @LOCATION1 “@LOCATION1”, so this is what happened on the @LOCATION1. I was standing in line and ordered some sausages, eggs, pancakes with syrup, hash browns and orange juice and took my cool derille, sitting near a man with a steak on his head who ordered something and sits down, and I got mad a little though I’m still patient okay but then I’m really mad because the steak head gets his food before mine and he walked in here first. So then I cool down because a nice cute girl walks in, orders, and comes and sits down where I was sitting, giving me a small smile. Then an old couple, I think they’re going on a trip, they order and sit down, chatting quietly. Finally, the girl and I finally get our food and show the old people what’s up is we challenged them to a surf contest but the main thing is to sit and wait and be patient even through it was @NUM1 in the @TIME1, and in the end, my breakfast was worth the long and frustrating wait.
16	17851	7	3	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Being patient is hard for some people but easy for others. I’m not a very patient person. I’ll tell about a time when I was patient, which was the only time. One time, me, my mom, and my sister we went to the doctor because my sister had a doctor's appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said “about fifteen minutes.” So I said ok. When we arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no I’ll wait in the car. Once I was inside of the car waiting and I got bored and turned the music on and this was maybe about five or ten minutes in. About twenty minutes later I got tired of listening to music. Then I tried to fall asleep. That didn’t work so I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight. It was almost an hour and my mom and sister come walking out. That's a time I was patient, and I felt proud of myself for waiting so long without complaining.
17	17852	7	3	One day John went to school pretty early in the morning. He went in just as if it were a normal day, and goes to his first class in the seventh grade. He chatted with his friends all first period and then class was over. Then he goes to second hour science and there is a lab with partners. So him and Mike decide to be partners. Half way through the lab they don't know what to do. Then John goes up to the teacher and interrupts her and another student. The teacher says I'll be with you in a moment, but he continues to bug her. As a result, he got a step. Then later that day he was in social studies and was working on a worksheet but the teacher was talking with the principal. This time he decided to wait for her to be done so he wouldn’t get in trouble, but it was taking much longer than expected so he moved to the next problems. Then the teacher comes back and he got her help. In conclusion, John learned two lessons that day. One was that you can get in trouble for being impatient and get a step. Two was that if you are polite and courteous in class and be patient you can get the reward of getting a better citizenship grade, which John did that day.
18	17853	7	3	I recall once a famous magician named David Blaine was performing a stunt that took enormous amounts of patience and courage; it was named “Frozen In Time.” The magician had to stay in a block of ice for two days or sixty hours! The great magician had only a sweater. He had the enclosed ice open to the public as the magnificent magician said “I could barely hear anything.” He waited hours on end, feeling like falling down into an abyss or a bottomless pit. Until the final seconds ended. The magician was finally free, and alive, having proven his incredible endurance to the world.
19	17854	7	3	One day, a few years ago, I woke up and my mom said we were going to my grandma’s house. So I started to get ready. After I was done getting dressed I looked on my dresser and grabbed my twenty dollars that I was saving up to buy something just in case we went to the store. When we got there I saw my cousin’s dad Tom walking a puppy. I walked up to him and asked about the dog, he said it was his brother's dog and he was selling it. My mom said I could get a dog so I asked him how much did he cost. Tom said fifteen dollars. I got really excited because I had twenty dollars and could get the rest from my grandma. So I called my mom but she was busy somewhere else but she told me that she wanted to see the dog before I buy him. So Tom waited there for hours but my mom took forever. Then finally I got impatient and bought him. But my mom wasn’t mad because she ended up liking him, and we took the puppy home with us.
20	17856	7	3	The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy; I wanted a lollipop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was five minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy without saying a word. There was another day like that. It was at the carnival; I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the lifeguard instructor for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for half an hour. I was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complain or argue about the man who was wasting our time, and I eventually got to enjoy the ride.
21	17857	7	3	One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gym as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway one by one. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the ‘A’ team and the ‘B’ team. Finally there was about five other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was intense!  At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the ‘B’ team. Although it wasn’t the ‘A’ team I was still happy I didn’t get cut. That was a day I had to be very patient, and it taught me the value of waiting calmly for an outcome.
22	17858	7	3	A time that I was patient was last year at cheer competition. In the beginning of the day I was patient getting in line to get ready to perform. Once we were ready we were waiting backstage to go to perform. After, we performed we went to watch the rest of the teams. The other teams were really good. Then our team went and had lunch while some of the teams were still performing. We had to wait til all the teams were done. Once the teams were done they called all the squads to the mat it was award time. All the teams sat down on the mat. My team members were waiting patiently to see if we won in cheer or in dance. We waited… and waited… and waited till finally he called our name. The junior varsity cheer leaders! We took first in dance and fourth in cheer. That day was a good day for me and I was very patient and being patient can turn out right or not the way you wanted it to be. You never know till it happens. That is a time when I was patient at cheer competition.
23	17859	7	3	I'm writing about the time I was patient at a Nuggets game. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the Denver vs. the New York Nuggets in Denver. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a two and a half hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the two and a half hour drive. When we got to the arena the Denver and Nuggets were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the Denver ended up winning. That was the most best birthday I've ever had. Now I don't think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that I'm older. I will never forget that birthday again, and the lesson in patience it taught me.
24	17860	7	3	Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have severe anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are Christian and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didn't say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems I'm very surprised I didn't go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance towards children… I don't like kids too much but where I used to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I said those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are “guardian parents” they are the worst they tell you what to do and they ain't even your parents but I tolerated it, and that was a significant test of my patience.
25	17861	7	3	One time I was patient was when we were going up north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over five hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to Mackinaw City from Nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient, especially during long journeys with family.
26	17862	7	3	Patience is very important. But I'm not very good with my patience. And when I am patient and I wait my turn, I end up forgetting what I was going to say. I guess I'm not very patient because my family is not very patient either. My family is not very patient because we just want to say what we're going to say before we forget it. Our family is also very forgetful. That is probably another reason why we aren't patient. Patience is important because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait your turn. That is all I know about patience, and it is a valuable quality to have.
27	17863	7	3	Patience is when you can take your time at something. When you're able to wait, not in a hurry pushing, shoving, and rushing like something bad is about to happen. Being patient also means that you are understanding when it comes to tolerance, and it is when you are calm, cool, peaceful, and full of love. It is a state of mind that allows you to handle delays or problems without becoming annoyed or anxious, which makes life more pleasant for everyone involved.
28	17864	7	3	When I was patient was when I went down the river with my dad and my two sisters. The only way I'm patient is when my dad says we are going from north to the location. So I have no choice but to be patient because it is a two-hour trip. But there is a train track bridge that my dad likes to use, and we get off of the boat to take a break and eat some lunch. The bridge is about a one-hour ride down the river if you go all the way, but when just me and my dad go, we just float the whole way, enjoying the slow journey together.
29	17865	7	3	"Patience? I am not a patient type of person. I am a fan of a certain person. He played in a movie which I really wanted to see, which came out on a specific date that I haven't even seen yet. One day I was sitting on my porch where I asked my mom to take me to the theater and see the movie that was released, when she said ""we'll see"" I was really upset because I wanted to see it really really bad. I was being very patient at the time. I had called my relatives, my friends, my sisters and brothers to save me a spot, but they said they were busy so I cried myself to sleep. The next few days my mom and dad were talking about going to the movies and out to dinner. I walked in screaming and yelling about why they weren't taking me to see the movie, and then I left the room. The very next day my brother and his girlfriend went to see it, knowing I wanted to go. They came home teasing me saying how good the movie was. So that night I went down stairs to demand to go see the movie, saying ""I am being very patient with you all about taking me to see it, but you all are pushing my buttons so I demand to go tomorrow."" I waited a few seconds and she said that I could go this weekend. That was the very first time that I was patient, and I'm proud of myself, I can't wait to see my favorite actor in the film."
30	17867	7	3	I am not a patient person at all. But sometimes I have to be, like with my birthday for instance; I would love it if my birthday came at least every month. But of course, I only have one birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person, but it’s just not in the cards for me. My father, on the other hand, is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car, and when I told him I didn’t do it yet, he said he would give me more time. I couldn’t be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldn’t force them to or anything, but I’m not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned. I guess I could try to be as patient as my father, but that would be really hard. Although if I am patient, I’m sure I will be able to do it and become a better person for it.
31	17868	7	3	Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied for the army and was soon accepted. His dad has been absent for most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend, was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year for deployment. @PERSON1 knew why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind in understanding because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 began to understand the army and also it was the time their dad was injured in the leg by a machete. When their dad came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. @PERSON1 isn’t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn’t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks he's nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don’t know if they’ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I’ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad.
32	17869	7	3	Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant of delays or problems without becoming annoyed or anxious. I have been patient many times. For instance when my mom uses the phone late at night, I wait patiently till she gets off so I can talk to her. Before events like plays or movies you have to be patient until the movie or play begins, sitting quietly in your seat. I am most patient during tests at school. Like this one, the main point is that patience is very important. If you don't have patience, to some people that is annoying. If I didn't have patience I would be a completely different person; people would mind me very much and every day they would @CAPS1 get along with me so instead of bothering someone, @CAPS2-stop and be patient.
33	17870	7	3	Long ago in the land of @LOCATION1 there was a young boy named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 wanted to become a ninja like the rest of the older boys but he was too young, he was only six years old. One day @CAPS1 came running home, he wasn’t just running he was flipping and twirling; @CAPS1 was acting like a firework. @CAPS1 came bursting through the door and said, “Mama mama I'm @CAPS2 old enough to be a ninja!” said @CAPS1, and kins mom said, “Well, sorry you can’t; ninja training isn’t till another six years,” said kins mother. “Why now when I @CAPS2 turn twelve?” @CAPS1 replied. “Well the sensai is still on his training journey, so you’ll have to be patient,” she explained. So @CAPS1 waited six long years, practicing on his own, and @CAPS2 finally became a ninja.
34	17871	7	3	Once in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young man named @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everything, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal. As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their arrows and shimmied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane, and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready; because of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared at him. Unblinking pupils dilated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the dane fled into the treeline. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?” whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 was too far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 without pain,” @PERSON2 replied simply. The next day the pair returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready, but @PERSON2 had rights to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane’s rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was staring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply stepped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?” whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6’s back turned,” @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walked through the grove from the left this time, giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank. This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies true and pierces the animal's lungs and heart. “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased,” @PERSON2 states as he carries his kill from the woods. In the end, patience rewards better than impatience, yielding an honorable and clean kill. No matter the circumstances, it is a virtue that brings greater rewards.
35	17872	7	3	One time when I was patient was when me and my family went on a fishing trip to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. Once we got on the boat it took @NUM1 minutes to go through the river before reaching the fishing spot. Then at @NUM2 we just waited, trolling through the open water. Rocking side to side like a baby in its crib. Setting up all the poles and lures took some time as well. Then around @NUM3 we got our first hit on one of the lines. My dad rushed over to get the pole and started reeling as fast as he could. Eventually he got it in; it was a @ORGANIZATION1 at @MONEY1. Then around @NUM4, another pole got a hit; I rushed over, grabbed the pole, and started reeling it in. With some help from my dad, my fish turned out to be a king @ORGANIZATION1 that came in at @NUM5 pounds and @NUM6 inches tall. That is why it always helps to be patient on the water. You never know what’s going to happen if you are patient and wait for the fish to bite.
36	17873	7	3	"A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive, which felt like an eternity to a young child. It is the funniest place to go to, full of games and space to run around. I was so happy I couldnít wait until we got there. I new I had to be patient and just watch the scenery go by outside the car window. But I wanted to get there so bad, to jump out and start the fun immediately. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble, so I bit my tongue. I know that because I had to learn the way the hard way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long, asking ""Are we there yet?"" over and over. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandmaís cottage I didnít complain, not even a single sigh. Not complaining is smart to do because it makes the trip more pleasant for everyone. If you are unpatient donít go on long trips, as you will only make yourself and others miserable. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me and gave me a smile. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person, and they will appreciate your good attitude."
37	17874	7	3	One time I went in the orthodontist's office and I had to sit in the visiting room/ area for about twenty min- thirty mins, just flipping through old magazines. I really didnít care, because I had to go to school after I was done you could tell any me in was not very happy because your only sapose to be waiting for fifteen minutes, not twice that long. I finally got in and went to sit in the chair and they took my rubber bands off and I had to sit there and wait for about another ten minutes, staring at the bright ceiling light. I was still being patient, because I didnít want to go to school and miss the appointment entirely. I donít like coming in the middle of class, because everybody stares at you when you walk in late. The doctor finaly came to check on me then I got different color rubber bands on, a nice blue this time. Also the doctor came to see me and see if my bracese were all right, tightening a few wires. I finaly got out of the orthodontist oficce and it was about noon so I got to go home and I was happy that my patience had paid off and I didn't have to face a classroom of staring eyes.
38	17875	7	3	Their was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop and my family and I was going on a trip and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop was packed with people so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair, which gave me some hope. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted, trying not to look annoyed. After those people were done he never call me up so he got on his phone and went outside for a few minutes, leaving me wondering what was happening. Then he told me wait until he came out the restroom then five more people came in so thatís when my mom called my phone and asked me was I done because I been up their from two o'clock to four o'clock and she said go to some one else chair because was was about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff will be leaving at six a.m the next morning, so I knew I had to get the haircut done somehow, even if it meant waiting even longer at another shop.
39	17876	7	3	One summer week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over for a visit. We went to my grandmotherís sisters house and my grandmother and aunt (my grandmotherís sister) were going to teach me hoe to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldnít do it for you, so I needed to learn. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited and motivated to try my best! When we got their after I had lunch they began teaching me, sitting with me on the living room floor. The tirck they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop(tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny loving around the tree. Then you put it through (the bunny darling in its hole.) Then youíre bond, with a perfect bow. After many tries, with my fingers fumbling, I was starting to get the hang of it, making a loose but recognizable knot. Later we went back to my house and my grandmother kept helping me, sitting with me on the front steps. Finally one afternoon I got it, my grandmother was happy and she kept telling me good job, giving me a big hug. Later we went to the store and picked something out, a small toy car! My grandmother had to be patient with me through all my failed attempts. She wasnít getting all mad when I kept messing up she just kept being encouraging and patient, showing me the steps again. My grandmother was patient and it helped me learn faster, and I was so proud of myself for finally doing it.
40	17878	7	3	Patience is a very important quality. Being patient means that you needs to make and dor one' thing constantly to make one understand, without showing frustration. That is true patience. My mom is a patient person. When I dart understand a homework problem, she will explain it to me slowly, never in rush. She don't yell a t me when I don't understand, unlike my dad, who is very impatient and gets upset quickly. He would yell, and possiblely cursed at me in chinease, which only made me more confused and nervous. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something with him. But my mom will contune explain to me in a calm voice until I understand what it means, using different examples. Some people might be impatient because of personality triats or because that he or she has high blood pressure, making it hard to stay calm. Patience is something many people have, but it seems like even more people lacks it, which can make learning and living together much more difficult. We should all try to be a little more patient with each other.
41	17879	7	3	I am patient every year for that one special day to come. My birthday is a special day for my mom and dad, as I was the first boy my mom ever had and the only boy my dad had. I am still waiting for my birthday to come again, looking forward to the celebration and the joy it brings to our family.
42	17880	7	3	Swimming is a lot of fun. I enjoy feeling the cool water all around me. Patience is an important part of the swimming experience; you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, during stretching, when waiting for instruction while learning a new stroke, or learning a new way to turn at the wall, etc. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me, it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening and waiting for the instructions to finish. Patience is important for success in the pool and for working together as a team.
43	17881	7	3	Patience, what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in Florida we went to Disney World and we did not have to wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patience is when the miners got stuck in the mine in Chile for sixty-nine days; they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when they were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patience is when you are walking in a group with other people; you have to be patient and listen to their ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient in different situations in life.
44	17882	7	3	A time I was patient was when we were going to Disney World for the first time and I was very excited! We only had one week left to wait to go. But I couldn’t wait that long; I thought I waited long enough already, and I wanted to go at that very moment. Even though I had to wait, I still had a fun time at Disney World; I just had to be patient for that final week to pass, and it was absolutely worth the wait in the end.
45	17883	7	3	I will be writing about patience in my own mix up way even though you are adults. Once there was a little silk worm getting ready to change into a butterfly moth. But this silk worm had a problem: he was still too skinny to change; he had to be nice and fat like a fat pretzel stick cut in half. He crawled from bush to bush eating any green leaf he could find. But here’s where another problem kicked into place. It was becoming winter outside, so every leaf he found was brown and nasty. The grass was changing too. But he wanted to change into a moth so badly that he had no choice but to eat the dead leaves and grass. And he was very patient about it too. But then he got tired of eating dead leaves and grass so he grew more and more impatient because he wanted to change so badly that he exploded… But he woke up to see that he was in a white silk wrapping so he ripped out of it. And he saw he was a moth after all, but then he remembered he was eating nice green leaves together. And wrapped himself up in want to sleep. And that’s how he had that strange dream about the importance of patience.
46	17884	7	3	I have lived in a lot of different places throughout my life. They are @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS2. That's @CAPS3 different places. @CAPS6 was and still is land to about to @CAPS6 @CAPS4 somewhere along that long road in @LOCATION2 my parents got divorced. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually @PERSON2. We moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom, my sister, and me. @CAPS6 was fun there because @CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandma for about six years. @CAPS4 I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months. My grandma told me to stop moving and said I would see him soon. By soon @CAPS6 didn't think she meant @NUM2 months. In those @NUM2 months we wanted a house neat to a patch of woods and a fresh water @DATE1. My mom even got a boyfriend that she later broke up with. Then later she started and still is dating the guy we are renting our house from. When my dad called and said that he was coming, @CAPS6 made me so happy. @CAPS6 @CAPS7 didn't think that @CAPS6 could make @CAPS6 @NUM4 months without seeing my dad. @CAPS4 @CAPS6 did @CAPS6. Now that he's settled in I see him once a month for one weekend. Which is better than @NUM4 months or not at all.
47	17885	7	3	I was patient on the trip to @LOCATION1; it took two days to get down there. I got hungry and had to go to the bathroom often. Whenever I was hungry I had to wait until the next stop when we got gas, so when the tank was full I had to be patient without complaining. I had to be patient until the gas tank was empty; that’s when we got gas and I could eat something. Or I had to be patient until there was a @CAPS1 on the right hand side or a rest area because they have a vending machine there and bathrooms there too. It had to be on the right hand side so we could get off and then get back on the highway easily. That’s when I really had to practice my patience.
48	17886	7	3	When I was patient, I was patient once or twice. One time was when I had to use the phone but my mom was on it for a long time. So I waited an hour and a half to use the phone, trying not to bother her. Another time was when I wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 to get some pop. So I was patient while my mom got everybody else ready to go to @ORGANIZATION1, which felt like it took forever. In both situations, waiting quietly was the only thing to do.
49	17887	7	3	"It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one but I don’t remember a lot from that. I was super excited! So, I’m sorry if I couldn’t help but wonder @CAPS1 the ? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there feeling very bored. I kept saying, ""When are you going to be done?"" or, ""When are we leaving?"" Every time I asked, I got the same reply: ""Just be patient, honey."" So, I tried, but it wasn’t really working. We finally left, and it was an hour drive; when you're seven, that’s a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said, ""Daddy, when are we gonna be there?"" I got, ""Later, just be patient."" So I followed his demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsuit on, I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pants. I was going to go knock on the bathroom door but, I didn’t; I took what I had learnt earlier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient, things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today, but every once in a while everyone is a little impatient."
50	17888	7	3	A time when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to allow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parents were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient again. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bringing the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and overjoyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. We all fell in love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!
51	17889	7	3	You have to be patient when you are cooking some cookies. It takes a long time to cook cookies properly, as you must wait for them to turn golden brown. You have to be patient when you are waiting to play a game, especially if there is a long line. And you have to be patient in the waiting room until they finally call your name. You have to be patient when you get out in a game; you have to be patient to get back in. When you get a home run you have to be patient when they try to get the ball back from the field. For example, in the game of Sorry you have to be patient to get the specific card you need, like a one or a two. If you get a one then you can get your piece out of the start. If you get a two then you get out and get another turn, which makes the waiting worthwhile.
52	17890	7	3	My sister is very patient, unlike my brothers and me. Well, my siblings and I had our progress reports coming, and I was so excited to see what I got. My brothers were also anxious, and we would always bother our mom, asking when are they coming and did you see them yet. But my sister was always calm and patient, never seeming worried at all. Then the day they finally arrived we all got nervous, except for her. The reason why she is so patient is because she tries to keep it off her mind by sleeping or reading a book. But back to the report cards, we opened them and then everyone was happy, even my mom because we all got good grades. Then after that my brothers and me learned a valuable lesson from my sister, and now we all try to have more patience in our lives.
53	17891	7	3	It had been about one week after I got my iPod touch, and I really wanted to get this certain movie. The movie was I Am Legend. I had already seen it once on my cousin's iPod, but it was so cool that I had to watch it again. It had so much action in it, with thrilling scenes and suspense. And there were zombie-like creatures that attack the main character. The special effects were impressive, making the whole experience very engaging. I was determined to find and download it for my own device to enjoy the story whenever I wanted.
54	17892	7	3	"I know I can, I said to myself as I was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. I bent backwards, tried kicking over, and fell! Errg! I stood back up and asked my coach, ""Are my shoulders right?"" She said to align my shoulders for the kick over. ""Okay, I got it,"" I said. As I bent backwards again I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom's face could never be replaced; she was so proud of me. Then my mom ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said, ""thank you for being so patient."" My mom said, ""Anything for you, baby."""
55	17893	7	3	Two years ago on my birthday the only thing I wanted was an iPod touch. Well, everybody got to the party, we ate cake and ice cream, and then I opened presents. I got many nice gifts, but none was the iPod touch. I was sad, but then I opened birthday cards and I got some money. I told my mom since I didn’t get the iPod, I could go buy it myself. But I had to wait till everybody was gone to go get it, which felt like forever. After a few hours of being patient, I finally went to the store with my mom and got it, making my birthday wish come true.
56	17894	7	3	A time I was patient is when my little brother kept messing with me. He kept doing dumb stuff like pulling the curtains down or playing with the stove, which was both annoying and dangerous. I felt a surge of anger and frustration, and I really wanted to hit him to make him stop. But I took a deep breath and didn't hit him because I understood he was just being a kid and didn't know any better. I calmly told him to stop and explained why his actions were wrong, which was a much better way to handle the situation.
57	17896	7	3	I have been patient lots of times at the clinic. My sister, my brother, and my mom and dad, we all had to wait on the clinic to get all of the shots ready for my brother, my sister, and me. It took forever, about two hours, for the clinic to get the shots ready to be used. One time me and my dad had to wait an hour to two hours so that I could sign up for football. We had to wait to get weighed, get the right size helmet and pads, and we also had to wait for my pad pants and my mouth guard. My dad and I one time had to wait a long time in Dunn's because my mom bought my dad a new gun. My dad had to set the gun and put it in his name. For basketball sign up when I lived in Pleasant, it took a long time to sign up for basketball because we had to get my number put on the right size of shirt for me and my last name; I also had to get basketball shorts in my size. When I played soccer for the youth soccer team, it took one hour because there were so many kids that wanted to play soccer like me and my friends. When my mom took me to the sign-ups last year, it took almost three hours to sign up and get pictures taken. Every school day my friends and I wait like twenty or thirty minutes to get a lunch or a snack like rice crispy rolls, zebra cakes, or granola bars. It takes a long time before we can go outside to play football, soccer, volleyball, and kick ball. All of these experiences have taught me the value of waiting calmly.
58	17897	7	3	"I was patient when my mom was giving birth to my baby brother. We had to sit in the waiting room, my sister and I, for four long hours. I slept a couple of times and ate a lot because my dad was hungry so he got us some food also. The first hour I was excited and couldn't wait, full of anticipation. The second hour I was coloring with the crayons and paper the nurse brought to us. The third hour I watched tv to pass the time. The fourth hour I slept till about one o'clock, that's what my sister told me later. My dad came out with a plastic looking dress on with the matching head shower cover and slippers, and he said the next time he comes out my sister and I were gonna be sisters to a baby boy. My sister and I were so happy to hear that. So an hour later my dad came out and said, ""Do you want to see the baby?"" My sister and I screamed, ""Yes!"" When we saw him we were so happy to think he was all ours, and the long wait felt completely worth it."
59	17898	7	3	If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patience or motivation? In this situation I would ask for patience. I remember when I was about four or five years old. My two sisters and I boarded a plane to Florida. It seemed like we were sitting on the plane for hours before it actually took off. After about ten minutes in the air, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all the people just sitting there; some were on laptops and listening to music players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient and calm. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing, feeling restless. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours, and then I eventually fell asleep from the boredom. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patience or motivation? I am still not very patient, but I am more patient than I was back then, which shows I have learned a little.
60	17899	7	3	"""Dad! Look out!"" my sister squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deafening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. The eerie silence that followed frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to what they considered safety. In no way was this to be considered safety, for this was the beginning of one living nightmare, the living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of what I saw: three cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother. His chest expanded slowly, but as it did, excruciating sounds radiated from him. Blood trickled out from his many cuts. It was unbearable to watch. Ambulances’ sirens wailed as they approached. My father I have yet to see. And that’s what scared me most. I still have nightmares of that night, the night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in some ways, I’d lost my mother as well. She’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a dad and little brother. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constantly, never listening to what the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her mother. I wouldn’t know because in no way were we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who-knows-what, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart-pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. She begins to try and understand my strange ways. ""Honey,"" she starts, ""I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing."" I give her a questioning gaze, so she continues, ""I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?"" She didn’t have to explain any farther. ""Mom, I made Dad turn around,"" my voice caught in my throat, ""just to get my stupid notebook."" A single tear weaved its way down my face. ""Oh, honey!"" my mother teared up as well. ""That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!"" I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. She was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out, and I was to win that fight. ""Mom,"" I said, regaining composure, ""that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe over time I will, but right now, I just need my mom."" What shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. ""I will wait then."" And then she hugged me. She hugged me as she had when I was four and broke my leg, tight and unhesitatingly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother, maybe not as strong as it had been, but definitely there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect each other once more."
61	17900	7	3	"There was one time I was patient when my little brother's PlayStation wasn't working, so it took a while to get used to the situation. It was an evening, and my little brother had just finished eating. He wanted to play his video games, but he was having a hard time turning on the console. The problem was that some of his games were scratched up, which prevented them from loading properly. But the next day we bought him a lot of other games that were brand new, hoping this would solve the issue. So as he tried the new games he still couldn't get it to work. So then he asked me if I could help him, and I agreed to help him, but it still didn't work. I checked the console and cleared up the PlayStation, wiping off any dust. Then we had to wait patiently for it to reset, and finally, after a few tense moments, it powered on. My little brother and I kept saying, ""work, work, work, work,"" until it went on. Then to this day we still say that phrase for the PlayStation to work, as a little ritual for good luck."
62	17901	7	3	I learned about patience when I had to babysit my younger cousin. I rocked him gently and played with him to keep him happy. I fed him his bottle, and I walked him around the room when he became fussy. Eventually, he fell asleep in my arms. My mom still was not home from work, and I was growing anxious. I was going to be late to the movies with my cousins, who were already waiting. To pass the time, I played a game on my phone. I looked out the window repeatedly, then I walked outside and sat on the front steps, hoping to see her car. My mom still was not there. My cousins were outside too, and they asked me if I could stay a little longer until my mom arrived. Just then, here came mom driving up the street. I felt a wave of relief, and I could go now to join my cousins for the movie.
63	17902	7	3	There are many times when I've been patient, but here are just a few examples. It was a late afternoon, and my family and I were supposed to go to a big function that day. Like always, I didn't know what I was going to wear. After searching through my closet for about an hour, I finally found an outfit. I went down stairs soon after, only to discover no one else was ready and we only had about an hour left before we needed to leave. I was frustrated and told everyone to go get ready, but nobody listened to me. But I didn't care at that point, so I went up to take a shower. Right when I was about to go in, my mom came and told me I had to wait because she was going to take a shower first. Then one by one, everyone else took a shower except for me. I was losing my patience, feeling my irritation grow. I still waited quietly because I didn't want to start a commotion or an argument. Finally, it was my turn and I went in to take a shower. We were all dressed and ready to go, or so I thought. At the last minute, when we all got in the car, my sister forgot her bag and jacket so we had to wait till she ran back inside to get it. We finally made it to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, a few examples of me showing patience is when I waited to take a shower and when I waited for my sister to get her bag and jacket.
64	17903	7	3	The time I was most patient was when I was waiting on my mom to have her baby. The reason why is because she was being a pain to me during that period. She was mean and irritable about every little thing. So I was like, oh my goodness, she needs to have this baby so all this can be over and done with. This was when she was only seven months pregnant, so I knew that I had to be so patient with her until the nine months were completely over. I understood it was a difficult time for her, which helped me manage my feelings and remain calm throughout the rest of her pregnancy.
65	17904	7	3	One day, Sarah was at a baseball conference, where her coach was giving a speech about signing up for the trophy baseball league correctly, which sparked a lot of questions and other discussions. Her friend Mark walked out of the room because he didn't have the patience to sit through the long presentation. So when he came into the room again, the sign-up sheet had already been passed around. After the conference ended, Mark had to talk to some people and sign up separately, but he had to sit through a longer lecture from his dad about his lack of patience. When it finally came to playing baseball, Mark quit because he was a poor sport. He was placed at the bottom of the batting lineup and he only played in the outfield. During a game, when a batter hit a homerun over his head, he dropped his mitt on the field in frustration and simply walked off, ending his brief time with the team.
66	17905	7	3	I was patience when I wanted my thought and I had to wait until my birthday to get it, which felt like a very long time. I was also patience to get my new phone, but I had to be good at school and that was hard for me because I use to always be bad and stuff like that. I use to want everything right away, but I use to have to be patience and I use to always be good to get it, learning that rewards come to those who wait and behave properly. This taught me a valuable lesson about self-control and the importance of earning what you desire through consistent effort and good behavior.
67	17906	7	3	“Patient!” my mom yelled as I was almost bouncing off the walls waiting for my friend to get to my house. “I get it, I just can't wait! It's my first time, what do you expect!” I told my mom. DING DONG! The doorbell rang and I sprinted to the door. “Hey!” “Hi!” my friend exclaimed. “Now you guys need to go wait in the garage for your dad,” Mom said. “Okay!” we said in harmony. We ran out the door and it was pitch dark. “I can't see, hold me!” I screamed in terror. All we saw was headlights and we knew it was my dad. “Are you guys ready? It's almost time and we gotta leave or we won't make it to the concert!” my dad was excited. Just hearing that word, concert, was the key to getting there; the whole thing was great but at the concert you gotta have a lot of patience to enjoy the show and wait for your favorite songs.
68	17908	7	3	One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one. I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree. I was lucky I had a camouflage shirt on, because if I didn’t blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldn’t have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you, by allowing you to wait for the perfect moment to strike and achieve victory.
69	17909	7	3	I was patient a few years ago with my brother. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television; the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birthday or not. He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying. I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didn’t work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly, and my patience was rewarded with seeing his joy and having a fun afternoon together.
70	17910	7	3	One night when I got home from cheer I was starving, and the dinner wasn’t even on the grill. We were having steak, brown rice, and mac and cheese. To pass time I went upstairs to take a shower; I took ten minutes to take a shower and it still wasn’t ready. So I did some homework. I did math, reading, and I studied for a test. The mac and cheese was ready, the steak was almost ready and the brown rice wasn’t even close to being ready. I was so hungry and tired, but I kept my patient. Oh my gosh the food smelt so yummy. I wanted to eat right then. I was so hungry that I had to put gum into my mouth to keep my mouth busy. Two minutes later the steak was ready, mac and cheese was ready but we are still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and poured our drinks; I still had my patient. Five minutes later the food was ready. All four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate. Oh my gosh it was so yummy. I had two little pieces of steak, three scoops of rice—I love rice—and a tiny piece of mac and cheese. The dinner was awesome. After that dinner I went straight up to bed, full and happy that my patience had paid off with such a delicious meal.
71	17911	7	3	"One time I was very patient. We were on a train going to @LOCATION1. I didn't have my game or music player. It felt like the journey would never end, @CAPS2 I didn't complain. I just sat in the seat for what felt like forever, watching the scenery pass by. Then when we finally got off the train I said, ""@CAPS1. I'm done."" @CAPS2 then there was the long bus ride to the Museum of Science and History. Not as interesting, I thought to myself. Once again, stop after stop we went, the bus lurching along. Until finally we got there. It was amazing; there were tons of interesting things like exhibits that made tops or @CAPS3. @CAPS2 then patience was tested again when we went to the history section. It was the train all over again. Dad had to see everything and anything, reading every plaque. Then we had to take the bus back to the train station. Next came the train ride again. @CAPS2 this time I had a top, but even that got boring after a while, so I still didn't complain. @CAPS2 dad said it had been a long day and I would be able to bring my own entertainment next time. That is my example of patience."
72	17912	7	3	"I want to say I found her, the right away but I didn’t. I learned something though; yeah, it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it together. But love is, love is patient; if you run to it, it probably won’t stay with you, but if you wait and are patient, maybe, just maybe it’ll come to you. I just have to make sure I’m somewhere she can find me,"" said Church. @NUM1 year later. ""@CAPS3, what’s thhhiiis?"" @CAPS4 said, ""I know what this is. Can I just shut the door for the night?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6, Patience, @PERSON1, we're waiting for @CAPS7,"" @CAPS8 replied. ""@CAPS3, here he comes now,"" @CAPS10, @CAPS10. @CAPS11, what I found in Church. ""@CAPS6,"" @CAPS4, ""you found the @CAPS1. Capture him, wait, he’s in."" ""Do you think we have to wait for it to unlock?"" ""When will it do that unlocky openy thing?"" ""I don’t know; we will have to wait and see. That is, if it will open at all."""
73	17913	7	3	One time my friend @PERSON1 was at my house and we were playing Halo. We were having a very good time, laughing and competing. We ate popcorn, drank a lot of pop, and ate a lot of candy. Then @PERSON1 had to go to the bathroom. He was there for a while, and suddenly I had to go to the bathroom very badly. I waited and waited, feeling the pressure build. I was very polite and patient because I never yelled at him or knocked on the door telling him to hurry up. I did ask him once if he was okay, and he said yes; after that, I just waited quietly. Then he finally came out and @CAPS1 a very big relief for me.
74	17914	7	3	"Patience, what do you think when you hear that word? When I was little, I always thought it would be simply impossible to have a thing like that, but after I badly hurt my ankle and was put in a cast and on crutches for four long months, I really got the hang of it. My mom would always say, ""patience is a virtue."" Have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience? Well, it's really just the ability to control yourself. You have to be able to get through tough situations and still be in control, and you really have to control yourself when people annoy you or when things take a while to happen. It is a skill that is learned through experience."
75	17915	7	3	At the doctor, there were a lot of people, so we decided to stay and wait. Also, my mom and my dad went with me and my sister to the doctor. Furthermore, my sister and I wanted to go outside and play, but my parents said no, so we watched television instead. My mom was reading a magazine, and my dad was reading a newspaper to pass the time. Finally, there were only a little few people left, so after the person before us went in, the doctor called out my name and my sister's. My dad and mom went with us so my sister wouldn't get scared. They just did check-ups, and after that, my dad paid and we left for home. That is how we were being patient that day.
76	17916	7	3	One day I had to wait in a long, slow-moving line for @NUM1 hours just to get on a roller coaster called @CAPS1. It was very hot and I was not very patient, so I just fell asleep while standing with my eyes open. My mom had to have patience later when we were stuck in heavy traffic trying to get to the camping grounds. We had to wait another @NUM2 hours just to get out of the traffic jam, but mom didn't freak out or anything, showing great calm. It was a long day that truly tested our ability to wait quietly.
77	17917	7	3	One time this year, I saw a guy who was at the front of the lunch line and he was just about to go in, but he had to go to the end because he wasn't all the way in the line. As he got sent to the back, he initially got mad, but he went patiently and did not cause any advice. Then, the next thing he knew, he was back at the front of the line. I think that being patience means when you are calm and you don't rush things, and the next thing you know, you would be the next one to succeed.
78	17918	7	3	Patience is about waiting for something for a long time without getting upset. If you have patience, that is good for you, and here is a time where I had to use it. Last year in @DATE1, after school, my dad and I went hunting for deer in the woods of @CAPS1. He went to this homemade blind that we found and we sat in a chair waiting for a deer to come along. You have to have a lot of patience while going hunting. We didn’t see anything for a while, but then a deer came along and my dad got ready. He said, “cover your ears,” then he shot, but we didn’t see any sign of deer blood so he must have missed. Then we packed up our gear and went home. That is the time I had patience to go hunting with my dad, but we didn’t get anything though, which was a little disappointing.
79	17919	7	3	A time that I was patient is when I broke my foot. It was a @DATE1 when I was at the park playing. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I slipped and slid down. My little brother came running over there and I told him to go and get help. He had no idea where to go, so I lied on the ground with a broken foot for over @NUM1 hour. When my brother returned he asked, “where do I go?” And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone. I was trying to be patient when he got back, and he had my mom with him. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed with people. They got us in as soon as they could but it felt like a long time to me. When they called my name, my mom picked me up and she went toward the doctor. He asked, “what brings you here?” we told him the news and he took us into the room. The doctor moved my foot around gently. Ten minutes later he came back in with the x-rays and announced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crutches and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him a really big hug. The next day everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient and I said thank you, feeling grateful for my brother's help.
80	17920	7	3	"One time I was patient when I was in @LOCATION1 getting on a ride called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2."" My @CAPS3 parents were with me. @CAPS4 was a @CAPS5, long line and I'm usually saying ""@CAPS6 on!"" Or sometimes ""@CAPS7's go!"" because I get impatient. @CAPS8, this time I was being @CAPS5 patient in the line, waiting quietly without complaint. I was proud of my self and so was my mom for my calm behavior. That was the time I was being patient and it felt like a real accomplishment."
81	17921	7	3	Tick tock times ticking. I was patient one time it was in the doctor's office; my appointment was at two and I had to wait and wait and wait and wait. I sat there in the stiff, uncomfortable chair until it was nearly four o'clock and they finally called me in. Once again I had to wait and wait again in the small, sterile examination room. So I was trying so hard to be patient and trust me it is not easy for me at least because I can’t even sit there for five minutes and stay still I have to move around so it was hard to sit there listening to the relentless sound tik tok for a while. And that was the time I was patient; it was hard to believe but I did it. The hardest part was when you hear one of those ticker clocks go tik tok and I was sitting there for a while now you absolutely know that for some people including me. It is sometimes hard for you to be patient some times its ok to be patient and sometimes its so hard to be patient and sit there and do absolutely nothing, so that is my story about the time I was patient and was not impatient sitting there doing nothing, not complaining, waiting to read some old magazines.
82	17922	7	3	One time when I was patient was when there was a twenty-two hour car ride to Florida. It was me, my cousin, my two sisters, and my parents all crammed into the family minivan. It was very boring. I was sitting in the back with my sister, and we kept fighting for foot space. Around five hours in, I was feeling cramped and my legs were getting stiff. We stopped off for dinner at a roadside diner, then were on the road again. When it started to become night, the road froze over and we stopped off at a rest area and slept in the car, which was cold and uncomfortable. We woke up during sunrise, stiff and tired, and went to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. It was delicious, with warm pancakes and syrup. Then we got back into the car and drove the rest of the way to Florida. It must have been a long drive, but it was worth it when we finally saw the ocean.
83	17923	7	3	Some people say that if somebody’s trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but that’s not always true. One day my brother was downloading new ringtones, which I thought was no big deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone. The mosquito tone is a loud, high-pitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It’s really funny if you are the one playing it but if you are listening to it, it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea, the kind only a jerk could have; he decides he’s going to follow me around the house playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curdle. After thirty minutes of this torment I decided to call my mom, but it didn’t really help as she just told him to stop, which he ignored. Then I listened to music on my headphones, so he turned his phone's volume up even higher. Then I had this amazing idea; I waited for him to put his phone down and then I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that awful ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of course he said yes so I didn’t have to hear the tone anymore. So now you know from my experience why patience doesn’t always work with a determined pest.
84	17924	7	3	"I was patient for a whole month. Although, that was only because my mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the Wii, for it had just come out and had me interested the first time I saw it. It was completely different and had advanced graphics. I had informed my mother about this system immediately. ""Mom, I will buy it for you, considering your report card was exceptional,"" my mother had guaranteed me. ""Great! Thank you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting my hopes up and expecting it within two weeks. Although I had done that only to later on disappoint myself. My mother had informed us that I was to get it in between the time period of one to three months. ""Three months?"" I had shouted. ""Three months? I don't have enough time to think about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" my mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in my entire life. After approximately one and a half months of waiting, my mother had finally said, ""We are going to the store today to buy your Wii"". At that very moment, my head nearly exploded from happiness. ""Yes!"" I shouted, and I had started to do a dance that no one understood, not even me. So when we pulled up to my favorite video game retail store, I was so excited I couldn't sit still. ""Settle down! Geez, it's just a video game system!"" I stopped immediately. ""That's what you think,"" I mumbled to myself. When we had returned home, I had kept playing until late in the evening. So that is when I learned that patience pays off when you're patient."
85	17926	7	3	Patience is hard for me because I have almost no patience for anything! So you can imagine how hard it was for me and anyone else who has no patience waiting in lines at Disneyland. First of all the drive—it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I was; I didn't complain at all. When we got to Disneyland the first day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up to two hours long! Well I didn't complain, but it was hard not to! My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for, but I held my patience, not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting I felt like I was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was at this seafood restaurant which was bad anyway because I hate seafood! While all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the Disney buses to get back to your hotel; the crowds were huge and it was late. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me for keeping my patience through all of the waiting. I learned a lot of things there. One, Disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second, patience is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience. So, that's one time I had to have a lot of patience, but I realized patience is a good thing to have.
86	17927	7	3	Tick and tock went the second hand of my watch and I went on, waiting for the flight that seemed so far away. It was a wait where people came in and out of the airport with presents and boxes, giving out tree-shaped candy. The gate queues didn’t fill up a lot, but there were still lot and lot of people. On a seat by the airplane window, I went to the window and listened to the ride, the noise like a loud automobile engine close by. And the most frustrating thing that happened was I let my bag get left behind. At the destination it was found safely. I went back to the airport and then I went home. In that circumstance I was patient. In that entire situation I was patient in the terminal and at the airport and never lost my composure, and that is what patience is all about, learning to endure the wait calmly.
87	17928	7	3	One day I went to a concert at the stadium and there was a very long line. While I was in the line there was this girl who had no patience because we had to wait in line for one and a half hours. When that time past we all went to get our spots and before we had did that there was this long line again but even longer, but it was ok cause I had patience. With all this patience it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctors office for three hours and I had to wait in his waiting room, just sitting there quietly. And also I went to my living room with my mom and she just started talking on the phone and she told me to hold on but my sister kept on interrupting her and I told her you need to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone. So she ran up the stair and she said your stupid punk so I said I don’t care, and I just waited for my mom to finish her call.
88	17930	7	3	I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for me so he said he would get it for me on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didn’t keep my mouth shut so my mom didn’t want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be Saturday he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That’s exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot of patience to get my reward, but in the end, it was worth the wait.
89	17931	7	3	Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know that being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from them, it's just not pretty. But one time I really had to use my patience. Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at Kings Island for two hours just to go on the roller coaster. We waited about another thirty minutes maybe forty-five minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left which was nicer because our line shortened some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warming up and waiting, debating on whether or not we wanted to stay or leave. We ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever until we stepped into the space shuttle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally, the wait was over! Using my patience and waiting in line forever really paid off in the end. It was a great ride and I was glad I had waited.
90	17932	7	3	"""Coach, this is boring! I want to try my backflip!"" I whined. ""No, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be easier,"" said Coach, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hand-spring. We had been working on our back-hand-springs for weeks and I was the best at them in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at Coach's answer, and continued to practice my back-hand-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called Coach so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and Coach was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. ""Ouch!"" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! Coach ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. ""What happened?"" ""I tried my back flip."" ""I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!"" ""I know…"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" Ever since that day, I have had problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be in gymnastics. From then on, I've known that being patient is the right thing to do."
91	17933	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to the doctor's office for a check-up. Me and my dad had to wait in the lobby for a long time, after every other person went in for their appointments. I couldn’t take it no more, but he made me stay and be quiet. So I kept quiet, even though most of the time I really wanted to say something really bad but instead I held it all in. I just sat there, looking at the old magazines and listening to the clock tick. So finally we went in and I was so happy. It was like I was the happiest man on earth, finally getting to see the doctor after all that waiting. That’s my story about patience.
92	17935	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shopping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shopping; it was boring but it was kind of full because some of the clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the other. One store only had girl clothes which I hated, so I just followed them around quietly. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient. Later, my mom asked me where do you want to go? I said to Best Buy, and I got a game; it was College Football. When you have patience it can pay off in the end, and you should always have patience where ever you go or are, always have patience.
93	17936	7	3	I am patient; I always have to wait for something or earn it. I go to my grouping with my parents but I have to wait my turn. I have to wait to go to my aunt's house, which sometimes feels like it takes forever. The worst time to wait is going to the water park up north and camping, because the car ride is so long and you just want to get there and start having fun. But I have learned that waiting is just a part of life, and you have to get through it.
94	17937	7	3	One time I was patient for the doctors and I had a great time because the wait was worth it. Another time I was patient, I was at the dentist, sitting still in the big chair. My third time I was patient was when I was going to the science museum and it was boring waiting in line but I was patient and didn't complain. Last but not least I was patient to go on the Tower of Terror. It was the funnest ride there, and being patient in that long, winding line made the final ride even more exciting and rewarding.
95	17938	7	3	"Patience is important in life. Sometimes when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing, so here are some examples of when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example, if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble, but if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say ""my gosh this is taking forever"" and then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience; for an example, if you didn't, you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line. You would probably say ""forget it"" and then go home, so if you went home you would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another example of if you didn’t have patience. For example, say you wanted to go the mall and buy a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash register didn’t work so they had to call maintenance to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said ""forget it"" and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some examples of people who didn’t have patience, but if they did, that wouldn’t have happened to them because they would have waited for what they needed. Having patience is a good thing, but not having it is not a good thing at all."
96	17939	7	3	I sat there, staring off into the distance waiting for something to happen. I casually leaned back in my chair and propped my head toward the ceiling, closing my eyes. I tried my best to clear my head and be patient, focusing on my breathing. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some metal bars in line for clear paint’s @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and a hint of danger. The line was estimated at a two hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I were determined to ride the ride. We started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us with its relentless heat. “@CAPS1 is this taking so long?!” I said impatiently, shifting my weight from one foot to the other. “@CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?” “@CAPS3,” I replied firmly. I fought with myself to be patient for the ride, knowing it would be worth it. The line slowly scooted forth in tiny increments. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead and trickled down my temple. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player, put in the earbuds, and thought of my favorite songs. I became more willing to wait, lost in the rhythm. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward as the line advanced. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player into my pocket and hurried ahead. But the line had moved a tremendous amount, and we were finally near the front. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on. I was proud of myself for being patient. We looked at the ride with excitement and hopped into the waiting car. Patience really pays off, and I learned to be patient with all sorts of things in life.
97	17940	7	3	I am always patient when I hunt and fish. I always go hunting, find a good spot, and settle or climb up into a tree stand. I wait for a long time for deer and turkey and @CAPS1, staying perfectly still and quiet. Some times you don’t see anything at all for hours, just the rustling leaves and the morning chill. The key is to get out early before the sun rises and to be patient, letting the woods wake up around you. Most of the time I usually see @NUM1 deer when it's deer season and I go out, sometimes a whole group passing by. How I see them a lot is by being patient a lot, letting the animals come to me on their own time, and that is the most important lesson for any hunter.
98	17941	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to come in the mail. They said it would only take @NUM1 days, so I said, “ok that’s not too bad,” and the days flew by. The day the hats were supposed to come in the mail, I was so excited. When the mail truck came by, I ran to the door, but there was only a box for my mom. “@CAPS1,” I said, disappointed. I was really trying to be patient, but I thought to myself they will come tomorrow. And they didn’t come, so I was still patient but close to not being so. Two more days passed, and I just gave up checking the mail. Then one day, when I got home from my friend's house, they were there on the kitchen table. Yes, finally! All my patience had paid off, and that’s the time I truly learned the value of having patience.
99	17942	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my favorite @ORGANIZATION1 of the year comes, the @ORGANIZATION1. I had waited patiently all year, counting down the days till @DATE1, reading books, and finishing homework that was almost done for another year. You could smell the tension in the air as everyone watched the clock spin on the last @ORGANIZATION1 of school, the final hours dragging on. As the hours went by, @ORGANIZATION1, seconds, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, every one grew restless, fidgeting at their desks, but I was patient; I sat calmly, I waited, I listened to the teacher, I read my book, but nothing compared to that final moment where the bell rang and the students cheered with joy. A smile was on everyone’s faces as they left the door for the final time that year, ready for the freedom of summer.
100	17943	7	3	Okay, I think I’ll start, oh yeah this is the good one. Once, no, one day, no, okay, some years, some time back, I had to be patient for my phone, and it was my first phone so I had to be good. It was a brand new phone; it had just come out and I had to have it. I needed to do a lot of chores around the house and get good grades at school, so my mom said I could get it next week, and I was determined to get it. So the next week, @NUM1, I was so happy, but she said, “next week, @DATE1.” I was just doing what I was supposed to be doing, my chores and homework. On that @DATE1, I was so happy I almost got in trouble from the excitement, but I still got paid for doing my house work. I didn't have enough at first, so I did some extra work helping the next door people and got some more money, and finally got the phone. It did take a long time, but that effort made it special. That is my story about learning patience.
101	17944	7	3	"One day Alex was bothering me, so I decided to be patient. But he kept on, and on, and on, making noises and interrupting my concentration. So I decided to tell him firmly to shut up. Again, he didn't listen to me, so I told @PERSON2. Alex did not stop yet, so I said nothing more and was going to try to be patient with the @CAPS1, who talks a lot, and with @PERSON1. Eventually, that approach did work, and Alex finally stopped, which made me feel happy. But then he started again with the disruptive behavior, so I told him to stop or I would tell the teacher again. He just shrugged his shoulders and kept right on doing all of his stupid noises. So I followed through and told the teachers, who said, ""Alex, you better stop this instance."" So Alex finally stopped and began scribbling with his pencil all over his piece of paper, finally leaving me in peace."
102	17945	7	3	A @DATE2 ago, my @CAPS1 was brought into the @ORGANIZATION1 because her incision from a previous operation had split open. Because of this @DATE2 physical roller coaster, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her and helping with her care. Now I'm back at school and trying hard to catch up with all my classes. So far I've successfully achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but I have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although the school policy states that students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me, willingly holding off on grading my assignments until I have the time to catch up in their class. I am working diligently, and I think I'll make it through this challenging period.
103	17946	7	3	I am writing about a time when I was patient. I, myself, @CAPS1, am not typically a patient person. One particular time, I had no choice but to be patient because my mother firmly made me. We were waiting for the bus to come, but I was very angry and frustrated because it seemed like it took forever to arrive. I kept fidgeting and complaining about the long wait. So my mother said, “@CAPS2, stop complaining and be patient, @CAPS1, I am serious!” I reluctantly sat down on the curb, and as soon as I did, the bus came around the corner, proving her point entirely.
104	17947	7	3	“@CAPS1 @CAPS8! Really?” It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at @LOCATION1 Pritz. The forecast was @CAPS8, @CAPS8 and @CAPS1 @CAPS8. The Tigers were playing the “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.” @PERSON1 was pitching for the @CAPS4 and Justin @CAPS6 for the Tigers. My dad, my mom, my brother, and I were just two rows from the front row. It was the bottom of the first inning, and I felt a huge drop of @CAPS8 touch my head. Then I felt another, and then another. “@CAPS7 upstairs for shelter!” my dad yelled. As soon as we got up in the shelter area, a complete downpour started. The players went into the dugouts. My mom called my grandpa to see what the forecast was. “@CAPS8,” @CAPS9 said. My mom took her sweatshirt off and gave it to me and my brother and said, “It's gonna be a long @TIME1, so rest up now.” At first, I didn't understand, but after she explained we would be waiting a while, I knew it was indeed gonna be long. At the time of this, I was only @NUM1 or @NUM2, so waiting is not really my thing. An hour passed by; it was still raining. @NUM3 hours, then @NUM4, then finally four and a half hours passed by. It was @NUM6 at @TIME1! The game still wasn't starting. My mom called my grandpa again. @CAPS9 said we still have another good hour of @CAPS8 left. We sat there forever! Me and my family were so bored, but my mom said patience would pay off. @NUM7 and a half hours later, it cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us, and we were ready to watch a game at @NUM8 am! My dad bought all of us ice cream for being so patient. The game ended at @NUM9! We only stayed till @NUM4.00 though because of the long drive home. In the end, I got to see an awesome baseball game and get ice cream, and I truly learned that patience pays off.
105	17949	7	3	Patience is to be quiet in lines, to wait to do something or to go somewhere until it is your turn, and not to complain or get frustrated, like kicking the wall and going crazy about waiting for something. You wait to get a new video game, or you wait to get a ticket to go to the show to see a movie; these are ways you could be patient while doing different things in life. Like one day, I was waiting in a long line to get a popular game, but it took so long to get to the front. I stayed in line calmly and used patience, and eventually, I was able to purchase the game I wanted.
106	17950	7	3	Being patient is hard to do, @CAPS1 I do remember a time when I was patient. This was at @CITY1. Me and my group had to wait for everyone to get back to the bus. We were the first oneís to the bus so it took a while before they came. The sun was warm, and we just sat on the curb, watching people pass by without any fuss. @CAPS1 before they did I was as calm and patient as can be, simply observing the world around me until the rest of our group finally arrived.
107	17951	7	3	"One time I was patient is when I was going skating. And I was waiting for my mother to come pick me up from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I told my friends ""yu ll need a ride"" and I made a mistake and told my mother the wrong time period it was @NUM1 and I told my mom @NUM2 and had to wait a whole @NUM3 hour. I sat on the cold bench outside the rink, watching all my friends get picked up one by one. I just passed the time by looking at my phone and tying my skates again, staying calm even though I knew the long wait was my own fault."
108	17952	7	3	That is the time I was to be patient. Hope you enjoyed I am not a very patient person very rarely have I been patient. But, there is sometimes I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade my whole day was full of patience. That day I was getting picked up early. I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a good @ORGANIZATION1. When it was getting close to the end of the day the speaker in my classroom went ì@CAPS1î then the lady and I had been called for an early dismissal mission I had been waiting for the moment! After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too! Then we went to there house got ready and we were off to a day we had all been waiting for, and all the waiting throughout the day made the final event feel even more special and rewarding.
109	17953	7	3	"The time when I was patient was when we went to the mall to go get my customized hat. This is the only time when I was patient. I went to the store called lio's. I picked out my hat and everything. So I said I wanted saad on their he did everything then I asked how long he said @NUM1 mineuts. We went around the mall and went back to the store that took like @NUM2 to @NUM3 mineuts. So I asked the guy is it done he said ""not yet"" I was watching him doing another guys hat. So he stopped the other guys hat, I didn't wanna make a scene and yell at the guy so I'm waiting and waiting until he's finally done with the hat that took about an hour. I just stood there quietly, looking at other hats in the store to pass the time. So I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat & I was happy that I had managed to stay so calm."
110	17954	7	3	Come on I need some help. Sir please sit down. I will be writing about a time my @CAPS4 took a suit to a tailor for a conference. Can you please find my suit. Sir we are trying our best, we might have given it to someone else on accident. I need that suit to go to my conference. Well sir what we can do is have you pick out another suit and we will have the tailor start imediently on youír suit o.k. I like this one. What needs to be done asked the tailor pants are to be long. I will have it done in no time, @CAPS1 me about two and a half hours thats when my plane leave for @CAPS2. I will have it done in @NUM1 minutes. I will be back here in @NUM1 minutes for waiting I will even @CAPS3 in a free tie. I waited nervously, checking my watch often, but I remained seated and did not complain. At the end my @CAPS4 ended up with his suit and we made it to the conference on time.
111	17955	7	3	A time when someone I know was patient was when my mom heard that my aunt @PERSON1 was going to get married and @CAPS1 was helping plan it. @CAPS1 was patient because during the time of helping plan a wedding, @CAPS1 was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and was two months away from graduating from a @ORGANIZATION1 called @CAPS2’s @ORGANIZATION1, while also taking care of a seven-month-old baby boy with the help of my dad and myself. This was a very demanding period, as @CAPS1 was simultaneously trying to get her parents here from @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, which involved a lot of other paperwork and arrangements to do. After two months of planning a wedding, taking excellent care of a new eight-month baby boy, studying for her final tests, and helping her parents come here, she succeeded in graduating. Through all these challenges, @CAPS1 was able to patiently help plan a beautiful wedding on @DATE1. This is a time when someone I know was truly patient and managed everything with calm perseverance.
112	17957	7	3	This is my way of patience: patience is power. Without patience, where would you be in the time of waiting on your house to be built? You would probably be going crazy because you don’t want to be living in a trashy trailer, camper, or even a temporary house! What about if you're in a doctor’s office for @NUM1 hours! Yes, you're going to be agitated! But, see, if you have patience you're going to be able to wait calmly through these frustrating situations. Patience allows you to endure delays without becoming overly stressed or angry, turning a difficult wait into a manageable period. Patience is power, and it is a vital strength for navigating life's inevitable delays.
113	17959	7	3	Patience is very hard when you're waiting for something you want. It is very hard when you're waiting in a line that is very loud and slow, or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait only two or three days yet it feels like an eternity. If you're not a patient person that can't wait for the simplest thing that will only take a little while, then you're a very impatient person that can't wait peacefully. If you are an impatient person then you are often selfish, easily mad, and evidently not patient, as you prioritize your own immediate desires over the natural flow of time. Learning to wait calmly is therefore an important step toward becoming a more considerate and composed individual.
114	17961	7	3	When I was at the mall one time with @PERSON1 we went to a store and bought matching hats and skirts. Then we went to the Chinese food stand and there was a long line, so we waited for like a half an hour to get our food. We waited patiently and we finally got our food and we sat down at a table, which turned out to be the last available table. Then a family of four was looking for a seat and @CAPS1, we got up and gave them our table. Then we went to the movies and we waited in line and @PERSON1 was being impatient, so @CAPS1 we had him save our spot. Then I took @PERSON1 across the walkway and got @PERSON1 a smoothie. Now @PERSON1 was happy to pay, and @CAPS1 we walked back to the movie theater and we bought @NUM1 bags of popcorn, and then we patiently waited in line to get our seats. That is one of my stories of being patient with my friends and how it made the whole day more enjoyable for everyone.
115	17962	7	3	Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting requires what you will think of as a lot of patience. When you are sitting in a tree blind you @MONTH1 experience one of the most boring @NUM1 minutes of your life, which definitely requires a lot of patience and stillness. After you settle in and are being quiet, the woods come alive all around you with sounds and movement. I have to admit, I don’t have a lot of patience in most situations, but hunting requires a different kind of patience that is more focused. Hunting is something that many might think of as just sitting around doing nothing, a passive activity. But if you are patient enough and quiet, you are often rewarded with a sighting of whatever you are hunting. This is one thing that I definitely think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would think of; it’s an entertaining and active patience that brings its own quiet rewards. That is why I think everyone should be more patient, as it can open up new and rewarding experiences.
116	17963	7	3	"Once upon a time there was a preteen named Lola @CAPS1 who lived in a land called Wonderland. Lola was a single queen @CAPS1 who had lots of money and food and @CAPS1 owned a big house, but there was one thing that Lola was missing: @CAPS3 was a preteen prince. There were lots of boys throwing themselves at her, but not one of the cute, strong preteen boys was the one for her. So one day, @CAPS1 decided to go to the village to see all her people, and they were very happy to see her, yelling her name ""Lola! Lola!"" and telling her that she was the best queen they had ever had. Then, after they stopped yelling her name, @CAPS1 saw a cute and strong preteen prince whose name was @PERSON2, and @CAPS1 immediately fell in love. She went over to him and said hello, and he said @CAPS4. Then @CAPS1 asked, ""Do you want to come to my place and have dinner?"" and he said yes. ""Where do you live?"" he asked, and @CAPS1 said, ""In the big place,"" to which he replied, ""Okay, see you at six."" He did not know @CAPS1 was the queen, so he went to the big place and they ate crab legs. After dinner they played video games, and after that they started to like each other. Then a month later they were boyfriend and girlfriend, and everything was going well. @CAPS1 wanted him to ask her to marry her, but @CAPS1 knew she had to wait patiently, and so @CAPS1 did. @CAPS1 waited a year, and he still did not ask her to marry him. @CAPS1 knew that if @CAPS1 asked him, @CAPS3 would not work out, so @CAPS1 waited some more, and he still didn't ask her. So the next day, @CAPS1 went out with her friends @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, Feanne, and @CAPS5, and they went to the @CAPS6. They sat in the mud bath and were talking about how @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 were doing, and @LOCATION2 said they were doing good. ""@CAPS3 is just, he won't ask me to marry him,"" Lola confided. ""I don't think he wants to ask me, but we are living together."" The next day, @CAPS1 came home and all her friends and family were in her house. In front of everyone, he asked her to marry him and @CAPS1 said yes. Everyone was happy for her, and he said, ""I was going to ask you; I just wanted @CAPS3 to be one you will never forget."" @CAPS1 asked her friends if they knew, and they said, ""Yes, everyone knew; we just couldn't tell you."" A year later, they had a big wedding; @CAPS3 was so pretty, and @CAPS3 was the wedding of the village. Everyone was there and they partied all night. The @CAPS7 lived happily ever after, proving that good things come to those who wait."
117	17964	7	3	"There once was a soldier named @CAPS7 Connor. He was a Private First Class. His best friend, named @PERSON1, was also a Private. ""I can't believe we have to wait six months before we actually get to deploy,"" @CAPS1 @CAPS7 said with a sigh. ""@CAPS2 that's how it is, man,"" @CAPS1 @PERSON1 replied, trying to console him. They both @CAPS1 started walking to the firing range for their daily training. Ping! Went the target as a bullet struck it. ""@CAPS3 shot!"" @CAPS1 @PERSON1 exclaimed, impressed. ""@CAPS5,"" @CAPS6 @CAPS7 said modestly. Right in the center of the target was the hole where the bullet had struck. @CAPS7 had great aim, a natural marksman, but he still had to wait for his chance to serve abroad. ""Patience,"" @CAPS1 @PERSON1 reminded him. @CAPS7 was patient and all, but he wanted to go so badly, dreaming of the day he would finally see action. Finally, his time came for deployment. He was so excited to go, feeling that his long wait was over. One day on patrol, his convoy was hit hard by mortars, and he was killed in an instant. In this story, patience is the key to everything, a virtue that guides us through waiting, but it cannot always shield us from fate. Remember about patience the next time you have to wait, for it prepares the spirit even for the unexpected."
118	17965	7	3	In your own way, showing patience means you don't be rude; you just stand there and wait quietly until it is your turn. To me, patience means you stand or sit there quietly and with no rude comments, accepting the delay without complaint. For example, one time my mom's friend was patient while waiting for her as my mom exchanged my brother's helmet at the store. When I was in the store with my cousin, she was patient while picking out an outfit even though I was taking a long time to decide. Another time, when my brother and I were in the store, he was buying a pair of shoes and I was patient; I didn't get mad or make any rude comments while he tried them on. One time, me and my nephew were in a different store, and I was ordering some food at the counter. He made rude comments about the wait because he was impatient. The choice of patience is clear: you have to be patient and wait your turn to go, understanding that everyone's time will come. The whole purpose of this writing is to show that you have to be patient in life, as it leads to calmer and more respectful interactions with everyone around you.
119	17966	7	3	One time when my family went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, we had to wait in a very long line for the one roller coaster I had said I wanted to ride. Well, I wasn't as patient as my sister, who stood calmly, but I was pretty patient overall, fidgeting only a little. After the ride was over, I had completely forgotten how long it took to get to the front of the line; the thrill erased the wait from my mind. My parents remembered, though; they later said they thought we had left the park and driven off to somewhere else because it took so long. Well, there are many other times I have been patient, like the time my friend took two full days to put music on my @CAPS2. She had just gotten her own @CAPS2 touch and she was eager to put music on it, so she asked me if I wanted more music on my @CAPS2 as well. Well, I said yes, grateful for the offer. Even though I know I can't spend a day without using or just looking at my @CAPS2, I understood the favor took time. The only thing I could do was be patient and wait for her to finish. Okay, after two days she finally gave it back to me. I thanked her and then asked what had taken so long. She explained that the computer was taking forever to sync, and her internet was running slowly, so the files were on it like forever. In the end, my patience was rewarded with a full music library.
120	17967	7	3	"""@CAPS14, can I go over to @CAPS1's house after school today?"" asked @CAPS2. ""I’ll call and tell the school, okay?"" answered her @CAPS14. You are probably worried about who @CAPS1 is. @CAPS10, she is @CAPS2's best friend in the world; they have been friends since they were in diapers. Do you know how old they are now? @CAPS10, they are thirteen years old now. Now let's talk about @CAPS2 for a minute. @CAPS2 is from a family of five: her @CAPS14, her dad, her brother, and her @CAPS14 has a baby on the way. @CAPS2 is so excited for the new baby; she always wanted a little brother or a @CAPS16. At first, after school, @CAPS2 got the message saying that she could go to her friend's house. So @PERSON1 and she started to walk to @PERSON1’s house. When they got there, @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 had a snack together. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2, what do you want your @CAPS14 to have, a boy or a girl?"" asked @CAPS1. ""It really doesn't matter to me, @CAPS13, but if I had to choose, I would want a @CAPS16. I have already thought about it,"" answered @CAPS2. ""@CAPS10, be patient; you will get what you want,"" said @CAPS1. ""It's a girl!"" that was what the doctor said when my @CAPS14 gave birth to my new baby @CAPS16 on @MONTH1 @NUM1. I was so happy I wanted to just hold her, @CAPS13, but every time I asked, @CAPS12 was either too young or the timing wasn't right, so I gave up asking for a while. @CAPS13, finally, one day my @CAPS14 came into my room and said, ""Here, can you watch your @CAPS16 so I can take a @CAPS15?"" That was the happiest moment of my life, getting to spend that time with her. So me and my @CAPS16 grew up to be the best of friends, just like @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. That’s what happened when one learns to be a little patient."
121	17968	7	3	"My teacher said, ""We are starting the MEAP test!"" A collective ""Uhhh,"" sighed the class exactly at the same time. After the teacher passed out our booklets, we carefully filled in the information, wrote our names neatly, and began. As the test dragged on, I worked steadily and was soon finished! But there were slow workers who were very slow, and I was incredibly bored! There was nothing to do but sit down quietly. I wanted to complain about the wait, but I decided not to for the sake of my classmates. Finally, part one was finished. ""Time for part two, class!"" exclaimed the teacher. ""Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me,"" I said quietly to myself. Part two was thankfully short, but it still took one kid forty-five minutes! At the end of the day, the teacher was very proud of me for being so patient. Later that year, my MEAP results came in and they were fantastic, which made all the waiting feel worthwhile."
122	17969	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was going to my grandma's house because the car ride was five hours long. I was hungry, bored, and really needed to use the bathroom. I didn't tell nobody because I knew we could not stop just for me. I looked out the window at the passing cars and fields, but I soon got bored of that, too. We were going to the city, and I was happy knowing we would stop and eat there. I know that from my town to the city is not a long way for some, but hey, I eat at eleven and it felt like noon to me. We finally got to eat, like having an hour in the city to relax and enjoy our food. I did really good being patient, because when I am impatient I get really moody and people don't want to be with me when I'm in a mood, so it was a good day after all.
123	17970	7	3	A patient person is someone that can deal with difficulties without complaining. Like when you're waiting in the doctor's office for a checkup, or perhaps in the eye doctor's chair, or maybe at the dentist. When you're in the doctor's office, it is all quiet and then suddenly there is a phone ringing loudly! Then the doctor walks in, or the dentist, but mostly all there is is a lot of waiting and waiting, which requires a calm and quiet endurance.
124	17971	7	3	"""Time to go outside!"" the teacher said, happy that the children would get a break soon. All the kids ran outside to the playground. ""Come play with us; we were playing jump rope!"" one of the girls said sweetly as she swung the jump rope around. The little girl smacked her little flat shoes on the cement just light enough for Sarah to hear. ""I’m waiting,"" said the little girl impatiently. ""Hurry on,"" the boy said with an upset tone! ""Fine!"" the little girl said as she crossed her arms and swayed back and forth. One of the boys came up to Sarah too. ""Sarah, do you want to play tag, or hide and seek?"" ""Okay,"" the boy said sweetly with his arms folded nicely in his lap as he ran away waving his arms around. Sarah laughed at him and then thought, if I play with him then my other friend will be mad. But the girl was being mean too! The little boy, particularly waiting for Sarah’s mind to be made up, hopped about like a bunny trying to make her laugh again. ""Sarah!!!"" The little girl said, jumping up and down, making her little plastic shoes click as they hit the ground. ""I don’t have to play with you,"" Sarah said, ""but I am your best friend."" The girl said, getting a glare that only her mom would forgive. ""Your puppy dog eyes don’t work on me!"" Sarah said. ""Fine!"" the girl said again and the little girl ran off. ""I can play with you now,"" the boy said. ""Let's play tag?"" he said, laughing. Then the boy said, ""Thanks for playing with me,"" and they all started to run around together."
125	17973	7	3	Last Saturday I went to Cedar Point amusement park. And we drove for hours! Oh my gosh, my butt hurt! We got there and there were no parking spots, so we went to the way back lot! But then I was excited as we were walking towards the park entrance. I saw the Wicked Twister and was surprised when my dad asked me to pick the first ride; I said the Wicked Twister. So we got in line and I looked at the line for the Wicked Twister and guess what? It took thirty minutes to get on the ride. I was so patient that day, and then we cut the corner and there was like twenty more people ahead of us! So that day I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole one-pound burger with fries and a shake! So there's my story about my patience at the amusement park.
126	17974	7	3	Crash. Boom! Oh no, there's a accident. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 traffic stops. “We can't stop. not now,” yells my younger sister. “I'm gonna be late for dance class.” Oh @PERSON1 just be patient; this traffic will be moving before you know it, I said. As minutes passed, @PERSON1 announced she has to go to the bathroom. My mom tells her she has to wait, but she replies, “I don't want to wait.” I sat and looked out the window silently because that's all I really could do in the unmoving car. Then @PERSON1 screams, “I have to go to the bathroom, now!” “@PERSON1, I said please just be patient,” I repeated, feeling a bit frustrated. I gave her a candy from my pocket, which only shut her up for a couple of minutes. @NUM1 minutes passed and my sister is fast asleep, her head leaning against the window. I asked mom when she thinks the traffic is going to blow over. She told me she has no idea and just sighed. @NUM2 minutes later, the traffic starts to move slowly, but then stops, and then starts to move again in a frustrating pattern. Finally, we arrived at our exit and my sister makes it to the dance class, just in time. She got out of the car and dashed into the studio without looking back. That was a time I was patient, stuck in the car with my restless family.
127	17975	7	3	About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, the sun dusky, @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except for the drive, which involved four hours in the car with my older and younger siblings. It was loud, there was crying, there was all of that annoying junk, but I was patient and tried to ignore the chaos. When my family and I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, it was incredibly crowded! Like jam pack crowded, with people everywhere. My mom took my little sister and brother on the kiddy rides, and my dad took my brother and me. My group went on all of the big scary rides, one after another. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time, towering over the park. I was dying to go on it, my eyes fixed on its loops. My group got in line and quickly realized the line was about half a mile long and the park was going to close soon. Twenty minutes later… I was being so patient in this line, even as it inched forward slowly. We were only in the quarter of a mile range in the line when my dad decided it wasn’t worth the wait anymore. So my group met up with the rest of my family, and we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1, the ride's lights fading behind us. It was one of the most saddest ride move ever, a real disappointment. So maybe next time I should be more patient and wait just a little longer for what I really want.
128	17976	7	3	Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn’t just waiting a long time; it's being respectful and not complaining about the wait, even when it's difficult. In order to be patient, you have to be respectful and quiet unless you are asked something directly. It takes hard work and self-control to be patient, especially when you are eager for something to happen. If you're at school and need to go to the bathroom, for example, wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he or she is busy on Powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when they're talking, as it shows a lack of consideration. People will like you a little more if you are patient, because it shows you respect their time and situation. So remember, when you're waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience and take a deep breath.
129	17977	7	3	When I was in third grade, I befriended one of my classmates who had some disabilities, but I had to learn to be patient with him. When it comes to dealing with someone like him, patience plays a great part in friendship and understanding his unique needs. Even though he had his difficult days where he would get frustrated or act out, I would say to myself, ''you have to understand him and have patience,'' and that thought helped me stay calm. To this day, him and I are still friends, and I value the bond we built through those early lessons in patience and acceptance.
130	17978	7	3	I will tell you about a time I was patient. For a long time, it was a test of my endurance, and I hope you will read about it. I was going to @LOCATION1 to go to Disney World. It took forever! It took three whole days of driving, which felt like an eternity. We played games like I Spy or on our Game Boys to pass the time in the backseat. We very rarely took breaks, only for peeing or eating at quick roadside stops. I still didn't like the trip; the cramped car was uncomfortable. But when we finally got there, it was absolutely worth the long, patient wait. We had some fun, making memories that made all the driving feel unimportant in the end.
131	17979	7	3	"One day I was at home getting ready to go out to eat. I arrived at the restaurant and found a very long line, which was frustrating. So I was on the phone with @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1, and we were talking about the upcoming @CAPS1 test. I grew impatient and said, ""@CAPS2, why is this taking forever?"" They told me to be patient and wait until it was time to order. I asked what ""patient"" means, and they explained it means to understand, be tolerant, and not complain. I decided I might try that approach. I focused on our conversation and stopped watching the line, and then before I knew it, I was sitting at a table eating my food while still on the phone at Red Lobster. So now I know whenever I go somewhere with long lines, all I have to do is be a lot more patient and not complain, and the time will pass much more quickly."
132	17980	7	3	"This is a story about a time I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1. There was a huge campground where you can reserve an area and camp there. The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away. So I packed a magazine, some paper, and my @CAPS1, and decided to make the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing against each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour, but as we played, all I could think about was the camp. Later, I was looking at a magazine; I didn’t know it was about camping at first, and seeing the pictures made me more excited. Then I drew pictures for about half an hour, which was fun. I ended up taking a nap for another half hour. When I woke up, I just stared at the road wide-eyed, constantly thinking about camp. Finally, my dad said, ""@CAPS2, we are here kids!"" We all cheered, ""@CAPS3!"" We arrived at @CAPS4, and all of us @CAPS5. We set up camp, played on the playground, went swimming, and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it for the fun we had, though the ride home seemed a lot quicker. That is the story of a time I was patient on a long journey."
133	17981	7	3	Hi, I'm writing about the topic of patience. I think patience is very important to the world because if no one had patience, everyone would be running around crazy like banshees and getting mad all the time. It is important to have patience because in life it’s not always fair, and you have to wait your turn. For example, when I go to get my allergy shots, I have to be patient because other people got there first and need to get served before me. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can't play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people who aren’t patient can make other people impatient as well. Another term for not being patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience to help things run smoothly. That is what this world needs, a little more patience to make it a better place for everyone. THE @CAPS2.
134	17982	7	3	This is a story about one time when my mom was patient. One time, me and my mom were at the clinic to get my medicine. We were one of the first people there in the waiting room. Then a lot more people started to come in after us. My mom thought we would be the first people to get called back, but we weren't. First, @NUM1 groups were called, and then @NUM1 more groups got called after that. We continued to wait patiently, and then @NUM3 more groups got called before us. My mom just sat quietly, reading a pamphlet, and didn't complain at all. Then me and my mom finally got called to see the doctor, and we got the medicine we needed. That was the story of the time when my mom was patient during a long wait at the clinic.
135	17983	7	3	Have you ever learned patience just one time in your life? I have, and let me tell you about it. One day I was at home watching TV. All of a sudden, I had to use the bathroom really badly. Unfortunately, both my mom and my sisters had to go first. My mom went first, and my sister was going next. My mom didn’t take very long, but my sister was in there for a while. I was getting mad, but I still was waiting patiently. I was holding it in, but I knew eventually that it was going to come out. I was doing all I could to wait my turn without causing a scene. I thought about banging on the door, but I just waited instead. Finally, my turn came, and I went into the bathroom and handled my business. In conclusion, this is a story about a time that I was patient even when it was very difficult.
136	17984	7	3	Patience is a virtue. It’s something that we all need in life. Without it we can’t do anything that requires patience. People would get bored and frustrated because they have no patience to see things through. Now, here’s a time I was patient. After a holiday, I decided to buy an iPod touch. Since no stores were open, I had only one other option: online shopping. I used a popular website to get it. I couldn’t wait to get it! Unfortunately, I had to wait like a week for it to arrive. It was boring waiting for it, but I had other things to occupy my mind, like schoolwork and spending time with friends. When it finally came, I was so happy! I was glad I waited patiently for the delivery. From this experience, I learned you can’t get everything right away. I learned that for people who wait, good things will come to them. Also, I was better at waiting for everything after that. That’s how I was patient and have been better at being patient ever since.
137	17985	7	3	"Over the summer, on the Fourth of July to be exact, me and my family wanted to see fireworks at a local park. It was a time for me and my brother to visit all my friends, and we were so excited that it took us more than an hour to get there due to the heavy traffic. I was so patient because I knew if I wasn't, my mom would not be in a happy mood. ""Are we there yet?"" my brother moaned from the back seat. ""Be patient, my brother, we just got in the car,"" I said. My brother has always been impatient, but I of course didn't say a word on the way there, and every time he said something, the ride felt even longer and more tedious. I focused on the scenery outside the window, knowing that our destination would be worth the long, quiet wait in the car."
138	17986	7	3	Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in my days. I'm going to tell you about a time that I was patient and it paid off. It was in the fall, exactly two months before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was too young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but me, and this was partly true. She told me she would think about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was November now, just five more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, and I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought about that phone for weeks, imagining all the things I could do with it. Then the day came, it was my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also Thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday surprise. I opened my presents from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opened it, and it was my phone. I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted. That's why you should always be patient, and wait for good things to come.
139	17987	7	3	One day when I was home alone I felt nobody was with me. I was home alone because my uncle was very sick and my parents went to go visit him in the hospital. I was very scared and I felt that God had left me all by myself. So I prayed and prayed but I felt or heard nothing back. So I fell asleep and I heard a gentle voice, he was talking to me! In my dream, I was running in a field with tall grass. I saw a man dressed in white walking through a muddy path, and when he came out of the mud there was no dirt or stain anymore on him. I ran up to him and asked, “Man, who are you?” He replied and said, “Little child of God, why do you look so lonely? I am your angel, and I have come to tell you what your father has said.” He talked to me for a long time, and I did not feel scared or lonely anymore. There was one cloud in the sky, and he said he had to go but that he was my guardian angel. After that he rose into the sky. I will never forget him, he is my angel. And that was the time I needed to have patience to hear God's voice comforting me in my time of fear.
140	17988	7	3	The time when I was patient was when Christmas came around. At first I just wanted Christmas to get here right away. But my mom told me I had to just wait and that it will come soon enough. So I waited and waited because I really wanted a Wii console and the Sims 3 game. I thought about playing it every day, which made the wait feel even longer. So finally when Christmas came, I got what I wanted and some extra gifts too. Usually I am not that patient, but the reason I was is because my mom told me that it will come soon if I could just be calm. I learned that when you really want something or really want to do something, the more patient you are, the faster and more rewarding it will feel when it finally arrives.
141	17989	7	3	Every day I have this kid sit by me on the bus. He is annoying every day but I listen to him anyway. We usually get along but we debate about things sometimes, like which superhero is the strongest or the best video game. He tells outrageous story about @CAPS1 and snipers, describing epic battles with such wild detail that it's hard to believe. He’s not really my friend but he is one to talk to. I think if I listen and talk to this kid is a god sent mission because he doesn’t have many friends, and everyone needs someone who will hear them out, even if their stories are a bit much sometimes.
142	17990	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I believe we should be patient. I think patience is something we all need in the future. You can be patient while at the fair, in the lunch line, and when you're teaching a dog tricks. I’m going to talk about patience at the fair. You should be patient at the fair. When you're in line for rides, you need to be patient and wait your turn without pushing. When you're getting tickets or a bracelet, you need to be patient with the cashier. That is one way you need to be patient. Now the lunch line. You need to be patient. We all are going to eat so we should wait calmly. I have people yell at me all the time because they didn’t have patience. That’s another way we should have patience. Now teaching your dog tricks. @CAPS1 one you need a lot of patience. You can’t just expect a dog to know tricks; @CAPS1 is a working progress. You need to be slow and patient, repeating the same command many times. That is why you need to be patient. You need patience at the fair, in the lunch line, and teaching a dog tricks. At the fair you need to be patient. At school you need patience. At home you need patience. That is why patience is important for getting through each day successfully.
143	17991	7	3	"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I didn't have it once, but I learned. And I'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad was making hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill. My mom was setting up the table. And me and my siblings were playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chosen to teach my little brother, we tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining to him the object of the game, so they gave up and went to swing. Me, on the other side, said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and over what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it' so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside,"" my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even though he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from my hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job."" He ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really glad that I had taken the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient and it paid off."
144	17992	7	3	To me when someone is being patient they are in line or waiting for something and they're being very calm. They aren't fidgeting or complaining about the long wait. Where they aren't rushed and are very quiet, perhaps reading a book or just watching the world go by without any sign of frustration. It is a quiet strength that helps them get through a boring or difficult situation without making a fuss, and that is what true patience looks like.
145	17993	7	3	My brother's checkup was today, why did I come? All I did was sit patiently for @NUM1, there was nothing I could do @CAPS1 I kept my cool. Waiting there in a dark room was hard; the only light came from a small lamp on the side table. I picked up a nearby car magazine and started flipping through it, @CAPS1 the interesting thing was an article about a new @CAPS2 coming out. I read that in @NUM2 I went to the bathroom, and really soon was back in the wasteland of darkness. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple of people, hoping for a distraction. Five minutes passed and no answer, so I closed my eyes and laid my head back against the stiff chair, so I waited and waited. Right when I was about to bash my head on a brick wall from sheer boredom, my brother enters the room and says “That’s it”. And then I got a text by two people, it would have been better while I was bored out of my mind! At least the waiting was finally over.
146	17996	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was snowmobiling with my family. Because my dad and I have to get them warmed up and get them off the trailer and start them, and he has to ride one around and get us a track started. Then I ride behind him on the other sled and I must get the snow gear on, and that is not always easy. Finally, we go to my aunt and uncle's house in @LOCATION1, where we can ride on the open trails. I’ve been to a lot of places on the sleds, and this experience taught me the value of taking things one step at a time. It was a lesson in patience that made the whole day more enjoyable in the end.
147	17997	7	3	This is the time when I was patient with my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and me live in the same apartment building, so we hang out all the time. One day I had an @CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasn't liking the @CAPS1, and then she said “she was scared” of rollercoasters, but I told her it wouldn't be a big deal, we will not go on big rides. The day of the carnival came; I was excited and so was @PERSON1. As we got there she was really scared to go on the rides, so I told her we could go on the smallest ride first. After we went on a few smaller ones, she wasn’t scared as much. Then, while we were walking, she saw a ride, one of the biggest rides there, and she said we should go on that. So then I told her if she wanted to, we could go on it, and she was sure. After that ride we kept going on different bigger rides. While we were walking she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend. In summary, that was the time I had patience for a friend, and it strengthened our bond through understanding and support.
148	17998	7	3	There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with them. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour just to get inside the park. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first, we found a long queue. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride itself. Other rides we went on too had a long wait, so throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait in another line; with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines, helping each other pass the time. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person, a lesson that has been valuable in many other situations since.
149	18000	7	3	The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved forward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour, not moving. Finally the pilot got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an additional hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane again. As we started moving forward the plane’s wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendants helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I agreed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3, and I was proud of myself for staying calm.
150	18001	7	3	One time I got sent to my room, and I had to sit on my bed and I could @CAPS1 do anything. I asked one time to get out and he added more time to my punishment. So for about an hour and a half I had to sit in my room with nothing to do. I took a nap for about twenty minutes to pass some of the time. I was so bored, just staring at the walls and waiting for the time to be over. Then he finally let me out, and I learned that complaining only makes a difficult situation last even longer.
151	18002	7	3	"Once, I was @NUM1 old and I was so eager about getting a new bike I didn't have no patience at all. So that day I asked my dad, ""Can I get a new bike?"" He said, ""Not now."" I pleaded, ""Pleaseee,"" and he replied, ""Later then."" After that day, my dad was getting dressed in his nice clothes, and I thought, ""Yes!! That's for my bike!"" I went to my dad and told him I was ready. He said, ""What? Where are you going?"" I said, ""With you,"" but then he said, ""No, not now."" I got so angry and went to sit down. After an hour had passed, my dad finally showed up. I ran so fast to him and said, ""Can we go now?"" He told me, ""Ali, be patient."" I complained, ""Why? You said we were going to go."" My dad just parked the car and went downstairs to eat his lunch. So I started to get angry again; I went to the couch and sat there, watching @CAPS1 while my dad was eating. After he was done, he finally said, ""Ali, let's go!"" I asked, ""Where to?"" He answered, ""To buy you a bike."" I ran so fast and hugged my dad, then went to get dressed. After I got my new bike, I understood the value of being patient."
152	18004	7	3	"This is a story of when I was patient. I believed in aIeons, the mysterious beings from the sky. So I went out into a large, open field and sat down in the tall grass to wait for them. I was about @NUM1 years old at the time. So I thought to go out there, and I am out there waiting and waiting for what felt like hours. Then I saw something streak across the sky; my gosh, it's just a shooting star. I was so excited, but it wasn't one of them. All of a sudden, I saw a deer emerge from the trees, and it was running right after me. So I shot it with my toy gun. Then I was waiting; I was waiting some more. I was getting bored, so I made up a little song to pass the time: ""I am waiting for the aIeons, yes I am waiting, yes I am."" When it got dark out, I saw something incredible. It was the aIcons. A glowing space craft stopped right in the field. The aIeons walked out and shot all of them with their strange devices. Then they took them home, and I showed them to the whole town. They didn't believe me at first, so I told them to go to the field and look at the space craft for themselves, and they all fainted from the shock. That's a time I was patient, and it was definitely worth it."
153	18005	7	3	Patience was key when arriving to Cedar Point; there was one ride I really wanted to go on, that is the @CAPS1. The only problem is that it is a @NUM1 hour wait. Standing there in the blazing hot sun on a typical @NUM2 @CAPS2 day, I was having second thoughts. Looking up and seeing the light and the @CAPS3, difficult shades of green track of the ride, I knew it was worth the wait. After @NUM3 minutes, @PERSON1, my brother, was all ready bored. So we played @NUM4 rounds of @CAPS4 to pass the time. I won every time. Almost an hour later, we get to the first stop and struck magic. I get three pops and about @NUM5 candy bars, while @PERSON1 got double the amount of me. Two hours later, we got to the elevator which was meant to bring us up into the ride. At the top, they strap us into the front row seats! What luck we had. Crank! Crank! Crank! Went the roller coaster as it slowly trudged up the steep hill. Then our cart dipped down and we were @CAPS2 going @NUM5 miles per hour; we went up, down, side to side, and even upside down for three intense minutes. When we finally pulled back into the station, @PERSON1 had punched the air @NUM1 times. Meeting my group back at the car, we began the @NUM8 hour car ride home, and I turned to my brother and said it is another one, so our game of @NUM4 @CAPS5 began again.
154	18006	7	3	When I was ten years old my mom promised me a phone. But then she said I had to wait until @CAPS1. That got me mad because @CAPS1 wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchscreen with a key board, the exact one I had dreamed of. But I tried to be as patient as I could. The next day I kept seeing these commercials of the phone I wanted, which made the waiting even harder. It was very difficult to be patient but I tried my best. So everyday I had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone, like schoolwork or playing outside. Also, a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them and be included. Before I knew it, it was only a week until @CAPS1 so I was excited, even though I had to pay for the phone bill myself. I just wished the time would fly, but it seemed to move slowly. So all I decided to do was wait patiently. After six days had past, tomorrow was already @CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting had finally paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand new phone! My heart started beating with excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom repeatedly. So being patient will eventually pay off, as it did for me.
155	18008	7	3	When I was in fourth grade, I was going to a concert and I had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long, winding line to get into the venue. While I was in line I started talking to my friends; we played simple games and walked a few steps up every few minutes as the line slowly advanced. I sat there on the ground for a while, then walked up with my mom and sat down again, and it just seemed like the line wasn’t moving at all! The sun was warm and the wait felt endless. Finally, we got up to the front of the line, and me and my friends were so excited, our energy renewed. Being patient paid off because if I would have bothered my mom too much about the wait, she might have gotten mad at me and it would have spoiled the mood. I had a lot of fun after I got into the concert, the music was amazing and we had great seats. That was a time that I was patient, and it made the final reward all the sweeter.
156	18011	7	3	Patience is used when people are not in a hurry to get where they are going. Like checking out at a store or at work, some people can be rude and not use their patience. At school and work you should always use your patience, like for an example, use my patience at Kinchat School because there are over one hundred first graders, and half of them are pushy when it's lunch time and the other half gets hurt and they honestly don’t know what to do. It can be a very chaotic scene in the hallways and the lunchroom, with children bumping into each other and sometimes starting to cry. In these situations, taking a deep breath and waiting calmly is the best approach. Losing your temper only makes the confusion worse for everyone involved. Learning to be patient in these everyday moments helps make the entire day go more smoothly and teaches others by example. This is why practicing patience is so important in our daily interactions.
157	18012	7	3	A time I was patient is when I took my black belt test. It took two days to take the test. My test was on a Saturday and Sunday, from about ten to about two pm. I passed my test! I then had to wait (patiently) until the following Tuesday the karate association called, and I received my official karate level one. That is/was my greatest accomplishments in my whole life so far it wasn’t easy. I started when I was five, and I am now twelve. I had to perform three kata I knew at the time, and about twenty stances, punches, kicks, blocks, and breaks. Five minutes of sparring, also called kumite (kun five minutes of practical self defense. I also needed to make a poster, a parent recommendation, and teacher recommendation, a five-page written report, and a written essay. I needed to perform a kata and show self defense application and do a bo staff weapon skit and practical self defense skit and send in a progress report and/or most current report card. In conclusion, I had to “earn” my karate black belt, [no animals or person were harmed in the making of this incredible martial artist/black belt] (my life story). It was a long and challenging journey that truly taught me the value of perseverance and calm dedication over many years.
158	18013	7	3	One time I went to Cedar Point and I was riding in the car. And we were about an hour away from the Cedar Point park. And I was talking with my sister and my friend and I fell asleep. And then we were there I was so excited and that I couldn’t wait to go on the rollercoaster. And I was walking in the park with my sisters, mom, and dad into the park and all I could hear was people scream on the rollercoaster and then we were in line for the rollercoaster and I was in the back of the line and I was too impatient and I was like in my mind come on come on and I was in like feeling like I didn’t want to go on it anymore and then it was time to ride the rollercoaster and I went on it and I was off the ride in matters of sixty seconds. and that was my story of patience. The entire thrilling experience was over so quickly, which made me realize that my impatience in line was unnecessary and that good things are worth waiting for, even if just for a short while.
159	18014	7	3	Patience is a virtue I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something takes too long. In summer camp seriously there was an event called the final show. It was raining and many people wanted to see if the camp would close down. The rain inconveniently did stop but I had to wait until six pm! So in other words my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was an unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with high-pitched squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally they let us in at six o'clock, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I’m glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait. The performers were amazing and the entire spectacle was so entertaining that it made the long, frustrating wait beforehand completely worthwhile in the end.
160	18015	7	3	"One day when I was going to the beach we drove for a whole day because we went in the wrong direction and my mom got mad at night we were trying to find a hotel about one thirty am I was the only one aware because my three brothers, my sister and me were in the front and I got really angry because a guy took the last room they had but I was really patient and eventually we got a room the next day we went to the resort to stay we were going to the water park/amusement park there was a new ride ""the scorpion's tail"" but we had to wait for an hour to go on that ride and I was really patient but my mom was getting tired and mad because it took so long then the next day it rained and rained so we went to the indoor pool at our hotel but we couldn't go in because there were too many people so we had to wait but I wasn't patient because I wanted to go swimming after almost a half hour we got to go swimming then the next day we had to leave and this time it took almost two days to get us back home the time we got there was at midnight I was patient enough to help my parents get all the stuff in our house then we finally got to go to bed I was so happy. The entire trip was a long test of my patience, but helping unload the car at the very end made me feel proud that I had managed to stay calm through so many delays."
161	18016	7	3	"""Alright kids. Today we are going to look into our microscopes. I will pick your partners,"" said Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson picked Sarah to be my partner. I think she is really smart. We were assigned to microscope number three. The teacher told us we had to draw everything we see in our notebooks. Sarah looked into the microscope first, and saw blue lines scattered everywhere. ""Hey, can I see?"" I asked. ""Just a minute, I have to draw it in my notebook,"" replied Sarah. ""Sarah, hurry up."" I said, not noticing I was being impatient. ""Okay, who can accept David in their group? He needs a partner,"" asked Mr. Johnson. Sarah looked up from the microscope and raised her hand. ""We can!"" said Sarah. ""Great! Really Sarah?"" I complained. ""Michael, don’t be rude. You know he is new to our class,"" said Mr. Johnson. David walked over, got a chair and sat down right in front of me. He was patiently waiting for Sarah to draw what she saw in her notebook. ""Sarah, can you go any slower?"" I shouted. ""Michael, can you yell any louder?"" she shouted back. Finally it was David’s turn. He looked at the microscope and started drawing. I tried to peek at Sarah’s paper. She noticed, and I quickly glanced back. ""Michael, you really need to wait your turn and be patient. We will all get a chance to look through it,"" Sarah said to me. ""You’re right. Thanks Sarah. I’m sorry I was acting like that,"" I said. ""it’s alright, I act like that too, sometimes. Maybe we should all sit together at lunch,"" suggested Sarah. ""That would be cool,"" agreed David."
162	18017	7	3	Being patient is sometimes hard but sometimes you don’t care. There are many times I was patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or thirty minutes. There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom dropped me off at four o'clock. I waited five minutes because I was a little early. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they weren’t. After waiting thirty minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at four thirty. I could of called home but I didn’t have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When it was four thirty my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, “it starts at four thirty. So I have to leave”. She kept asking me why I didn’t call and I kept telling her I didn’t have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humbling to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I can’t go an hour. That's one of the horrible times I was patient, but I managed it.
163	18018	7	3	I was patient when I had to watch two little bad girls at my sisters house. My sister asked if I wanted to spend the night. I did then her god kids came over. That night my sister remembered she had to go some were. So that morning she left me with the kids for three hours. The girls were running around and being loud, so I had to wait patiently for her to come back. I tried to keep them busy with games. Finally she did return, and I was relieved.
164	18019	7	3	One day I had to wait about three hours which seemed like a year, but I didn’t complain. I sat in the doctors office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom texted her freind. About three people got called in fourty- five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine. They called a kid who’s name was Michael, and I thought it was me because my names Mitchell. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but its just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finnally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finnally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with there machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I don’t know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finnally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, “I have not a clue, I just was.”
165	18020	7	3	When I was going to the doctor I had to be patient. I went there because my auntie driveway had a crack. And I was riding my scooter. I must wasn’t paying no attention because my scooter had hit the crack so I sprang my knee. So my dad camed out the house to pick me up. I had to get in a wheel chair. And wait because there wasn’t no more curtains left. The waiting room was very full. I waited for a hour then I got my turn. And they checked my knee. Then they gave me crutches to walk with. It was pretty hard to go up my house stairs, but I managed it patiently.
166	18021	7	3	I was patient when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my @CAPS1. I was patient because I didn’t want to get really excited about @CAPS2. When I get excited about things we have a change in plans, and we would have to ‘cancel’. So I stayed calm and we were in the car in a little over an hour, then my brother forgot something and we had to go back and get @CAPS2, and I was patient about @CAPS2, even though we were quiet the whole way there. I had to keep my feelings in check, and this is the story of when I was very patient about going to @LOCATION1, and it all worked out in the end.
167	18022	7	3	Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and pasted it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up, making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call, but @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place, yet @CAPS2 he didn’t. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. It was just my mom asking if he got the job, and @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, “@CAPS1 do you want!” @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always need to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter @CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @MONTH1 not be an expert, but @CAPS2 he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way, just as they did for him.
168	18023	7	3	"Super beast patience. I was coming here from school one day on the going bus, so @CAPS1 what felt like @CAPS2, I finally got home and I ran inside. I saw my high school bro with a box of pop. I asked, ""Blare, where did you get the money for that? It always needs money."" You wouldn't guess what he said. He said, ""I took it out of your wallet."" I yelled, ""What? I have been holding that in there so I could go to the movies."" As I thought with my @NUM1 friends, I got so angry. So I ran out and jumped in the air, punched him right in the nose. It started bleeding. I tried to run but he grabbed me. He could really hurt me at any time, but he said, ""I'll pay you back,"" when he let me go. So I thought, now he is so patient with me; he could have killed me and he didn't. The next week he saved me back, and he hasn't hit me since, showing true patience."
169	18025	7	3	"""When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here!"" I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family and my cousins were going to be coming in from @LOCATION1. I was so excited and very impatient I couldn’t wait until they pulled up in their black car and I could give them a hug that would knock the daylights out of them. It was around lunch time and I was watching out the window while eating cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten saying they are going to be here in @NUM1, but they were never there. Soon I realized it was about @NUM2 p.m. and knew I wouldn’t see them until tomorrow and I will be patient so I don’t waste the whole entire day thinking about it. After a good night's rest I got up, had breakfast, and then watched some @CAPS2. ""@PERSON1! @PERSON1! Honk! Honk!"" Could it really be? No, it couldn't; it was uncle @CAPS3 and his big motorcycle. A few hours later I heard @PERSON1 again and said uncle @CAPS3 is probably leaving, but then I heard my cousins @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5. I flew up out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key to a happy reunion."
170	18026	7	3	A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me how to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And that's when she told me these words: “practice makes perfect.” She let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it, showing me the motions again and again. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time, never getting frustrated. And that is an example of one time someone was truly patient with me, which helped me learn a valuable skill.
171	18028	7	3	One time it was hard to wait, but I was patient and in the end it was worth it. One time my family and I were going to Disney world. The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get to the air port and go to Disney world. After we packed the car we drove to the airport. In the car my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport we got super excited! When we got to the area were you wait for your plane the workers told every one waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to Florida was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to Disney world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait, we walked around the air port and, and got something to eat. Then we heard that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just sat down and talked and before we knew it we were getting on the plane. Being patient can really help the situation and make the final reward feel even better.
172	18029	7	3	On Saturday it was my birthday I was just turning ten. I was so happy!!! Well while I was being happy and my big sisters were getting things together for my party my mom was at work. We had everything at the party such as juice, pop, food, candy, chips, ice cream, but no cake. My mom was supposed to pick it up when she got off work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After we opened all my gifts, it was time for cake and ice cream. We had the ice cream but no cake, but I didn’t cry and scream like a baby, my sister did but she was still six and I was ten and I had to act as a ten year old. My mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she got my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I was happy I waited like a big kid, but I was even more happier I was ten and had learned the value of patience.
173	18030	7	3	I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat last summer. I was babysitting with my older cousin Sarah. We were babysitting twin four-months-old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cried a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down and it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm her down. Another event during that day that I used patience was to get them to fall asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down in my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, Natalie, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. Sarah, my cousin also used her patience when “her baby,” Chloe, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun and you can see that Natalie and Chloe were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and Sarah through it successfully.
174	18031	7	3	Patience is a very long task but the rewards outweigh the time you waited for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up to standing in a line for a roller coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However many people are not very patient. (Including me) But they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. It is a skill that improves with practice and mindful effort. In short, be calm during a trial and use lots of patience to see things through to a better end.
175	18032	7	3	One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in Ann Arbor and there was a lot of traffic and me my sister and my brother were in the car (we ended up waiting for two hours) I was really unhappy so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I know. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down. I found out I was late so we had to go back home and do it again tomorrow. That experience taught me a clear lesson about the importance of patience, even when it feels difficult.
176	18033	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to Cedar Point. We drove from our home in the city all the way to the theme park, and it was a very long ride. When we finally got there, we discovered a long, winding line just to get into the parking lot. My mom said, “All right guys, time to be patient.” Once we got through the gates, we headed straight for the first ride we saw, which also had a long, snaking queue of people. Mom looked at us and said, “We are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides.” We stood in that line quietly, knowing she was right, and eventually we did get on the ride, which made the wait feel worthwhile in the end.
177	18034	7	3	"Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friend's house on a trampoline one hot summer day. When my brother broke his finger, he was crying and it seemed like he was in terrible pain. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother, because she was so focused on him. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day after the accident and got an appointment for my brother. I thought, okay, whatever, I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor, but there was one person in the way of that and her name is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day, I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go, but she wasn't buying any of them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting, and guess what else? If you said waiting, then you are right. In the waiting room, seconds got confused with minutes and minutes got confused with hours. Those ""hours"" of torture made the car ride look like a pleasant kitty ride. There was no entertainment or anything that could distract me from those cruel minutes going by so slow. If you have ever seen a snail go, imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally, after all of the time we'd been waiting, the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she was even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever, using words so long they made the dictionary look small. I was so tired that I stopped caring. Finally, it was time to go, though no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor's office. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother was in pain and had to go to the doctor. The doctor's office was extremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave. Sometimes being patient has rewards, and my reward was simply being able to leave the doctor's office."
178	18035	7	3	One time at the local sports store, I was getting some arrows but no one was there to ring up my purchase. The counter was empty, and instead of ringing the bell a hundred times or calling out loudly, I just waited there quietly and patiently, looking at the other items on the shelves. I was waiting for about ten minutes for someone to come, and when someone did finally come, they smiled and said thank you for being so patient. They then ringed me up quickly so I could leave with my new arrows. That was a time I was patient, and it felt good to be acknowledged for it.
179	18036	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was waiting in line for lunch at school. I was patient because there were lots of other people in the line ahead of me, and some people were letting their friends cut in front of them, so the line was getting longer instead of moving forward. I just stood in my place, knowing that getting upset wouldn't make the line move any faster, and eventually I did get my lunch. That is the story of one of the times I was patient, and it taught me that staying calm is the best way to handle a slow situation.
180	18037	7	3	One time I was patient was when my dad was going to send me a birthday present. I was just waiting and waiting for it to arrive in the mail. While I was waiting, I just went about my day; I slept, ate, played games in class a lot, and watched television. After two long weeks, I finally got it. The package contained a Donkey Kong game and one hundred dollars. I called my dad and said, thank you, after which I played my game all night and saved my hundred dollars until my actual birthday. That was the time I was patient, and the reward for my patience was definitely worth it.
181	18038	7	3	As I walked down the lane looking for the perfect gift I had seen the day before, I was disappointed to find out it was sold out. Today was my mom’s birthday, and I had my heart set on that gift, the perfect Precious Moments figurine. I asked the store manager if they happened to have any more in the back, but sadly, they didn’t. He offered a small hope, saying, “The new shipment should be arriving at five.” I didn’t think I could wait another three hours. My dad drove me home, and I spent the time pacing back and forth, thinking my anxiety would occupy the time, but sadly it didn’t. Finally, I realized I needed to relax and be patient, something I had struggled with before. Before I knew it, the time was five o’clock, and my dad and I went back to the store. In no time, there was the perfect gift, right there on the shelf in front of me. I picked it up and gave it to the clerk to scan. I handed her the money and headed straight home. When mom got home, I handed her the gift and watched her face light up, realizing that patience really does come in handy when it comes to waiting for something good.
182	18039	7	3	One day we were driving to the park for a very special event to see the President of the United States when we got to the location. There were cars parked a mile away from the entrance! When we finally found a spot and parked the car, we started walking. It was a long walk, but when we finally got to the gate I was so excited! After we got through the security checkpoint, we trudged on, feeling like we would never get there. Me and my parents stood in that line for what I think was about two hours. Until finally, everybody spread out and took their places. We sang the national anthem, and then the President stepped up to the podium and gave a long speech. It was the longest line I had ever stood in, and I was very patient throughout the entire experience.
183	18040	7	3	One day I was at a baseball game and the line to get inside the stadium was huge. It stretched out for what seemed like half a mile, and unfortunately, we were at the very end. So it took us about an hour just to get up to the front gates. I knew I had to be very, very patient during that long wait, or else my dad would’ve gone crazy with frustration. We finally made it inside just in time for the first pitch, so that’s my story about patience and how it helped us enjoy the game.
184	18041	7	3	There were only five minutes of class left and I had nothing to do. So I watched the clock tick down ever so slowly. With five minutes left, then four, then three, then two, the teacher asked, “What are you doing?” I said, “Nothing. I have nothing to do.” She suggested, “Why don’t you put your head down?” I was losing my patience and felt like I was going to snap, but I didn’t. I took a deep breath, put my head down on the cool desk, and the next thing I knew, the bell was ringing and it was time to go. I was glad I had kept my patience and didn’t get in trouble for being restless.
185	18042	7	3	Did you know that patience is one of the keys to happiness? For an example, I was walking and this guy walked up to me and started talking to me about his family. Just remember, I wasn’t very patient at the time. He kept going on and on about his relatives until I finally snapped and said, “Do you know how to shut up!” Sadly, he said “yes” and then ran home, crying. Later, I went home and when I got there, I felt sad for the guy. I found him and said, “I’m sorry!” And for some reason, he said, “Got you!” I said, “What?” I was so mad at the trick, but I was also happy when the awkward situation was over. But that whole experience taught me a lesson, though: always be patient because you don't know who is watching, literally.
186	18043	7	3	I am always patient with my family, my mom and dad do a lot for me and are always patient if they take me somewhere. Sometimes, for hockey practice, my mom and dad take me. Hockey is a sport I enjoy. My dad usually takes me but on Saturdays my mom takes me and I am patient. For homework, I am always patient, and if I go to my friend’s golfland my mom said she will take me and I’m always patient while waiting for her. I understand that being patient is important and helps everyone have a better day.
187	18044	7	3	Patience is a key virtue. My cousin Romeo is the most patient person I have ever met. He is studying to be a doctor, which means he must go through eight years of college. This involves eight years of learning complex terminology, studying cells, and understanding human anatomy, so he has to be incredibly patient. My cousin goes to a university which is pretty close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home a lot and never complains about his homework or school or anything; he has got the highest level of patience, trust me. He is the perfect role model for me. Romeo is on his fifth year of college, which means four years are down and four more to go. He doesn’t have a certain way of taking stress out besides the fact he squeezes his stress ball. It’s not easy staying motivated and relaxed, but he does that. Before he left for university, he told me that patience is half the process and half the reward. I truly believe that Romeo is patient and his example inspires me.
188	18045	7	3	Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called Lily's Patient Day. “Mom, hurry up and find my shoes! I can’t find them anywhere! And I do not want to be late for school again.” I hollered at my mom. “Lily,” Mom said in a hushed voice, “you asked me a second ago, it doesn’t take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient.” “I know, I know,” I sighed, “but I still don’t want to be late.” “I know,” she replied, “but remember, being patient will get you far.” “Okay,” I agreed. So that day at school, Lily remembered her mom's words and was very patient all day. She didn’t whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, and she didn’t cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didn’t grab the volleyball when someone had it at their shoe so she wouldn’t be bored; instead, she stood there calmly. During the end of the day, her friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period, they all got some candy as a reward. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in her next class, she could feel everyone's eyes on her, but she knew it was for a good reason. Everyone learned to raise their hands and not push when they left the classroom. Pretty soon, every student started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that day, I hugged my mom so hard and then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on, understanding its true value.
189	18046	7	3	The day I stood in line for some free bags of Lays chips was a test of patience. When I was at the store, they were giving out free bags of chips. I was number fifteen in line, and by the time I got to the front, my three friends were already there. They were having a giveaway day, and we got done with our bags late. I was really patient; I waited for four hours and fifteen minutes. We had some chips and then we left. Then we got in line for a video game, but we were very tired. We were going to the park later, but that was the worst patience I had ever had to use. It was a long day, but I managed to stay calm throughout the experience.
190	18047	7	3	It was a beautiful morning; the sky was blue, birds were singing, and my sister was going skydiving. She and her boyfriend, Zone, were planning to go skydiving, so me, my friend, and my parents tagged along to watch. We had a couple of people in front of them, so we had to wait for an hour or so. Then another hour passed, and they were still not even close to being their turn. We were starting to get hungry, so we went into town and ordered some breakfast. We got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call that they were going soon. We had to cancel our meal and hurry back to the place. We got there, and it was still not their turn. I don't really know how, but something happened with the wind, so we had to sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally, it was their turn; they got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while, and then it looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, then another followed. They sailed down to a successful landing. It turns out that we sat there for eight hours before they jumped, not including the hour and a half drive there. I think that I was pretty patient that day, despite all the waiting and delays.
191	18048	7	3	"Left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse sight! The boy's arms are moving so fast you can barely see them, a blur of motion. His legs are striking the heavy bag with tremendous power, each impact echoing through the training space! ""Excellent!"" the old man yells with pride, ""my boy."" His master, however, says calmly, ""you are still lacking patience."" The old man, a seasoned instructor named Master Chen, puts a thick blindfold on the boy named Leo and lets several sand bags swing towards him. The first one hits him squarely in the head, a sharp thud, but the boy instinctively kicks the second one and busts it open, sand spraying out. Leo grabs the third flying bag and uses it skillfully to block the path of the fourth one. Through this difficult exercise, the boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first, understanding that timing is as crucial as strength."
192	18049	7	3	"One time I was patient when our teacher, Mrs. Davison, could not get the projector to work. Everybody sat down at their desks and was quiet. It took up the whole class hour. There was a little chit-chat here and there, a soft murmur, but mostly everybody was quiet for her while a small group of students tried to help her. We were going to watch a movie about the five major themes of geography, but when she tried to play the movie, it wouldn't come on properly. You could hear the audio but couldn't see the picture, and then at the very end of the hour, you could finally see it but you couldn't hear it. ""But it worked for all the other classes,"" Mrs. Davison said, frustrated. The next day she gave us fruit snacks for being so patient, and she had finally gotten the movie to work; first it was in just gray and white, then she jiggled a card in the computer and it showed in color. But the day that I was patient was the first time. I was patient with a teacher, she was proud of me, and I was proud of myself. I can't believe what I did for Mrs. Davison. Then it happened again another time; this time she let everybody just chill in our chairs and talk with our friends, but I just waited for her to fix her technical problem. The next day she didn't give us a treat because our treat was just chilling in our chairs and talking with our friends. That was a time when my classmates and I were patient, learning that sometimes the reward is simply a moment of peace."
193	18050	7	3	When I was patient, we had to wait in a very long, winding line for a popular roller coaster. I was already scared, and some kids in the line behind me were impatient; they were pushing and complaining, wanting to get on the ride fast. I was patient and waited quietly with my family until, finally, after what felt like forever, we got on. I was very scared when I were on, gripping the safety bar tightly. When I got off, however, I had a big, bright smile on my face, my heart still racing with excitement. I was truly glad I was patient, because the thrilling experience was worth the long and anxious wait.
194	18051	7	3	"Being patient is fundamentally important. People should always be patient and not rush anything in life. All you really have to do is take your time and wait calmly. People need to understand that if you are not patient, then particular things you want will not happen for you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient to receive it. One day at the community center, my cousin, Shayna, was not being patient because she desperately wanted to get on the dance box. But, she couldn't because a little girl named Tamika was on the dance box, and Shayna was not happy about it. And you know how we girls can get with our attitudes. Shayna got mad and started to cry and roll her eyes at Tamika. She then came up to me and said, ""She won't let me get on."" I looked at her and said, ""Shayna, you have to be patient and wait your turn because she was on it first, and that would be rude and unfair to make her get off."" Shayna eventually calmed down, apologized for her behavior, and they both took turns on the dance box for the rest of the afternoon. In the end, Shayna was happy and she learned her valuable lesson about waiting."
195	18052	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip, she moved slower than my grandpa, each step a careful, painful effort. You are probably asking yourself how does this make her patient? Well, I had to follow her everywhere she went to ensure she didn't fall. If I wasn't patient, I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in. I mean, it took her almost fifteen long minutes just to walk from the living room to her bedroom. Normally I'm not a patient person at all, I get fidgety and annoyed easily, but when this happened I had no choice; I had to be patient. I'm glad that during that period I was patient because now I am more patient then I was before. My mom is proud of my behavior and my help, because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed me the most. Being patient is a good thing; it makes you look at life differently and appreciate small progress. Now I can actually imagine me being a more patient person. I mean I'm not glad my mum got hurt, but I'm glad of my personal growth, the positive consequence of the problem. After the big accident happened, I have truly learned that everyone needs a little bit of patience, just like I did. That is one powerful example about how I thought of a time I was patient, without my mom's accident I might never have learned this lesson so deeply.
196	18053	7	3	I know a girl, she’s my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all her veggies, does all her homework diligently, and has straight A's in all her classes. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient at all. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a Saturday night so it was quite busy. There was a long, winding line to @CAPS2 the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned loudly. I told her, “@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes.” @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms in frustration. “@CAPS2 over it you potato sak,” I told her with a small smile. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case scenario. She started pulling at her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, “@PERSON2, we gotta @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode!” I looked at her with my, why don’t you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded, taking a deep breath. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 throughout the night, making sure she didn’t go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didn’t @CAPS2 kicked out. You should always @CAPS1 patient or things @MONTH1 turn out bad, and I learned that being calm can help calm others down, too.
197	18054	7	3	Today I am talking about patents. Patents means to take something easy or to handle something with calmness. Like for example, I went to an @CAPS1 machean and I wanted to get money. @CAPS2 I put the card and the pin, then I wanted @NUM1 dolors but @CAPS3 gave me only the receipt, no @CAPS4 cash and no @CAPS4 cards. @CAPS2 I didn't break @CAPS3, I just called the company calmly and I got the money and the card back. Now this is the main story: I went to the mall to get a shoe. @CAPS3 was one hundred and ten dollars but @CAPS3 was on sale for one hundred dollars. @CAPS2 I wanted to buy it, the cashier man said “one hundred and ten dollars please.” @CAPS2 I told him “@CAPS3 was on sale,” he said “get out of my store.” @CAPS2 I told him I came to buy a shoe, but he wouldn't listen. @CAPS2 I returned @CAPS3 and went out without making a scene. That's a time when I was patient and handled a frustrating situation with composure.
198	18055	7	3	A time I was patient was when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 of @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 grandma @CAPS1, grandpa @PERSON1, and @CAPS4 brother @ORGANIZATION2. We were all just walking around and we saw a guy drawing cartoon pictures of people. I said, “grandma @CAPS1 can’t we do that please.” @CAPS3 said “yes.” @CAPS4 brother got to go first. I was just waiting for his to be done, watching the artist work. Then his picture was done, we looked at it and we all laughed at how funny it was. I was next; I sat on the seat and the sun was right on me. I got very hot and I did not just want to sit there, but I was patient. I didn’t say a word, just sat there and smiled for the artist. A picture that took about @NUM1 minutes to draw felt like a half hour. Then I was finally done. I looked at the picture, laughed and smiled; I liked it very much. I was patient and I got what I wanted, a fun memory and a cool drawing. That was a time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1.
199	18056	7	3	"I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1, ran out to the car, running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was, ""@CAPS2 need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded. ""@CAPS4 about at @NUM1?"" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3 brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. ""@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friend poured water purposely on @CAPS3 sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1"" ""@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do,"" @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. ""@CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened."" I held @CAPS3 breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS5 filled in the next part, ""@CAPS12 you started punching him?"" ""@CAPS13, yes."" @CAPS14 admitted miserably. ""@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,"" @CAPS15 scolded. ""I know, I know now. I'm sorry,"" @CAPS3 brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16"" I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day, learning to listen even when it was difficult."
200	18057	7	3	The place I was patient it was at my mom’s doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place at @LOCATION1 road and it was small and I had to wait out at the lobby and it was boring. I first started watching channel @NUM1 news and it got interesting for a little while. Then I went to the front counter, got a blue pen and a blank piece of paper, then begun drawing. When I finished drawing it looked like a car that looked, it was a far car; and then I began looking for something else to do. I began finding and finding and then there was a car magazine on a small table. There was cool cars inside: low riders, exotic cars, custom cars, and more, which kept me busy. When my mom was finally done, I had been patient the whole time and then we left home, and I felt good for waiting so calmly.
201	18058	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was standing in a long line at the petting zoo. The animal I was waiting in line to see was a donkey. It was a hot @DATE1 day around three in the afternoon, and of course the donkey was the crowd's favorite animal. There were only a couple of people observing the other animals, but in the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was positioned around the middle of the line, and I was getting tired from the heat and the wait, but I had to see this donkey! I was being very patient, waiting and waiting and waiting. The line inched forward slowly. Finally, only a couple of people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey's fuzzy ears. A couple more minutes passed and then I was petting the donkey's coarse fur: @CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo feeling happy and accomplished. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a pat on the back for sticking it out.
202	18060	7	3	"One time I was in the doctor's office and there were a lot of people there. I had just arrived with my dad, and he was telling me we should go because there were so many people waiting ahead of us. I said, ""Let's be patient and wait,"" and he agreed. So we sat down, and person after person was called in before us. My dad was patient, and so was I, even though it was @NUM1 hours until they finally called our name. We went into the examination room, and I got my five-year-old vaccines, the shots I needed. After it was done, we left the office and went home. We ate dinner, which was taco salad, and I felt good that we had waited so patiently."
203	18061	7	3	I’m really not a patient person, but one day last year at the end of the school year, my older sister @PERSON2 was having a baby. I wanted to go to the hospital because that was going to be my first nephew. So I went, and so did my grandma, my mom, my other sister, my # @CAPS1, and my sister @CAPS2, the one who was having the baby, and her boyfriend. There were lots of people there, and not all of us could go into the room at the same time. I was too young to see the baby born, but I didn’t want to anyway. My sister got mad because she couldn’t go in there either, so she left, but I stayed even though it was boring. I stayed patiently, and I went into the room to visit when it was allowed. It took @NUM1 hours for the baby to be born. We went at nine, and the baby was born around @NUM2. I went home to sleep at @NUM3 and went back to the hospital at @NUM2:00. We saw the baby at @NUM5; his name was @CAPS3, and he is so cute. I’m so glad to be his @CAPS4. Right now he is six months old, and I love when I see him. And when he is older he will know that I was there the whole time, waiting for him to be born. Love, @PERSON1.
204	18062	7	3	A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually, to me, a very funny way of showing impatience. My classmates and I were divided into groups at different areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification, identifying the different characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects by taping their plants onto their posters. After fighting for the tape from another group that was hogging it, our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came over to get some tape. One of them tried to take a few pieces, and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, “@CAPS1 @CAPS2!” as a sharp sign of impatience. It was hilarious how his tone conveyed all that frustration in just two words, and we all laughed about it afterward.
205	18064	7	3	When I was patient, I was @NUM1 yrs old when I got a DS. I ordered it online and waited. @NUM2 days went by and still nothing arrived. A full week went by, and then a UPS truck stopped at our house, dropped off a package, and left. I was so happy that I didn’t even notice that it was for my mom. I opened it excitedly only to find Pampered Chef stuff inside. I was really angry! Another @NUM3 weeks went by and… nothing. I was upset that I didn’t really know if I was ever going to get it. But then another UPS truck came, and I didn't see it at first, and guess what was in the package? My DS! I didn’t even realize it was finally here until @DATE1. I was so happy that I got it that I forgot to order a game with it. And that was the time I was patient; it was a long wait, but it paid off in the end.
206	18065	7	3	Being patient means waiting calmly, and one of my brothers was a lesson in patience for me. We were there for six hours just to bail out my brother, and we had to go to four different prisons to take my brother out. I was scared but I knew there, if I was patient, everything would come out good. So we were waiting, and we had to bail him out before one o’clock. We were there since early in the morning. My mom was very nervous, pacing back and forth. I told her many times to calm down and that everything was going to be alright. So he and my cousin went in, and we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren’t bailing out at that time and that maybe they would start around a later hour. So we went to get something to eat to pass the time. We went again and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was four o’clock. They gave us something we had to cook, a check or a money order. We went to one different stores and they said we couldn’t cash it. So we went to the Chase bank and we cashed it, and finally, we took out my brother. It was a long day, but our patience paid off in the end.
207	18066	7	3	One day it was a cool new game that came out. It was a kid that had volume one, two, three, and a release date, but they said this is the hot volume. The kid asked his mom for a certain percentage of the cost. His mother said “what for?” The boy said “so I can buy this cool new game.” His mother said “son, your father and I have to pay bills and buy food.” The boy said “okay, I understand,” in a disappointing voice. Later, when the boy’s hard working father walked through the door, the boy said “dad, could I please get some money, so I can buy this game?” The father said “son, I know how much you want this game, but I’m sorry I need to help your mother pay bills.” The boy said “okay I understand.” Then, the boy’s grandmother called and said I need someone to cut my lawn for a certain amount. The boy grinned and said “I’ll be right over there.” The boy mowed the lawn with excitement, thinking of the game. When the boy got the payment, he went right to the game store. When he arrived, the line was several blocks long. His grandmother said “well you gotta have patience.” And he did, as the boy was next in the line. To be continued, his patience was about to be rewarded.
208	18067	7	3	One day we went to the mall: me, Sharae, and Reynal. Me and Reynal wanted to go to one store, but Sharae wanted to go to Pac Sun, so we were patient and let her go to that store first. Then me and Reynal wanted to go to another store, but Sharae wanted to go to a different one, so we were patient and let her go again. Then me and Reynal wanted to go to our chosen store, but Sharae wanted to go to another place until finally we said…ENOUGH! WE ARE GOING TO OUR STORE!!! She said ok, ok, ok but can I just, no. Please, no, please. NO! Alright then, we’ll go to our store, I was just gonna ask to go to the bathroom first. We all took a breath and finally went where we wanted, having practiced patience all afternoon.
209	18068	7	3	Patience is a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient means waiting calmly or being content. A patient; a person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold; I was just nervous. When we arrived at the doctor’s office, which seemed like it was even far away, the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the one o’clock appointment?” “Yes, that’s the one,” said my dad. “Your son looks to be scheduled for a tetanus vaccine,” she said, then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uneasy. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before I knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient, it might’ve hurt more. I learned an important lesson that day about the value of calm waiting.
210	18070	7	3	This story is about Chicken Hound, the fox, and a time he had to be patient. Let me set the scene: the scourge sends Chicken Hound and his mother to be boiled. They were both supposed to be killed and thrown in the ditch. But Chicken Hound had only blacked out. When he awoke he realized his dire situation and knew that he would have to wait until dark to get to safety. He crawled to a wall and waited, although insects had swarmed on him. He remained still, knowing any movement could give away his position. Finally, when the cover of night came, he rolled in the mud to prevent any further blood loss and began his difficult journey. That is when Chicken Hound had to be patient, and his patience ultimately saved his life.
211	18071	7	3	I have used patience many times in my life. I use my patience when waiting on the bus, at home and at school. The first time I remember using patience was when I was fishing one afternoon. I was young at the time, holding my tweety bird fishing pole in one hand and a bag of salt and vinegar chips in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish to bite, I met my friend Bubbles, a Norwegian goose who was also out, maybe a week old at the time. When I met him I fed him some of my bait and I guessed he liked worms, so I gave him all of my bait and put down my pole. And as soon as I grabbed my chips, I had a bite! It turned out to be a very small sunfish. But still to this day I see Bubbles once a year, as he lives near my favorite fishing spot. And this year he had some sidekicks, two ducks I named them Donald and Daisy. They are very friendly and love skittles. Donald is kind of shy around other ducks and Daisy is very content just sitting next to me or on a bench. And Bubbles loves cheese and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm summer grass. And this story is true. The end.
212	18072	7	3	My family and I were going to Florida for spring break one year and I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights until we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early in the morning to drive to the airport. It was about two hours until we got there. Then we checked our bags, went through security, and went to go and find our gate for the plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the uncomfortable airport chairs for a few hours until the plane finally came. Then after we got off that first plane, we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed too! So we had to wait a few hours again, watching the clock, until the second plane came. Then we had to sit through another long plane ride until we finally got to Florida. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there and start our vacation.
213	18073	7	3	"Write in your own way about patience. Bill and his mom are on their way to the amusement park. Bill has been waiting his whole life to go there. Bill’s mom gets a call from his cousins, Jimmy, Bob and Sarah. His cousins ask, ""Can they go?"" Bill’s mom says sure. Bill is a patient boy so he just lets it go, remaining still and patient. Once Bill’s mom gets his cousins, his mom gets another call from his five best friends. They all ask the same question his cousins asked. His mom says yes. They each live in a different place far apart, so it will take twenty minutes to get to each house. They finally get there. Bill is so mad but is still patient, keeping his feelings inside. When his mom gets another call Bill says, ""Who is it now!?!"" It's his dad calling to say, ""I’m at the park with Bill’s brother and sister, where are you?"" Bill’s mom responded, ""I'm pulling in now."" This is my story about patience."
214	18074	7	3	Hi my name is John Smith and I am in school doing the writing test right now as we speak! What do you want to talk about? Well, let's talk about a time I had to be very, very patient. Well, I was going to see Eclipse, the Twilight Saga movie. We got tickets early, about a month early, so I had to be very, very patient. So I waited and waited and time had gone by so slowly. I started to think, what if I stop thinking about it, it might come faster. Well, I asked if I could go to a friend's house and she was going to see the movie too. So the month went by and it came, the night before I get to go and see the movie, and my friend called me. She said she can’t sleep, she’s so excited. I stayed up all night thinking and thinking about what was going to happen in the movie. Well, I didn't know what was going to happen and it drove me crazy not knowing what was going to happen. Well, I finally fell asleep and guess what? I woke up and there were two more hours and I will be getting ready to watch Eclipse and the hours went by and I was ready to go. As soon as I woke up I knew it, it finally came. We were on our way to see it; we got there and we sat down in our seats and watched. The movie was great but it was hard to be patient!! That’s the time I had to be patient.
215	18075	7	3	"Sarah and her twin brother, Alex, waited excitedly in a long line for a concert. Alex hated going places with his sister; she was so weird. ""Sarah,"" Alex whined impatiently. ""What, Alex?"" Sarah asked, taking an earbud out of her ear. ""Why did I have to come?"" Alex asked impatiently. ""Maybe you could learn how to be patient, smart one,"" Sarah said, looking back to see how many people were in line now. Sarah put her earbud back in her ear and blasted ‘The Journey’ by Allstar Weekend. Allstar Weekend was the awesome band they would see in concert. Sarah had always been the patient twin; in fact, that was what everyone called her. Alex was the complete opposite of her, the impatient twin. Sarah almost enjoyed waiting; it made her more excited for things. When the time finally came to see the concert, Sarah was glad she was patient; she was ten times more excited then anyone else there."
216	18076	7	3	There was a time when I was patience and I was waiting for a long time me my cousin, @PERSON1 was walking around town and we was looking for silly bans ok first we went to the @DATE1 store but when we got there they was closed so we started walking again and then we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1 they was on bikes and we walk so then @CAPS1 said itís a @PERSON2 store down there so walk down there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and see how much they casy and they coats @MONEY1 and some of them coat @MONEY2 so we went to @PERSON2 tree and they was a @MONEY3 but we didnít get them because @PERSON1 didnít like the ones they had so we went all over the when we found them she didnít want them. So we went to my grandma house and she asked me where we was all day and I said we was out looking for some dom silly bans. And my grandma said donít go where @PERSON1 want to go. If your mama tell you to come over here come over here and I was trying to be patience by not trying to yell at @LOCATION1. It was a long and tiring day, but I managed to stay calm throughout the entire frustrating search.
217	18077	7	3	Time my friend was patient! one day it was @DATE1@NUM1.and that day was when report cards came out. My grades were good I had @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1, was failing. maths, she had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom see,s it she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tryed to cross it out and put an good grade but she knew her mom will find out. so she told her mom ìreport cards didnít come out yetî. And her mom believed her. So then she tried re printing it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and ìI told her my honest thought and I said @CAPS2î. but ìif you dant wanna get in trouble then yeahî And she said. When her mom asked her ìdid the report cards come outî. She said ìyeahî then her mom found out its not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and  it was a fake grade. Then she got introuble and she was patient about it and she said the truth. Her mom went to the  office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she said the truth. Thatís a time were my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade.She still was honest, and patient about it. I know that it was wrong for me two tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wont get in trouble. In the end, her patience during the confrontation helped her get through a difficult situation.
218	18078	7	3	Have you ever been patient?  I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1ís @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  I planned to got my @CAPS1 washed, deep-condioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. ìIím sorry but @PERSON1 wonít be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that youíd like to do your @CAPS1?í A perplexed expression spread across my face. ì@CAPS3 @CAPS4 here?î I asked. ìyes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three oíclock. ìshe suggested. ìthatís fine.î  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didnít get my @CAPS1 done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has itís advantages. My patience saved me from walking home in the rain with a fresh hairstyle that would have been ruined.
219	18079	7	3	A time when I was patient was at @CAPS1 the largest indoor water park I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. ëí@CAPS2 time @NUM1ííour @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice but it was only @NUM2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, thats not fair I thought to my self but I knew if I wanted to make it to @CAPS1 I had to be patient and wait it out. ëíI have to go to the bathroomíí I said in a moaning vice. ëíwell cant you hold it?íí my mother asked Iím about to explode and your asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myelf. ëíok pull over here, but itís gonna add to to our @CAPS2 time.íí  ëíI @CAPS4ít core!íí I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say ëí@CAPS2 time @NUM3.íí @CAPS6 man that means no more bathroom breaks I m gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. A hour or two went by when I heard the @CAPS3  say ëíarive on destinaton on leftíí  ëí@CAPS8!íí I schreeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1 but then I saw a sign that ëíwater park closed!íí when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said ëísorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow.íí @CAPS9 out it wasínt open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I couldínt we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So at @TIME1 the park was still closed and we were checked out ëíI guess we can stay for the rest of the day. ll go send one more nightíí my dad said. ëí@CAPS8.íí I get to go in the park! And that was the time I was patient. All the waiting and self-control finally paid off when I got to enjoy the water park on our extra day.
220	18080	7	3	I think patience means when your calm and you don't care what somebody @CAPS1 @CAPS2 doing, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of patience @CAPS2 when your mom @CAPS2 shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video game store and you stay there that a good sill of patience a bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you throw a bit of the store, @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when your at @CAPS3 amusement park and theres a @CAPS7 long line And you don't complain that's a very good sign of patience . A bad sign of patience In that situation @CAPS2 that you complian the whole time. . @CAPS6 good sign of patience @CAPS2 when you are waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom and you just wait until she gets out. A bad sign of patience @CAPS2 when you brake down the door and you have to pay for @CAPS9. Asked @CAPS6 good sign of patience. @CAPS2 when your locked out and for go to your friends house. Ultimately, patience is a valuable skill that helps you handle frustrating situations without making them worse.
221	18081	7	3	I was patient when I saw a huge bass jump out from the water at my cottage. I waited calmly, ate my breakfast, and then went fishing. My little brother wanted to go fishing too. So I was patient enough to wait for him to get a new bait, tie it carefully onto his line, and finally come out to the dock. So we get out front and he catches a small bass almost immediately, so I unhooked it gently and brought him over to show mum and dad what he had caught, but little did I realize that a huge @NUM1 pound bass was rooming around out there. So as soon as I got back out there, on my first cast @CAPS1! A huge bass took my bait. At first I thought I had caught a carp because of the heavy pull. but when I saw that @NUM1 pound bass jump with my bait in its mouth I was shaking with excitement! When I showed that fish to my dad he about fainted and the same with me, my mom and my little brother cody. And right now that fish is at the tax adermy being mounted for everyone to see.
222	18082	7	3	One day on my way to school I went to pick up my friend and he told me that he had this new game called Call of Duty World at War. He just kept on talking about it and what he does online with his friends. Then during the last class of the day he sat by me and said I can't wait to go home and play my new game, to which I said cool. Then he started complaining, saying but I have to wait one more hour, which feels so long. I told him just be patient and wait, it will be worth it. Then he said you're right, it’s not like it’s going anywhere, I can play it anytime I want. Then he told me, wanna come over and play after school? Then we both went to his house and played the game for hours, and I told him remember to always be patient till the time is here, because good things come to those who wait.
223	18083	7	3	The one time I was patient was when I was waiting for the new game Killzone @NUM1 to be released. I had to come up with @NUM2 bucks for it, which took some time to save from my allowance. @NUM3 of that was for the game itself and @NUM4 more to put it on hold for me at the local game store. I got it the minute the store had it in the shelves, right on release day. The manager was poking them out of the shipping box so I grabbed one quickly and bought it. I went home, plugged in my PS@NUM1, and started playing online right away. I now have @NUM1,190 hours logged in the game, merged all together from different play sessions. The game is really hard, a day one patch was needed or there was store managers there, one in the back handling the stock. I do not suggest the game for all who are under @NUM6 years old because of its difficulty and intense action.
224	18084	7	3	One day my family and me where going to @PERSON1 to see Jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After me and my brother got home from school we left immediately to go to @LOCATION2. As we where travelling we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the tall buildings there, which was quite a sight. Then we seen a sign that says “you are now leaving @LOCATION3” and another sign that said you are now entering @LOCATION1 and that’s when it happened: the traffic jam. We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1 in the afternoon, how smart was that, not very, but the worst part was the waiting. It lasted for hours just sitting there in the car, but we found ways to amuse ourselves. Like watch the sea @PERSON2’s waves crashing on the shore, and look at the interesting buildings there. That’s my example of patience, waiting calmly during that long, unexpected delay.
225	18086	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the doctor's appointment; I was standing there in the waiting room, calm and quiet, reading a magazine. When the doctor finally called me, I wasn't nervous at all, just ready for my check-up. So when the doctor gave me @NUM1 which, @CAPS1 didn't have at their pharmacy, I was fine with waiting for the prescription to be filled elsewhere. Then, me and my mom went home happy that everything was okay. Got some hwigese on the way and watched @CAPS2 together on the couch. Then, we had some spaghetti for dinner and went to bed early to be ready for school. Then, I had a good day in school in the @NUM2 grade when I was in land. Then, I went home, did my homework, cleaned up the house a bit, watched more of @CAPS2, ate dinner with my family, and then went to bed to get an early start on the next day, feeling content.
226	18087	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday. About a week before my birthday, me and my dad ordered me an American Girl doll. I was super excited because it was my very first doll. The shipping was a problem, though. The week of my birthday arrived, and I kept waiting for the familiar FedEx truck to come down our street. I was disappointed, because they had shipped it from Wisconsin and it usually doesn’t take that long to get there. Another week passed and it still wasn't here. I had to be extra patient, checking the window constantly. I could track it online and see it was in my city, but I still wasn't happy about the delay. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the local post office. Then finally my mom got ahead to ask when they were going to send it out for delivery and the lady at the desk said, “it’s on the way.” A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed with joy when I opened her up. She was perfect, and it was worth the long wait.
227	18088	7	3	Patience, what can I say, I don't have none of it personally. I like things to go quickly and I get frustrated easily. I also don't like it when people do things slow, as it tests my limited patience. This is just a part of who I am, and I find it difficult to change this aspect of my personality.
228	18089	7	3	"Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three hour car ride is a perfect example of patience, exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for the city, I couldn't contain myself. I was already packed up but mom and dad were still standing around. ""Can you please finish packing? I really want to go!"", I exclaimed. ""You'll just have to wait a minute,"" they said. But I couldn't wait, so I grabbed a few more of my things, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they finished packing. After they were done, dad was carrying the last of the bags from their bedroom to the car when he noticed me, sitting patiently on the couch. He thanked me, saying, ""Thank you for being so patient, and just for that, mom and I have a surprise for you."" He set down the suitcases, and briskly walked over to a white plastic bag and suddenly pulled out a rectangular package. It was the newest game in the series I loved so much. ""Thank you so much!"" I replied. This just goes to show that patience really pays off, but only if you don't complain of course."
229	18090	7	3	"The time I was patient was when I was seven years old. When I was seven years old my mom said I had to go to the dentist for a checkup. It was early in the morning so my mom woke me up and I said yes but I was going back to sleep. She said, ""Wake up, its time for you to go to the dentist."" I popped up and started screaming. She was like, ""Be quiet because other people in this house are trying to go to sleep."" I said, ""Ok, mom."" She was like, ""Go grab you some clothes."" I said, ""Ok."" So when we had both put on some clothes, I was just saying stuff. I was like, ""I'm going to the dentist to get some stickers,"" and I just kept saying that to calm myself down. When she pulled up in the parking lot, I stopped and said, ""We're here."" Then she parked the car and I opened the door. My mom signed us in and then we sat down. It was a lot of people there, so when we sat down, fifteen minutes later they called us. I was about to yell but then they came. The dentist lady took me to the room and told me to lift my head up so she could put the bib on me. Then the main doctor came in. He was like, ""We are about to clean your teeth."" I was crying cause I thought it was gonna hurt, so I was crying and talking about how it was gonna hurt. They put the tool on my teeth and they said, ""See, it doesn't hurt."" Then they were done ten minutes later. The female lady dentist was like, ""You can pick three stickers."" I was so happy because I finally got some stickers. When we left, we got in the car and then I went to sleep. That was the day I learned to be patient."
230	18091	7	3	One day I had to be patient. It all started when I raked some leaves for my neighbor, and I was going to get paid for my work. I was so excited to receive the money. Well, I was going to get it the day after, but I wanted it that very second. I had to keep reminding myself to wait calmly. Ultimately, I learned that being patient was necessary, even though it was difficult at the time.
231	18092	7	3	One of my stories of being patient is this one time at my uncle's house, and I wanted to play the toy boy. Well, there were like five other kids too, and I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited quietly, like for an hour or two at least it felt like it, and I didn’t say a word about it the whole time. I just watched the other kids take their turns, trying to keep my mind off the wait. Then I finally got to play, which felt like a great reward for all that quiet waiting. That’s my story about being patient.
232	18093	7	3	I was panicking when I was about to have an allergy shot; I sat and waited for two hours. I had played my Nintendo DS for an hour, then I watched TV I had gotten before, so I started to pace. My parents had to stop me from leaving six times; I almost left the floor the sixth time. Then it came time for me to go down to the allergy room. It was a fight because I wanted to walk and they said no, but they won. Then after the allergy shot, I had to lay flat for six hours, which felt incredibly long and boring. Then I got to go home, finally feeling relieved it was all over.
233	18094	7	3	Two years ago our immigration limit had run out. We needed green cards to become permanent residents. So we went to an immigration center in Detroit. We walked up to the front desk and told the lady we were here. She told us to go sit in the waiting area. There was about fifty people there! I knew we were going to be here a while from that point forward. We went to the waiting area, and I had no way of amusing myself. It strictly said in the front, no gaming devices, no musical devices. All phones must be switched off. It was torture, just sitting there watching the clock. After about an hour and a half they finally called our name. I was so pleased to get moving. After we got our fingerprints and everything completed and we walked out to the car, my mom said she was very pleased with the way I behaved in that office, which made the long wait feel worthwhile.
234	18095	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I used to be able to wait for anything. One time I was so patient I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow, and she got the game the day I asked her. At one time I thought I was the most patient person in my whole family. I am so patient I can wait a month just before I go to Cedar Point. You have to be born with patience. Some of my friends are patient but they can’t wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them what I say to everybody who asked me about being patient: you have to be born with patience. It’s not something you learn over the years. I could wait three weeks without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older their patience grows lesser. That doesn’t work on everybody. But sometime soon I know my patience will be like everyone else's when I get older. Who knows, maybe somebody might be more patient than me in the world, but for now, I am content with my ability to wait.
235	18096	7	3	I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience I’ve had was hunting. You just have to sit there, not talk, and stay completely still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle John and we got out there at six o'clock am and then waited there until nine o’clock at night. The deer finally started to come in and one deer got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn’t even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the deer running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that night we went home really hungry and a little disappointed, but that's just how hunting sometimes goes.
236	18097	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when I ordered a new video game in the mail. It was a cool autumn evening, and I was ordering the game online. When I got to the shipping options, I paid for it and went to the check-out screen. I saw the estimated delivery time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said three weeks. ""Three weeks?!"" I exclaimed. ""That’s a long time."" But it was decided. I had to make it through those three weeks. I was ready. And so I waited. I checked the mailbox every afternoon, and waited some more. Until one Tuesday I saw a cardboard package. The address said “Current Resident”! My heart sank, but the next day, a smaller, flatter package arrived. The address said “Jane Doe”! I was so happy! I ripped it open right there. This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, you’ll get what you're wanting in the end."
237	18098	7	3	That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Let's go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heaven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to Florida. This was my dad's mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the five children. When we finally took off we were in turbulence the whole two-hour flight. Which meant we couldn’t get up, get food, use the restroom and also had that queasy feeling in your stomach. It was the worst flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take two stops till we got to Florida. Then another forty-five minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a precious memory I will never forget. The stubborn little smirk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her, “chicken little.” Hearing her say it one last time is a sound I will always carry with me.
238	18099	7	3	“Me! Me! Me!” Sarah said, “I wanna go first!” All the time in cheerleading this girl named Sarah thought she was the first to do everything. Oh yeah my name is Emily. I’m always a flier along with Sarah. I’m always patient and wait my turn because I don't wanna complain or be a poor sport. “Ready set! One, two, down, up, three, four, five, six!” the two bases and backspots yell. They pop the flier out and up then scream “Got her!” “Good job,” Coach says. “Okay, it’s my turn, Emily, you can do this you're better then her,” I thought to myself. “Okay we can do this,” one of our bases, Jessica, said. I get ready. Hand on shoulders, prepared to get popped up into the air. Our other base, Mark, says “One, two, down, up! Okay, three, four, five, six—Got her!” “Great job Emily!” the team cheers but loses the competition. I was so excited, I just did a pop ride without messing up my landing. I thought with excitement. Being patient might be rewarding after all. From that day on I’ve always tried to be patient. It can really help you out so you know what you have to work on or work less on, allowing you to perform your best when the moment finally arrives.
239	18100	7	3	Are you good with being patient? Sometimes I am but sometimes I’m not. I’m going to tell you a story when I was patient when I’m normally not patient in situations like this. I had gone to school with my mom so she could take a test and then drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting I was texting and on the internet, but then my stomach started to rumble, I was really hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I could get something to eat. As I was texting I stopped and thought about what I was about to do. I knew how hard and how long she had studied for that test. I didn't want her to get a bad grade so I just sat there patiently. I texted other people. People called me so my mind was off the food. After my mom finished her test she came out of the room. I asked her “How did it go?” She looked at me, smiled and said “I felt confident, but now I’m hungry.” I shouted out “me too!” We got in the car and went to Subway. I had got the footlong meal with cookies, chips, and a drink; it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall and I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. Then we went to H&M, Charlotte Russe, Forever 21, and other places as well. After I thought about it I never want to do that again. I was starving and my butt started to hurt from sitting. I sat there for two hours with nothing to do and decided never again will I do that. At least I had some bonding time with my mom, and that’s one bright side to the whole long, patient wait.
240	18102	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at school waiting for the final bell. I was waiting for my science teacher to call on me to get ready to go. I was sitting down in my seat, my backpack already packed and resting at my feet. She was calling people one by one to stand by the door to get ready to go to their next class. The clock seemed to move slower with each passing minute. I watched as my classmates were called, their names echoing in the quiet room. I resisted the urge to fidget or get up, knowing I had to wait for my turn. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I heard my name. I stood up, grabbed my bag, and walked calmly to the door, feeling a quiet sense of accomplishment for having waited so patiently without complaint.
241	18103	7	3	Patient @PERSON2, when is our food going to be here? (said @PERSON1) You have to be patient, said @PERSON2, while in so @CAPS1, said @PERSON1. Well you will have to wait, unit ok; @CAPS2 hears your food (yes @PERSON1 shouts patience is all ways the key! @PERSON2 I’m done ending lets go said hides hold on how do I finish my food hurry patience, fine) I’m done. Wow that was quick. @CAPS3 patience is the way. You ready yup, off we go, Success lala- whait you posted it and @PERSON1 all right btd an, @CAPS3 hurry patience, @CAPS3 said @PERSON1, fine I’ll just go slower and @PERSON2, @CAPS4 I’ll have patience. Where here in @NUM1 min. this is a good new that was a good right I @CAPS3 right I’m dad you have @CAPS3 now and soo thanks. Hay @PERSON2 look at that dump talking down strands us, where @PERSON2 replied the @NUM2 story building @CAPS4 wach out said @PERSON2, patience @PERSON1 said, you don’t need patience yes I do just i.k I tol—Splat @CAPS3 if only I wasn’t a patient..
242	18105	7	3	Have you ever had to wait in a @NUM1 hour line? This is what it was like for me and @CAPS1. We were at Cedar Point waiting to ride the Top Thrill Dragster. We had just got there and the first thing we decided to do was ride the Top Thrill Dragster but the line was about a three hour wait we went anyway. We had just finished our first hour of waiting but it felt like three. I knew I had to be patient and relax but it just felt like forever. After another hour my stomach started to growl I checked my watch it was @NUM2 we had got here at @NUM3 I was starving and tired but I stayed patient. Finally an hour later it was our turn when I got off I knew it had been worth it to be patient. In conclusion I learned that patience is something you have to have for a lot of things in life.
243	18106	7	3	"Don't you ever wish everyone in the world would be patient, @CAPS4 if you don't I do. Lucky for me one time I was a not so good girl and I did something I was not supposed to do, but since I have such great parents they were trying their best to be patient with me, like all parents they had to give me a lecture about what I did, but they did not let me get out of the hook that easy. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 please come down to the office"" I heard on the announcement, @CAPS6 I was walking down the hallway I was really nervous ""what have I done"" I asked myself, I was thinking really hard. By no time I was at the office ""yes"" I said to the person that was there ""Do you know why you're here"" @CAPS3 said ""no"" I replayed. ""@CAPS4 I been having some complaints from these girls"" @CAPS3 had told me ""@CAPS4 oh ya"" I said ""@CAPS4 ya what"" @CAPS3 said ""was the only reason why I was being mean was because they were being mean and they were being such suck ups they would tell my friends that the only reason I hanged out with them was because they had money which was not true"" I said ""ok I get where your coming from, let me call them down"" @CAPS3 said. ""@CAPS5 and Alesay come down to the office please."" @CAPS6 they came down the hallway I could hear their foot steps. I really did not want to talk to them to be continued."
244	18107	7	3	One thing I am not very patient with is the MEAP. The reason I am not patient with the MEAP is because it is very boring, you can not talk and it is dull. I hate the MEAP it is very difficult, you don’t see ten see or @CAPS1 doing the MEAP. The MEAP expects you to do too much work the MEAP is one of the reason I dislike Michigan. The MEAP asks you questions and words you never saw or heard before. In my opinion @CAPS2 we are going to do MEAP I would prefer them to ask questions and words that we know. Another thing I don’t like about it is that they grade our writing on opinion they grade off of what they think of it. To me the MEAP is stupid @CAPS2 I had a choice I would choose not to do it. Since the MEAP is important I do it for my grade. These are the reasons why I am very inpatient with the MEAP.
245	18108	7	3	When I was little I was patient I would always sit and wait for direction my mom always liked it that way @CAPS5 now since @CAPS1 bigger she thinks @CAPS1 is impatient @CAPS5 your what @CAPS1 not I am patient I get along I am not antsy I m not the type when they say (when are we going you guys) That is I when was @CAPS4 learning how to speak @CAPS5 I guess that is how it goes and @TIME1 I was patient because my mom and dad were having a talk and I was not about to hear it it was grown-up talk.
246	18109	7	3	My mom is very patient because I use her phone a lot to text my girlfriend and to call and text my friends. She tells me when I get a text or a call, but she also lets me know when she needs to use it herself, and I have to hand it over. It must be difficult for her to always share her phone, but she never gets overly upset about it. She understands that communicating with my friends is important to me, and for that, I am very grateful. Her patience in this situation teaches me a lot about sharing and consideration for others, even when it might be an inconvenience.
247	18110	7	3	A time when I was patient was for my birthday. My mom told me she was getting me a specific gaming console for my birthday, and I was so happy. Then when my birthday came and I was opening my presents, there was no console. So I asked her about it, and she said she would get it later in the year when the tax refund came, so I had to be patient and wait for several months and a couple of days. I was mad because I thought she had it already. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until that date finally arrived. It seemed like the days got longer and longer. I was getting more and more frustrated; that was the longest few months ever. I didn't even know it could feel so long; I thought a year had gone by. After more time went by, it was finally the day, but I didn't get it until the very end of the month, which just crushed my little heart so badly, to wait for something that long that I wanted so desperately. When I finally got it, it was so fun to play with all the games and apps; the experience was amazing. If something were to happen to it, I would be completely destroyed. A console like that is expensive, but once you get it, you have to take care of it. That's why I keep it in a special place away from little kids. I don't even let them play with it at all, and if I feel they might be able to, it is only with my direct supervision. That thing cost too much money to get lost or broken, especially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting something like it, but it's some kind of educational one. My little brother is getting a different handheld console. I'm happy they are getting something so they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some new games for it for my upcoming birthday; I had one before, but my little brother or sister lost it, and I was so angry about how they can't be careful with things at all. That was definitely something that taught me to wait and be patient. That's why I am so careful with it now, because I'm scared of it getting lost or broken. If it does, my mom won't get another one, and I understand why.
248	18112	7	3	"The first time I babysat was with two little girls, a toddler and a baby. A toddler named Lily and a baby named Chloe. After their parents left, everything was fine for a little while. That is, until the baby, Chloe, started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, ""Cookie, cookie!"" but then I realized she was saying, ""Cooky, Cooky!"" Her ""Cooky"" is her special blanket, and when I finally handed it to her, she stopped crying immediately! Now I realize how patient I was with her, trying to figure out what was wrong instead of getting flustered. I’m glad I stayed calm and figured out what she wanted so I could comfort her. Hopefully, next time I babysit, I’ll be just as patient and understanding."
249	18114	7	3	When I had to be patient, one of my most memorable times was when I ordered my first electric guitar. I ordered my guitar from a reputable guitar website that my guitar teacher recommended. I waited and I waited until finally, the package arrived. I took the guitar out of the box and immediately saw that it was chipped. I was extremely angry and disappointed. We sent the guitar back for a replacement. After some time, I got another guitar, so I opened it up, hopeful again. It was the same damaged guitar I had sent back; I was even more angry than before. So again, we sent the guitar back, hoping that we would finally get the right, undamaged one. It felt like it took forever, but eventually, a new package arrived. I was so happy, and this time I was not angry; the guitar was perfect. I was so happy when my guitar finally came, and it arrived just in time for my birthday, which made it an even better present.
250	18115	7	3	Patience is a special skill for some people, and for others, it is very hard to learn. When I was a little girl, I never had any patience, and even now, I do not have much of it either. But my friend was always patient with me. Sure, she would tell me to hurry up or that she would leave, but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me while I picked up a stray cat and helped me take it to the pound; that's what she would always do for me. Patience is something I will probably never learn until I am much older, but I know I will learn it someday. One time, my friend waited for two hours just to learn about history for a project; I would have never had the patience for that. But then again, she did get a perfect score on her history homework, so her patience for that task was really cool, and she told me that patience is a number one priority for success. This was one time my friend truly demonstrated her patience.
251	18116	7	3	It was a bright sunny day and there was a long, slow-moving line outside the airport terminal. People were waiting for their flight to @LOCATION1. It has been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, shuffling and sighing, but there was a young little boy in the group that didn’t seem to complain; he was very patient, quietly reading a book. Now it has to be five hours, their flight has been delayed, the sun went down, casting long shadows, and there was a riot going on with angry shouts, but still the little young boy was still waiting patiently, observing the scene calmly. It has now been twelve hours, people began to leave, grumbling in frustration, it was midnight, cold and dark, and yet the boy was still waiting there and has not yet moved from his spot. Now there was only fifteen people left, it was dawn, the sky lightening, and yet the boy waited there patiently, his small bag beside him. Their flight has finally arrived and only there was three people there, including the boy and two girls. They went in the plane, exhausted but relieved. The other people that left saw the plane ready to take off and ran toward it, waving their arms. But they were too late and the only people who made it to @LOCATION1 was the two girls and the patient boy. The end.
252	18117	7	3	Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail can feel endless. A time when I had to use patience was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then they might put it in the book, which was very exciting. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could, thinking of the perfect words, and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines, which felt a bit short. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem, hoping for the best. It said on their website that the letter will arrive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time, checking the mailbox every afternoon. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond, which was a surprise. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience, which was true, and that was the lesson I learned from the whole experience.
253	18118	7	3	This was one day when I had to do something that I didn’t want to do and if I didn’t do it I couldn’t go no were or go to the movies, which was my mother's rule. When I was at my aunt house and I had to clean up her house and I didn’t want to do it so she had told me that her house should be clean when she come back home and I was the only one there, feeling quite alone. When I went to @CAPS1 point everybody went on this scary high in the sky ride and you have to take your shoes off, which was nerve-wracking, than we got something to eat at a small stand. The next day when everybody wolk up we heat from the hotel and went home an ate breakfast an than I didn’t won’t to ride my uncle four wheeler down the hill but he had started it up an push it but I had on knee pads and elbow pads and gloves, so I felt a bit safer. When I got to my grandma house, I didn’t know that every body was help but I dint want to but my mum made me help so nobody went outside to play football; it was a good game cause I look out the window the whole game, I didn’t patient cause I wasn’t in it, just watching. Wow a was watching the football game out the window the other childs run out the door an I was not done with the wall, so I had to stay inside and finish my chores, learning about patience the hard way.
254	18119	7	3	The time that I was patient was today when everyone was taking the @CAPS1.E.A.P., a big state test. When we all get into the classroom nobody what so ever did not want to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P, when our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, nobody wanted to, and there were many groans. So when we got the packet that we had to bubble in our answers we had to fill something out on the front of the packet, which took a few minutes. Then we had to put our first and last name on it before we could take a short break. When the break was over we needed to get a free reading book and our teacher had to read all of us the directions to us we got started and when everyone was finished she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break, when everyone went she read the directions to the other part and when everyone was doing that same people got done really early and they got really board and they didn’t want to read so then they all started to talk; she said she would be right back that she had to go to the bathroom so once someone else came in and would watch us then all of the guys would make paper basket balls and started to shot them into the tiny basket ball hoop and then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we would be starting the last writing session and that after this it would be lunch and it might even go though our lunch and then everyone was freaking out, worried about missing their meal. So that was the time that I was just patient, sitting quietly and waiting for the whole long process to finally be over.
255	18120	7	3	One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first nascar race, which was incredibly loud and crowded. I had to be patient because there wer a lot of people there and I didn`t want to get last in line for the entrance. An I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats, which took a very long time. Second, we finally got our seats an I had to sit by this scary person; he was weird and talked to himself, so I tried to ignore him. So the race was beginning an you could tell because the racers were getting into there cars, revving their powerful engines. The jets went over us in a loud roar and the @ORGANIZATION1 was going, playing the national anthem. Then the racers were off to race, a blur of colors. Finally the race a starts on my favorite racer is in the lead (@PERSON1), which made me cheer. The cars were going so fast around the track like you could feel the bleachers shake with every lap. It was a fun exsperense but you had stay close is listen and be patient throughout the entire long, noisy event, and it was worth it in the end.
256	18121	7	3	I am never patient, but on the rare occasions when I am, it is only once in a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet, I get really bad headaches. In school, for example, when I’m waiting, I get really fidgety, like I tap my foot and tap my pencil on my desk. I tap everything; things like that are a constant need. I absolutely must do something or I will go insane. Waiting in a doctor's office, or flying on a plane for a while, can get real boring. When I wait too long, I start to feel lazy and tired because I’m not moving at all. I get buggy when I’m patient and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than thirty minutes before I get real bad. I can’t be patient very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is by playing sports and doing things constantly to keep my mind and body occupied, which is a necessary strategy for me.
257	18123	7	3	Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait and make good decisions. For me, patience is the ability to stay calm and collected when faced with a delay or a problem. Patience is very important because it allows me to rationally deal with situations so that I will not get into trouble. However, maintaining patience in times of stress is difficult. It is difficult because people are giving you grief and pressure from all sides. Without sufficient patience, people make bad decisions, and this leads to bad things happening. Patience lets me deal with bad ideas like impulsive reactions. By using patience, I can carefully deal with the problem at hand and then move on, as rash actions are a very bad idea that can complicate matters further.
258	18124	7	3	It was the night before Christmas Eve and I could hardly wait. In my family on Christmas Eve we go to my grandparents' house. When we are there we talk, eat, and my favorite, open presents. As my mom, dad, and I drove up to my grandparents' house I couldn’t open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the doorbell a hundred times in my excitement. “Well hello there, sport,” my grandpa said. “Hey, can we eat fast so I can open my presents?” I asked eagerly. “Yeah, sure,” he replied with a laugh. After we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I simply could not wait any longer. As I waited patiently until all of my older relatives opened their presents, it was finally my turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was: a new video game. Since it was the first present, I had to open it fast, but from then on I waited patiently until it was my turn again for the next gift, learning to contain my excitement a little better.
259	18126	7	3	I saw someone demonstrate real patience once at a fast food restaurant. They got to the restaurant before I did, and then I ordered my food and it came out quickly. They, however, still had no food, so I left after finishing my meal. They finally got their food long after I was gone; now that’s what I call having patience, to wait so long without complaint while others are served before you. It was a clear example of composure I rarely possess.
260	18127	7	3	When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the Tigers. We were playing against the Lions for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hardest working player on my team, and he wanted to save me. Without me playing, my team was down by ten points and my coach didn’t put me in yet. I knew if I stayed calm and was patient, my chance would come and he would let me play. So when it was the fourth quarter with a minute left in the game and we were down by five, my coach finally told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was thirty seconds left; I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was ten seconds left and we were down by one point, I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot, which is when you are at the foul line and it’s just you, the ball, and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem, but my second shot I didn’t know what to do, so I thought about what I did to play in the game: patience. So as I got ready to shoot, I got patient with the shot to think it out, and when I shot it, I made it. Once the other team got the ball to inbound it, we stole the ball and won the game. If I hadn’t been patient in this game we wouldn’t have won, and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me, proving that patience truly is a virtue.
261	18128	7	3	My mom has very little patience, which is why it surprised me when she had a whole bunch the day my grandma passed away. I was amazed she was sad but took her time carefully and slowly, as if every move she made had to be perfect and deliberate. It was a terrible day, and all any of us wanted to do was cry and grieve. My mom knew that my grandma would want her to be happy and strong, that’s why she watched her every move and held herself together. As soon as I got there she came right up to me and gave me a huge, comforting hug, and no matter what my little brother and I did, she didn’t even mind or raise her voice. That was a very surprising day because I had never in my life seen her that sad but yet so patient and composed throughout it all.
262	18129	7	3	A time that I was patient is when I had my twelfth birthday party. All of my friends except one wanted to keep playing the games we had started, so we did. We decided to go and walk the dogs first, and then have a nice dinner together, and then finally open the presents. When we were all done with that, we opened my presents, and I was very excited and happy to see them all. That is a time that I was patient, waiting for my favorite part of the day. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first without complaining. Plus in the end, I got a lot of exciting stuff, and I realized that waiting, and doing what my friends wanted to do first, was a great idea that made the whole day more fun. I’m pretty sure that we all had a great time together because of it.
263	18130	7	3	Sarah was swinging with her friend all day when she was swinging so high that the chain came loose and Sarah fell, and she was screaming in pain. So they walked into the house to get help. When they got to the house Sarah was still screaming and crying, so they all got in the car and drove to the doctor's office. The nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor, which felt like forever. Sarah wasn’t patient at first, fidgeting and upset, until she and her friend were talking and distracting each other with stories. When the doctor was finally ready to see her, she had forgot all about why she was there because of their conversation. Sarah found out that she broke her arm and needed a cast. Later that day she thanked her mom for taking her and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient during the long, scary wait.
264	18131	7	3	I thought that when I got hurt during football and was on a stretcher, everyone around me was incredibly patient. They understood that I could only go a certain speed and waited for me in the hallways and carried my stuff from room to room without a single complaint. An example of someone showing this patience was my friend Mark, who had to hurry to go to the bathroom but walked with me slowly so I wouldn't be alone and in pain. Another example of someone being patient with me is my sister Lauren. Lauren was patient with me when I asked her repeatedly for help with my homework, even though she was busy with her own work, and she never once made me feel like a burden. Their kindness during that difficult time is something I will always remember and appreciate.
265	18132	7	3	The time I was patient was when my mom and I went to the eye doctor. It was my first time going there, so I was nervous. We went to this lady at the front desk and had to wait for the doctor to call us. We sat for twenty minutes and then we heard the doctor calling my name. We went inside the doctor's room and I sat down in the big chair; he does all these tests and things with different machines. Later he tells us that we have to meet one more doctor for another part of the exam. We sat down again in the waiting room and we waited some more. Then we hear my name again so we go into another room. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine bottle on the table and I was really scared of what it was for. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide, which was difficult because I was so nervous. After that she took the medicine and was going to put it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she put the medicine in my eyes it burned a little and I flinched. I didn't want her to do the other eye at all. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I couldn't; I had to be patient. She did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back she told me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, as we were leaving, that it wasn’t so bad after all and I was glad I had stayed still.
266	18133	7	3	I forgot to grab my helmet and knee pads out of my mom’s car because she works until five and at six that evening my skateboarding session was supposed to begin. I felt a surge of frustration, knowing I couldn't practice without my gear. Then my patience showed up, reminding me that a short delay wouldn't ruin the entire day and that I could find another activity to enjoy in the meantime.
267	18134	7	3	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you shouldn’t get mad, but instead give them the benefit of the doubt. You can also be patient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered, you should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.
268	18135	7	3	Patient, that’s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast, it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite, then you have to wait for the fish to swallow the hook. Sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because you have to consider the water color, the amount of weeds, and what the fish are eating that day. Then you have to have patience on the spot you are at too, because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back to the area. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing, but the reward of a catch makes it all worthwhile.
269	18136	7	3	Anna sat there waiting patiently, come on come on come on! She thought to herself at the meet, and was very excited to perform her now improved beam routine. Anna was one of the last gymnasts to go, only making her situation more difficult as she watched the others take their turns. She took a deep breath, and sat down patiently, waiting for her chance to shine for the judges and finally show them all the hard work she had put into her practice.
270	18137	7	3	It was the fifteenth of October when I went to see the Creed concert with my cousins. There must have been a hundred or two hundred people in front of us in the long, winding line. Then I heard and saw people shoving and pushing to get in, which made the wait feel even longer. About thirty to forty minutes later my legs started aching from standing for so long, but I held on. I kept telling myself, “the pain is worth the wait!” Finally we got to the security guards and they had to do a metal detector check on us. When we walked into the concert venue and the music hit us, I said, “that was a wait worth waiting for.”
271	18138	7	3	"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago my mom said her sister was coming. My grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is one hundred dollar. That was a lot of money. She couldn't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. So she was suppose to be coming on Friday. She didn't come. I was sick so I called my mom at her job. I said, ""Mom why didn't auntie come."" My mom said,"" Honey she is coming you just have to be patient."" Okay, I said. Next day was Saturday. ""Mom is she here yet"" I said. ""No, honey be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""Okay, I understand."" I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So my mom called my godmom. She said it was okay. So she told me she was going to McDonald's. I love McDonald's. I so good. I asked my mom. ""Can I have a cheeseburger. McDonald's cheese burger."" I said hello to my uncle and my mom said she was not coming. I told my mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. My mom said to my uncle John ""should I get her something to eat. I thought she ment my grandmother. So I thought for a while her who is her. So I called back my mom said ohh I get food for uncle John's dog. I said, Spot's? For a dog? She said know dog food. So my mom got me from my god mothers house I could not walk because my legs, back, arm and every part that I could move on my body hurt. So my grandmother came to her house because we have a keys. So she said where is she? My uncle whispered something and I said she here! Ran in my uncle room and hug her I said how are you because when I went for my grandmother birthday. She live in south caroline so yeah. The is my writing. That is when I was patient. So I could wait for my mom's sister."
272	18140	7	3	Two years ago, when the first iPhone came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it, showing off its features every chance he got. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his phone, worrying she might damage his new prized possession. So she was phoneless for aleast three months, which felt like a very long time. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it, finally getting a phone of her own. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first iPhone and a webcom, which made her feel it was worth the long wait. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldnít be able to wait that long without complaining much more.
273	18141	7	3	When I was about seven I wanted one thing in the wold. You know how some girl would want a baby ball no not me I wanít a rex this toy was the bigest and the meanest dinow on the plant well when I was a little it was. It was so cool to me ti could walk, talk it can run he can bit, and it had big, sharp teeth. Ever time I go to the story I would go to the toy part of the story, and find that rex and look at it in the eyes in say ìyou will be mine one day.î You know how relly wanít somthing and mom says chismist is coming up. When it anít comeing in till two months. But I wonít it now not in two months. So I thought what can I do to get the rex befor two months? I got it! I will clen up more, walk the bog more, do better in school, and hopefully that will work. So I ask my mom ìmom if I start doing all this good stof can I get so of my chismast thing in a week earlyî she said ìno you just get more thing on chismisî I was so mad I was about to cry, my plan had failed. But two month was not that long. I was opening my gifts in no time. but I thought that I open all my gifts, I look arond one good time I did! But I donít see the rex I was said even thow I had like ten or more gifts, I still felt disappointed. I still donít have that rex. So I sidely walk to my room, my shoulders slumped. My mom came in my room with a big box. Could it be! I jumped out of my bed so fast my mono donít see me. I looked in the box it was a lot of babys doll, which made my heart sink. Then she said go down stars and ther he was rex looking so happy to see me, finally mine after all that waiting.
274	18142	7	3	ìFive, six, seven, eight!î my poms coach Ms. Smith says as we practice the dance over and over again until our moves are perfect. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring, especially when we have to hold our arms up high for a long time. We have practice Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We also have six girls including me, so we are a small team. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves to make sure we all know the steps. On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day, talking about it nonstop. But the game was at 5:45 pm and they didnít even start until 6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over an hour until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the fourth quarter and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch and get ready. We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didnít get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side of the field. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to ten then quickely we only had five seconds until we went on. I couldnít believe it, only five seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced ìLincoln Elementary performing their junior varsity pom pon teamî then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field, a loud and wonderful sound. We quickley all reminded our self to smile big for everyone watching. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents for their support. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family, all giving us hugs and congratulations. And waiting and being patient wasnít so bad anymore. It was all worth the wait in the end.
275	18143	7	3	When dealing with todlers or the elderly you must have patience. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more of it. Elderly often may become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you are. You must practice patience and give them respect, never rushing them or speaking harshly. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning about the world. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, which only makes things worse. Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons, as they face different hurdles. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it, so kindness is essential. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers, and they need calm explanations. Be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks may be hard for them to complete quickly or at all. Be patient with everyone because patience is a form of respect you show them. Fear is not respect, only patience and understanding are. That is how I feel about the word patience and its importance in our lives.
276	18144	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was babysitting were acting up. It was hard for me to get them to calm down. But, I noticed that if I was patient then they would be too. So, I just sat down and told them calmly to settle down, but they wouldn't listen. So I told them again in a quiet, steady voice and this time they were a bit quieter. I noticed that if I ignored their tantrums or remained patient then they would eventually settle down and stop, because I realized they were just trying to get my attention. If I was being patient and calm, I knew they would eventually mirror that behavior. It worked; they settled down and were being a lot more cooperative when I was babysitting them the next time too, which showed me the true value of maintaining composure.
277	18146	7	3	"""Pull back harder on the reins!"" my teacher yelled. ""I'm trying, but he's just not listening!"" This horse had to be the most stubborn horse I had ever ridden in my life! He did whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, and paid no attention to me at all. ""Okay, just bring him in,"" she said. I slowly walked the horse into the center of the ring. ""I really am trying; he's just not listening,"" I said in frustration. ""I know he can be a bit hard-headed, but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him,"" she replied. The horse's name was Rusty, and he was a reddish-brownish color with big glassy brown eyes. He looked like a great horse that listened to its rider. Wrong! He was not nice or sweet and didn't listen at all! ""Now walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter,"" my instructor said. ""Okay, fine,"" I replied. But as I was halfway around the ring, Rusty stopped. Then he turned to his right, walked up to the window, and started licking the water that beaded up on it. ""What is he doing!"" she yelled. ""I think he is licking the water off the windows,"" I said. ""Well, get him away from there; he could get sick!"" As I said earlier, this horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! ""You need to be patient,"" my instructor told me. I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed my shoulders a little and continued riding with no further problems for the rest of the lesson. I guess I truly needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse ever again."
278	18147	7	3	"On my way to the coast to visit my dad, I prepared for the long drive. While in the car there is food, and I brought along my Nintendo Switch to keep me busy. I brought my Switch along because it would be annoying if I asked ""are we there yet?"" very five minutes, and I knew that a five-hour drive would need some entertainment. Most of the time I would be playing games so time goes by fast; if I don't play games then I eat a snack, play with my baby cousin, Lily, and sometimes just sleep. After a while of that, I sit back and relax, watching the scenery go by. The whole trip is five hours, but by doing all that it seems to be more like two or three hours, making the journey feel much shorter and more enjoyable."
279	18148	7	3	"Patience is basically waiting and tolerating it. Every year on May first, my family becomes seasonal at a campground. There we play and have fun and make many lifelong friends. Every weekend we go out there and we take our speed boat, ""The Glass Frog."" We put it into the lake and dock it at a dock. Then we go fishing on every part of the lake and sit there for six hours. This is where patience comes in; we have to sit and watch our bobbers float on the smooth, glass-like lake. We sit there and watch and talk and bake in the sunlight. It is quite peaceful though, that I'm off school and I get to spend quality time with my parents. Then in school I have to wait patiently throughout the year so the year can be over. So we sit there quietly until the sudden noise of one of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that there's some yelling and ""get the net"" sayings. The funny part is that it is either a large bass or a small sunfish. And all this takes a great deal of patience, which is a valuable lesson learned."
280	18149	7	3	My dog, Teddy Bear, is very impatient because when he comes in from outside he gets a treat, but he has to wait for the other dogs to come in. He will sit by the treat jar, whining and pacing back and forth, staring intently at the door until his siblings finally come inside. His little tail wags furiously the moment the last dog enters, knowing his wait is finally over and his reward is coming. This small, daily routine perfectly illustrates his impatient but hopeful nature.
281	18150	7	3	One afternoon in early spring I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby JACKSON. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, brother and I, in the waiting room lobby. The chairs were stiff and uncomfortable, adding to the long stretch of time. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting, a duration that felt much longer in the quiet, sterile hallway. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around a small circle to stretch my legs. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy, my excitement barely contained. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before rushed to the time I was being patient, which only amplified my restless energy as we awaited the wonderful news.
282	18151	7	3	Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. I’ve been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block, a small convenience shop that was always busy. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block, snaking out the door and along the sidewalk. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line, settling in for a long wait. A half hour past and it was five minutes til’ closing time, the line inching forward slowly. I get to the window and pay for my things one minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing, just watching the world go by. The owner of the store, seeing my perseverance, let me get a total of five things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things, a pleasant and unexpected surprise. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures, both big and small. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind, and you may find yourself rewarded in the most unexpected ways.
283	18152	7	3	Well you need patience when your fishing, waiting quietly for a bite that may not come for hours, and whe your food is comeing or going to be served to you, resisting the urge to complain about the delay, but also be patient with everybody else, understanding that they too are dealing with their own struggles and timelines. Practicing this virtue in all aspects of life makes for a more peaceful and harmonious existence for yourself and for those around you.
284	18153	7	3	Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “What’s that?” I asked through my squeaky seven-year-old voice. My dad responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where Elvis’s playing.” “Wouldn’t it be cool if we could go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of AUBURN. It was huge, towering over us with bright lights! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my dad kept telling me we had to wait for the right time to go in. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “Dad, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again, growing more desperate. Finally, my dad took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside, with a grand staircase and glittering chandeliers! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “Could my son use the bathrooms?” my dad asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “no” and we were forced to return back to the car, my hopes dashed. Another fifteen minutes passed, each one feeling like an hour. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost twenty minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom and could then fully enjoy the spectacular show.
285	18154	7	3	I was patient when I went to Disneyland on Monday. First it started out when I got a call from my friend Michael he asked me to go. So I said yes, feeling a surge of excitement. I had to be patient all day until the following Saturday, counting down the days. Then he drove the long way but I was patient, looking out the window at the passing scenery without complaint. When we got to the entrance I felt good for being patient, knowing my calm demeanor had made the long journey more pleasant for everyone, and that my reward was just beyond the gates.
286	18156	7	3	"Once upon a time there was a place called Unpaciente Land. But on Grumpy Lane lived a little girl named @ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever, known for her calm and steady nature. One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut at ""Mtso Fast Saloon!"" When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 the hair cutter, creating a loud and chaotic scene, and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said, ""Hey, if you want your hair to look good, sit down and be quiet,"" and everybody did, settling down immediately. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut, just like everybody else who had calmed down, and then @ORGANIZATION1 became the mayor of Unpaciente Land and renamed it @CAPS2 Land. From that day forward, everybody was patient, living in peace and harmony."
287	18159	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; we were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated, pacing and sighing, but I told her that the doctor would be out soon. I was very patient, sitting quietly while @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually I’m not very patient; usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, and he was so happy that the two-hour wait was worth it! This was a time when I was patient and it truly paid off in the end.
288	18160	7	3	One time I was patient. It was December @NUM1, @DATE1 @CAPS1 Eve. I was so excited that @CAPS1 was almost here. On @CAPS1 Eve morning I slept till @NUM2, even though I wanted to get up early for the day to come. I was patient so I played video games, not thinking about @CAPS1 and the presents. When I went to the store I seen all the @CAPS1 things, the decorations and the gifts. I felt like I couldn’t wait no longer, the excitement was almost too much. That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay up instead of going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up, so I made some more food and then finally went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there was the presents, all under the tree. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some TV until @NUM3 came and I wanted to open them so badly, but I knew it wouldn’t be right without my family, so I waited patiently. At noon I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, and I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy I had waited.
289	18161	7	3	When I was patient I had no fears, no argument, but I had a good deal. I had a @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 was so good my sister @PERSON1 said, “@CAPS2, I get some?” I said, “@CAPS3, you @CAPS2.” @CAPS4 was a miracle, so I was driving her car at the gas station. I went to @ORGANIZATION1 and I said, “@NUM1 @CAPS5, please.” @CAPS4 was a cousin of mine and she said, “@NUM2 days ago.” I was like, “Wow.” @PERSON1 called my phone because @CAPS4 was my daddy’s weekend and she said, “Get down there now.” I was like, wow, but I remained calm and patient throughout the whole situation, handling everything without getting upset.
290	18162	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog Penny—she is real, not fake—and @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door, so I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house to rest for a little while. We travelled through lots of small roads until we got to the highway. “@CAPS1’s gonna be a long ride,” I said. We passed so many cars, and then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car in the traffic. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them again. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. During @CAPS2 nap, @CAPS2 parents—@CAPS2 mom—took pictures of me sleeping. I thought that @CAPS1 wasn’t very nice of them. We now had one more state to go through and then we were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room, like a hotel, for the night. In the morning we stopped and ate a quick breakfast. Then it was on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. It felt like the longest five hours ever, but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned on his GPS and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient on a very long journey.
291	18163	7	3	There are many times I’ve been patient, but I will describe @CAPS1 this one specific time. My little sister kept bugging me, and I didn’t scream at her or hit her. She was asking me to turn on the music and I said “no,” which caused her to throw a fit. So I calmly got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she got herself into trouble, using a nice and kind voice. And she stopped crying. And I then told her gently to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was disturbing me. I didn’t become a mean person at that point. Last but not least, that was a time that I was a patient person.
292	18164	7	3	Patience for me is when I'm helping others with their problems, so in this story I'm going to describe to you what patience truly means. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and calmly help someone with their own problems without rushing them. I believe I have a lot of patience because I sit down all the time and help people with their issues. One day at my old school, @PERSON1, this girl was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying, so I went to go ask her what was wrong. She explained that she didn’t want to be at home because her mom didn’t let her go anywhere; she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down with her all day and let her feel like she had someone to talk to for once in her life. As we sat and talked, she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend who would listen. In conclusion, I really felt like I had demonstrated patience that day, and since that day forward I have continued to sit down and let people tell me about their problems.
293	18165	7	3	"There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve and it was about @NUM1 in the morning, meaning I had just woken up. I ate breakfast and brushed my teeth after I got out of the shower. By now I would have probably asked my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadn’t asked her once yet. I was upstairs playing my play station when my mom called me for @CAPS2!!!! I opened my door and, as usual, my cat was right there. I shut my door, hopped over my cat, got to the stairs, and then yelled ""food."" He scurried down the stairs and right to the kitchen. As I started walking down the stairs I heard a @CAPS3!! So I began running down as fast as I could, knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They met me at the counter and asked me, “@CAPS4 many times have you asked to open a present?” “@CAPS5,” I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend’s house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finished our game and took a bike ride; we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2. About @NUM5 minutes later I was done, watched @CAPS6.V., took a shower, and then went to bed. My mom woke me up at @TIME1 and we headed down stairs. As soon as I saw all the presents I screamed with @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day."
294	18166	7	3	“@CAPS1 @CAPS2,” said my little sister @PERSON1, “@CAPS3 you help me practice kicking a soccer ball? We are doing it in gym and I @CAPS6’t know how.” “Of course,” I said, “let’s go to the back yard.” On @CAPS4 my way out I grabbed a ball. I set it down on @CAPS4 the ground in front of me and said, “@CAPS5 you do is step forward with your left foot and kick with the top of your right.” “I’ll try,” @CAPS8 said doubtfully. @CAPS8 ran up to the ball and kicked, but missed; that’s @CAPS7. @CAPS8 tried again and got another miss. @CAPS8 sat down on @CAPS4 the ground, looking defeated. I went up to her and said, “@CAPS6’t give up; it’s only your second try. Not everyone is good at soccer right away. Try one more time.” “@CAPS7, one more try,” @CAPS8 agreed. @CAPS8 ran up to the ball and kicked. This time, the ball went sailing straight into the goal. “@CAPS9 you for teaching me, @CAPS2.” “It was my pleasure. Just try to be patient with yourself and you’ll be a great soccer player, I promise.” “@CAPS7, but I want to practice some more now.” “@CAPS7,” I replied, and we continued practicing together.
295	18167	7	3	Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant of delays or troubles without becoming annoyed or anxious. Many important parts of life are achieved with patience, because some of the best things are truly worth waiting for. @CAPS1 is always a time and a place for everything, and getting there is achieved with the great virtue of patience, which helps us navigate challenges calmly and reach our goals with a steady heart.
296	18168	7	3	We had been patient enough on the long plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient during the tedious process of checking into the hotel. Now, seated at a table in the hotel's own restaurant, was the time for a true test of our patience. Our waitress came over, promptly took our order for drinks and food, and then she disappeared. We received our drinks quickly and then settled in to wait for our meal. We watched the clock as @NUM1 minute passed, then @NUM2 minutes. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 minutes ticked by. After a full hour had elapsed, we managed to call her over and asked for some bread. Lo and behold, she actually brings the bread! We asked her, with growing frustration, where our food was. She promised to bring it out right away. We continued to wait until we had been waiting for a total of @NUM6 hours. Finally, we called the manager over to complain, and he, almost miraculously, brought out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of tested patience, we were finally able to eat our long-awaited meal.
297	18169	7	3	"A time I was patient was when me and my mom and dad and my big brother were going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had to pack up the car and leave in a hurry, and I just wanted to leave it all behind for a fun room and exciting things. We finally packed up and got on the road, and during the long drive I felt any excitement fading. I decided to have my head down and wait for a hot destination heading my way, so I started dreaming about the amusement park having no lines so I could get on every ride in a hurry. I was so hungry for fun. As I was about to get on a ride in my dream, I felt someone shaking me. My eyes opened as I gained light, and it was my brother, vigorously shaking my shoulder. I got up and looked around, and I knew we were there because a big old sign said welcome to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. After all that sleeping, it had paid off after all. But as I looked around, thinking there were no lines, I was heart broken. The lines were as long as having to walk to @LOCATION1 itself; something told me it was going to be a long wait. As I grew impatient, I started to draw in the dirt, and then somebody grabbed me; it was my mom. She said, ""Why are you in a mood?"" I said, ""Because these lines are so long!"" She just said, ""Be patient, it will be worth the wait."" And that is what I did. Finally, it was our turn, so I got on the ride, and she was right; being patient in line was worth the wait, and it was so much more fun to finally get on."
298	18170	7	3	It was @DATE1 when my family and I went to Cedar Point. It was really exciting and fun from the very start. The car trip was about three or six hours long, and for most of it, I went to sleep. But when I woke up, we were at a Burger King. I ordered myself a kids meal, and it was good. So as we got back in the car, I stayed up for the rest of the way there. Then I started seeing water parks and hotels; it was a really nice sight. Then I seen this really tall roller coaster in the distance, and I got so excited that as soon as we entered the park, I ran to the line, but they were all incredibly long. I had to wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was finally my turn in line, I was so happy and excited that when I got my hand stamped, I immediately ran to the @CAPS1-@CAPS2 indoor roller coaster. So I had to wait another hour in that line, and I got really tired, but I kept moving forward slowly. When I finally reached the stairs and then the loading platform, I got on the ride. I was kinda scared at the same time because it was dark inside. Then we took off, and when it got off, I was dizzy, but I went on another ride right after and got even dizzier. I got on this one ride that rocks side to side, and it was a blast. This is the time I was patient, and it led to a great day.
299	18171	7	3	"Waiting in the long line to enter @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I complained loudly, ""@CAPS2! When are we ever going to get into the park?"". ""@CAPS3 patient,"" my mother hissed back at me, her voice low. ""Being patient is so boring!"" I complained again, shifting my weight from one foot to the other. ""Yeah,"" shouted my sister, joining in. ""@CAPS4 so bored! It's not fair and my feet feel hurt and—"" ""@CAPS5!'', shouted my @CAPS2, cutting her off. ""We're almost there, just hold on!"" @CAPS6 @CAPS8 seemed like hours later, we finally got to the front of the line at the ticket booth. ""@CAPS7!"" I moaned, relieved the wait was over. We went inside the park, the gates swinging shut behind us. "" @CAPS8 first?"" I asked, looking around. My sister immediately pointed to a giant ride. ""That one!"" she yelled, and before anyone could answer, she ran towards it. We all followed my sister to the base of the ride. "" @CAPS10, let's ride the @CAPS12. It looks fun,"" said my dad as we walked towards yet another line. "" @CAPS11! More waiting!"" I shouted, my shoulders slumping. ""The @CAPS12 is gonna take forever to get on!"" I complained, my patience thoroughly exhausted for the day."
300	18172	7	3	I showed patience before, and I am about to tell you about that time. It was two years ago. I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to get some money. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much physically demanding work. I got all of the overgrown grass cut at his barn, I cut wood for the winter, and a lot more miscellaneous chores. After around seven hours of hard, sweaty work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could finally have my money. He hesitated when I asked, and when I asked why, he told me the truth. He had given a bunch of money to my uncle for a vacation. My heart sunk deep into my chest. I asked him when I was going to get my pay. He just shook his head like he had no idea. Rage started to fill me from head to toe. One week later, I went back to his house to ask again because I really wanted to buy something special. He just shook his head no again. My mind said to have patience, but my body said to have no patience. In the end, I listened to my mind. Waiting was really difficult at my uncle's, but I knew patience was the right thing to do, as patience can bring an opportunity. Three weeks later, he still hadn't gotten me my money. Then I heard someone knock on my door at home. I moved over to it and opened it. It was my @CAPS1. He came inside with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly, he opened my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1, that’s more than double what you owed me,” I said, my heart throbbing with surprise and joy. “I know, but you deserve it for being so patient,” he replied. I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did me good to have patience because I made so much more money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off in a big way.
301	18173	7	3	When I was about nine years old, I took my homework home with me. I showed one of my older brothers my homework, feeling a little unsure about it. He looked at it and then he started helping me with it, explaining the process in a way I could understand. Then he did a couple of answers to show me what I had to do because I didn’t really know how to do my homework properly. So he had to do his own homework, and he told me to do mine. So I started to do my homework, and I did all of my questions correct, feeling a growing sense of confidence. But there was a really hard question on it that stumped me. I wanted to ask my older brother for more help, but instead I didn’t do that because he was doing his work and I didn't want to disturb him. So I took a deep breath and did it myself, figuring it out after a few minutes of careful thought.
302	18174	7	3	At Middleton Middle School, I’m one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, and I’m new here, but you @MONTH1 think that I’m a boy. Well, if you do, you better listen and listen hard, @CAPS16, I’m not going to say this twice; patience is a virtue. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class and I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2,” @CAPS3 said. “My name’s @CAPS4,” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2,” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1,” @CAPS4 replied. “@CAPS11, let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends, but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends, they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just wouldn’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally, I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17, @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.” “@CAPS15?” @CAPS3 asked, crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 couldn’t do the same thing. “@CAPS16, you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry that @CAPS3 couldn’t understand. “@CAPS17 be that way, @CAPS1!” @CAPS3 said, storming out of the room. “@CAPS4, wait!” I cried, but I had to run after her. “@CAPS20, please, you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know you’re trying to protect me, but it’s @CAPS17. Have you ever heard of patience before?” I asked, ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21,” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13, and we never had a problem again, our friendship growing stronger from the experience.
303	18175	7	3	I was on my way to Tennessee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1, and my grandpa and grandma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 were driving in two different cars; I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1’s white Mercedes. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1’s gold minivan. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber, a sharp, unpleasant odor. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, and as @CAPS6 slowed down, @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over, @CAPS2 got out, took one look, and said, “@CAPS6’re leaking trannie fluid.” @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us closely. @CAPS6 stopped at an auto shop; @CAPS6 were the only people there, and the mechanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto the lift, and that was when I saw the garage for the first time. It smelled like gas; everything was greasy and dirty, including the mechanics. “@CAPS7 is going to ruin our trip,” I said to @CAPS2. “@CAPS6 don’t know that for sure,” he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minivan and the garage for about two hours, my anxiety growing. Some of the other mechanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wrong with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, but it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left, @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 garage for a tune-up, but @CAPS6 weren’t sure if that was related. After sitting at the shop for about three hours, I got hungry, and so did everyone else, so @CAPS6 went to a restaurant across the street for lunch. @CAPS2 stayed at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch, @CAPS2 said, “We’re going to have to call Triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!!” I was so upset; after all @CAPS7 waiting, @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restaurant, I tripped and landed on my wrist. I sprained my wrist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street, and behind the auto shop was a Walmart, so @CAPS6 stopped there, got a bandage for my wrist, and picked out a book to buy. I got The Vampire Diaries, and @PERSON1 got a Star Wars book. @CAPS6 read them on the way home in @CAPS12’s car, the long day finally coming to a quiet end.
304	18177	7	3	When I went deer hunting with my dad, I learned what it truly meant to be patient. When me and my dad went deer hunting, I had to be patient by waiting for long hours in the cold, silent woods. The hardest part was being quiet, too, as any sound could scare away the animals. I also had to stay still for what felt like an eternity, my muscles aching from the lack of movement. Being patient is waiting for something important, even when it is difficult. I had to be patient because I was waiting for a deer all day, hoping for just one clear shot. Even though I did not get a deer in the end, I was quiet, I was still, and I was patient, and that in itself felt like a small victory.
305	18178	7	3	Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, and I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get all the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments or missing important calls. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone to coordinate. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am dedicated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m dedicated, I’ve kept my grades up, and now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I’m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too, though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now to show I can handle the responsibility. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom and a way to stay connected. I still have a long ways to go, but it will all be worth it in the end when I can finally hold my own cell phone in my hand.

And if you don't have patience you won't be able to finish stuff you start, which can hold you back from achieving your goals. Ultimately, learning to be patient is a key ingredient for success and positive relationships with others.
307	18180	7	3	This story is about the time my mom ran out of gas. My mom was driving down the highway one evening while driving home. Soon we started running out of gas, and the warning light came on. The bad thing is, it was raining heavily at the time. Then we ran out of gas completely and had to pull over to the shoulder. First she had to get someone to pull over and ask if they had a cell phone, since hers had no charge. Someone finally did stop to help. She asked if they could get some gas for us. Every one said “No!” in response. My mom then decided to call my dad and ask him to get gas for our car. He then shows up an hour later with a couple gallons of gas in a can. That was just enough to get us to the nearest station and then home. If my mom had lost her patience she would have gone crazy, but she remained calm throughout the entire stressful situation.
308	18181	7	3	One day when I was out camping with my friend Alex I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours and hours and hours for him to be ready, then he said after our lunch we could go. Then I asked him again after lunch and he finally said yes. But when I saw how steep the dunes were I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it, but I did it anyway. After I got to the top, I was completely out of breath. I fell and just stayed there like a dead animal, too tired to move. After five minutes I was good and started climbing to the very top of the dune because after I got up I decided to run down the other side. When my friend told me to stop I tried to stop, but I couldn't. Then I got sand in my coat pocket, which made me stumble. Then I hit a hidden rock and did an unexpected front flip through the air. Then I fell hard onto the sand, and when my friend came down to check on me we both laughed about my clumsy fall and walked back to our campsite together, ending our adventure with a funny story.
309	18182	7	3	My name is Jamie and I’m writing about a time I had to be patient. It was a nice summer morning in July; it was the eighteenth and we were going to drive down to the beach for a vacation we were going to have at Disney Land. Everybody was up in the household packing everything into a van that we rented for the trip so every one would fit into the car comfortably. We had packed all our things into the car and were almost ready. My mom made us a good breakfast before we left. It was a hearty meal of sausage, pancakes and bacon and scrambled eggs. It was delicious and filled us up for the long drive. After that we got into the car and we were on the highway; I had fallen asleep about an hour into the drive. By the time I woke up, it was ten o'clock at night and dark outside. My sister was yelling at my brother and then me and my sister got into an argument ourselves. My mom told all of us to be quiet and we did, but we were all getting on each other's nerves from being in the car for so long. And I had to be patient for another two days of travel, but we finally got there and I was glad to be there, so overall it was a fun trip until we had to go back home again.
310	18183	7	3	I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my four-wheeler. I had been looking forward to it all day. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting, which was disappointing. He came home three hours after I had hoped. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home except for my grandma, and my dad doesn’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle John is not there for supervision. At that point I was feeling very impatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again, which was even more frustrating. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle John showed up unexpectedly and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler. He told me I could if my dad said it was okay. So I called my dad and he said it was fine if my uncle John said it was fine with him and that he would watch me. Then I could finally ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore, enjoying the ride until the sun went down.
311	18184	7	3	Hunting requires a great deal of patience in it. Hunting is not something where you can just go and get a deer. You have to wait and watch quietly. Because deers do not come right to you. Deer do not like people at all, and so a deer can smell you from far away. If you are not patience you will not get nothing. You must sit still for a long time, not making a sound, if you hope to see one. The wait can feel very long, but it is the only way to succeed. Without this quiet waiting, you will go home with an empty truck. That is why patience is the most important part of hunting.
312	18185	7	3	Last year I had to sell my cow because she was sick and could not have a calf. I have felt a heavy weight for eight months, wanting to get a new calf but I didn't know where I would get one. I asked my uncle who raises a small cow breed which normally costs a lot of money, but he gave me a deal on her for a lower price. It took me eight month's to find her. But during those eight month's I got very tenacious and I couldn't sleep very well at night. I was so happy when I got her home, relieved I had found her when I did. I still wory about her at night because of the cougar that is rooming the cluntury side. I check on her often, hoping she stays safe in the barn.
313	18186	7	3	Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I don't also, but it is sometimes necessary. Well I am going to tell you about a time when I was inpatient and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get to the bus stop a few min early, so I can talk with my mother before it comes. One day I got up too early. I made it to the bus stop very early. After a few min later I decided to go back home to get a jacket. By the time I got home I was going to be late. I hurried back to the door, but I was too late, the bus was already gone. I should have more patient. On another day I was going to a burger place to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. When I got their, their where about several peace in their, so I decided to wait my turn in line like I had learned. I was their and watched people payed from the cash regester. I was finally their and I ordered my burger, and when I was done eating it, it was worth the wait. In conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. Sports, school or home and even in public, I hope my story made you relise how important it is to be patient in life.
314	18187	7	3	A time I was patient was at a concert a few years ago at a large venue. I was about a teenager in the early evening when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about thirty minutes till the first band came on stage, the name of their band was from a city. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock band. But they were just a regular band that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next band was one I new lots about; their name is a famous one, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was a popular one, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about the town and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about ten o'clock at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the main act boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named after a feeling. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did spins, and a jump. It went several feet in the air and did flips and everything you can imagine. Their lead singer and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about midnight it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again, but my patience that night was truly rewarded.
315	18189	7	3	Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like Christmas for example. I always get up really early on Christmas morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round five am and turn on the Christmas tree lights. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about six am we start getting ancy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About seven am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about twenty min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end when we see all the wonderful gifts.
316	18190	7	3	When I was patient I was in the car and my mom went to get something at the store and I went with her. I was patient because I didn’t tell her when are we gonna go home or complain that this is boring. I tried to go with the flow and just waited quietly. I was there for an hour but did I care? No, because I was the one who wanted to come along and I came. If I would have complained then she would have said, “then why did you come?” At the end, my mom said since you have been so patient then you can get a chocolate bar. So if you're patient, there might be a nice reward at the end.
317	18191	7	3	When I was very patient was the time I had to get my teeth pulled. It had took two hours, and they would take a break for about ten minutes every half an hour. I had gotten many shots in my mouth to numb the pain. And they had ripped my gum open and took out two teeth, then my two bottom teeth. I was practicing patience then, sitting still through it all. They even said I was one of their best kids because of everything I had went through in my mouth and the long time it took without panicking. This was the time I got four teeth pulled and was very patient.
318	18192	7	3	“When can I drive?” I whined. “When the time comes you have to be patient, otherwise you won’t!” yelled my dad over the loud, heart warming sound of the engine starting up for the first time that year. I loved that sound. It’s my second favorite sound. The vibrations rattling my legs as it races away with my brother driving. I could wait until my turn, watching intently. After a few rides and twenty minutes, Dad said the words I thought he’d never say, “Okay, your turn.” I looked at him then the truck. Wow, does he look small next to that big truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climbed onto the tire's rim, then to the top of the tire, and into the cab. “Let’s go! Oh yeah!” This felt right. I couldn’t go fast but I almost tipped it over, so that’s a good thing. So all in a nutshell, patience comes a long way and pays off.
319	18193	7	3	I don’t have much patience, but I’ll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was Tuesday after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to Landslide skate park. We were all at my home but Jake wasn’t. My mom said, “If he’s not here in two minutes we have to go without him”. So I was mad, but I waited. I was writing a note to put on the door that reads, “Jake, we had to go without you because you were late! Sorry, be on time next time.-Mark”. But just when I was signing the note, he pulled up into the driveway. That was the story when I had patience and it worked out.
320	18194	7	3	One time in fifth grade, I was taking a test called the state assessment (SOL). Me, and my friends got done with the SOL early. So we had to be patient too, waiting quietly for the others to finish. We had a lot that we could do, like read a book, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard; sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really only twenty minutes have gone by. Sometimes patience requires a lot of mental peace to stay calm. One time me, and my dad were going to work in the city. The bus was late fifteen minutes, but it felt like a few weeks of waiting. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal; the audience was patient enough so that the team could score. A bad patience is when you’re late to work, and there's traffic, or the bus was late, and you just have to wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, like texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game with a kid or by yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, and also requires a lot of mental peace to manage well.
321	18195	7	3	When I was around the age of eight, I went to a family reunion with my grandpa, grandma, mom, and dad. We stopped so many times I can't even count. I think it was to use the restroom or get snacks, but I did not want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like. It was a big event, but the worst part was we had to leave our dog home for a week. I was impatient to get home, too, because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep in my own bed. We got up to leave from our house at five in the morning and we got to the motel at two in the afternoon. I was sick of sitting in the car, and I did not want to get back in the car to go home because if you think of it, that is a long way to wait in the car. I was very impatient because if I could have gotten there in a half an hour it would have been a lot better than like, nine hours of time. But it was a lot of fun to see new things that you have never seen before on your way there, because on our way home, I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient; I was so bored that at every stop I would switch cars. I did not have anything to do at that time, but I did have my Nintendo DS until it died. Then I made do with my iPod and my cell phone; all I could do was call and play games on that. But I was so impatient at the corner, too, because I would rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there listening to older people talk about what has happened. I didn't know hardly any of them; I could not tell you who everyone was, and that just made the waiting feel even longer.
322	18196	7	3	I was patient this one time while waiting to get on the computers. I told my mom to wake me if she gets off the computer, and after an hour I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up after a little while and my brother was on for three hours reading manga we already have. After three minutes my dad kicked me off to check his email. He said he would be off soon, yet he spent the rest of the day and a bit more of the next day watching Indiana Star for six hours. This was even though he spends eight hours on a computer at work, so that adds up to fourteen or more hours on the internet every day of the year. It was frustrating to wait so long for just a few minutes of time, and it taught me that sometimes patience doesn't always get you what you want.
323	18197	7	3	There was this guy that I liked a lot that I finally had the courage to ask out after two years and three weeks. He said yes to go to the dance with me but no to going out. So a little while later, like a week later, I asked him again. He told me to give him till the end of the week. So I waited and waited, and on and on it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn't take it; she asked him on Thursday and he said yes! A million yeses and joy came from his mouth. Then, after getting to know me better, he broke up with me. We have been fighting ever since, but we're still besties! It was a confusing time, but it showed me that some things are worth waiting for, while others are better left as friendships.
324	18198	7	3	Being patient is hard and not all people are patient, but patience is an important thing to do. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like waiting in line is being patient. You have to be patient with people, too, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient at an amusement park, which was really hard to do. When I was really little, maybe four or five years old, we went there. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldn't go because I was too short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my dad went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antsy. After a while I started asking, “When is the ride going to be over, mama?” She kept responding, “I don't know, whenever your sister and dad get off the ride.” Gosh, I couldn't wait, but when my dad and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said “ok” and that's when I got sad. Then she said to me, “but because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothie.” “I love smoothies,” I screamed. Patience is important, because I was so patient my mom got me something I love. Patience is a hard thing to do but once you got it, it’s a good thing to do and can lead to sweet rewards.
325	18200	7	3	"Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up when she tested my vision and hearing and felt my throat, too. She listened to my chest to see if my heart was okay. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck; about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a thyroid issue, which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous; I had butterflies really bad and then twenty minutes passed which seemed like an hour. They called me in and I sat down; the nurse said everything will be fine. So I trusted her; she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm. It sorta hurt like a pinch then one... two... three... and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube, which was really cool. Then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious, and they called my mom, which took about a year, not really, but I could not tell by her expression. Then she said no, and I was so happy. I was being patient, which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and find out myself, and in the end, that patience was rewarded with good news."
326	18201	7	3	“When do we get the Xbox!” I asked my dad impatiently. “Two hours,” he replied calmly. “Seriously!” “Yes.” “Fine.” “Fine.” Two hours…. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer, clicking aimlessly through websites. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was interesting. Next I picked up the t.v. guide, scanning the listings. Nothing good was on. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did so much yesterday, I was thinking but luckily, before I could finish the thought, I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up later, groggy. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide; still nothing. Out of sheer boredom, I just turned the t.v on. A movie had just ended. “Coming up next on Filmland is The Inspector,” the channel’s commercial said. “I have to see this,” I said out loud to the empty room. It turned out better than I thought. It was a black and white film that was about a police official and his son solving a big case. After watching four hours of the movie, completely absorbed, I heard the front door open and creak. I heard my dad come in and say in a cheerful voice, “I got it!” A wave of relief washed over me, and then I said, “Finally,” and then, completely exhausted, I fell back asleep. “Don’t you dare wake him up,” my dad whispered to someone in the room.
327	18202	7	3	One time my brother Alex was incredibly patient. Patience is being understanding and listening through difficulties without complaining. Our family lived in Ohio and were going to Cedar Point on a summer vacation. We had fun all day riding roller coasters and playing games, and at four o'clock we decided to go on the Power Tower. Alex chose to go on the blue Power Tower while the rest of the family went on the red one. The blue version keeps you suspended at the top for a few moments and then drops you suddenly, while the red one shoots you straight up to three hundred feet. The line for the red Power Tower was much shorter than the blue one so we got to go on our ride first. Once our ride was over and we got off, Alex was already at the very top of the blue Power Tower. We heard a loud mechanical sound that meant the blue Power Tower car was coming down. But the blue car wasn’t coming down. Alex was stuck at the top, two hundred and forty feet in the air. He got a complete bird’s eye view of the entire park. I would have been terrified and screaming if I were Alex. At six o’clock, as the sun was setting, the ride lights came on brightly and the car finally plummeted down. Finally, after a long wait, he got his ride. As an apology, each person on the ride got free season passes to Cedar Point. This is a clear time when Alex truly needed to show patience, and he handled the situation calmly.
328	18203	7	3	On Saturday morning we went to the Dollar Tree first because my mom needed to pick up a few things. I really wanted to go to the Game Stop instead to look at the new video games. But I was patient and did not complain while we browsed the aisles. Then, after she finished her shopping, we finally went to the Game Stop, and my patience was rewarded.
329	18205	7	3	In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt real sick, so I took a shower and put on my clothes slowly. I told my dad in a weak voice, “can I go to the doctor because I feel sick?” He said “we will leave at nine am” and it was only seven am. Then, I had to wait on the couch, feeling miserable, while my brothers, my dad and my mom were all taking showers one after another. After that, I really wanted to yell and complain loudly because they were going too slow and tried acting all calm and beautiful. But I didn’t. When they finally finished, they had to look for the car keys for a while until they found them under a newspaper. It was eight-thirty am and my dad’s favorite music video was on television, so we stayed and watched the whole thing. In the middle of the morning, it was ten am and then we finally went to the doctor’s office and had to stay in the waiting room, waiting for everyone to get their turn until it was eleven, which was our turn. We had actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me, my throat and temperature, and it was nothing serious. So I left the examination room and I still waited patiently until my brothers finished with the doctor. In the end, I was a little pissed off because I had to wait for them all to get in the car and get settled. My dad said “Are you happy now? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you.” Then we went home, and I was thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself quietly, “I learned my lesson and it is that if you are patient, the day can go by fast without so much stress.”
330	18206	7	3	Over the winter break I went to Orlando, Florida to visit my aunt. My family got up early and drove to the airport; it was the first time I was going to go on a plane. My dad said I better have patience or else the long ride was going to be boring. Me and my sister got on the plane and flew to Atlanta, and it took one hundred and twenty minutes and that part was easy. But then we got on another, larger plane and went directly to Orlando and that took another two hours. It was a very long ride but I had patience, sitting quietly and looking out the window. My sister, however, didn't have any patience at all; the whole ride she was constantly asking which time we were going to get there. And that was the time I truly learned about having patience during a long journey.
331	18207	7	3	"A time I was patient. My family were going to go camping, so my family got packed up and locked the car. The car ride was two hours long so I had to be patient. I played my PlayStation for a couple of minutes; it was a school day but we left early so we could do some things when we got there. Then I tried to read my book; I was so excited. But I couldn't with my cousins, Sarah and Emily, screaming and yelling. I finally fell asleep. Then we hit a pothole and our car was out of gas. Luckily, we were right in front of a gas station. It took us an hour to get it fixed, so we snacked on a granola bar thing and we left. Then my cousins got all excited, shouting, ""The sign! We are almost there!"" I was happy I could put up my tent and go to sleep. I saw our camp ground and when we got there we had to put everything up. I had to be patient to go to sleep. Then the kids found a park and, of course, they wanted to go. My mom wanted me to take them; I was so tired I didn't want to go to the park. So we stayed at the campsite. My uncle yelled that the park was pretty close to the camp site anyway. I ate my dinner as quickly as I possibly could and then I went into my tent and went to sleep."
332	18208	7	3	I was patient when I was going to Cedar Point. We took a bus and it took seven hours. So my friend Jake decided to watch movies on the portable DVD player. We watched *Street Dreams* and *The Incredibles*. We were still a long way from Cedar Point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilarious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road through the window. Eventually we both fell asleep from the gentle rocking of the bus. When we woke up we were there, finally arriving at the amusement park. This is the time I waited patiently. Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting, like watching a movie or taking a nap. Now I can wait much longer without getting frustrated. This lesson in patience has helped me greatly in my future.
333	18209	7	3	I was patient during the MEAP test. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my homework, but I didn't have any work so I just waited quietly. Then when everyone got done we waited for five minutes before we started the MEAP test again. When I got done with that section, no one else was done so I waited for ten or fifteen minutes. Then everyone was done and we stretched and walked around for ten minutes before we sat back down to start part five. When we are done we get to do quiet work, and I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get a good score and high marks on my tests like the MEAP test because it is so important to get good grades. When you are patient you will find out you can get good grades like advanced and proficient.
334	18210	7	3	"On my last trip to Cedar Point I made a horrible mistake. I waited in line for two hours for the Mantis roller coaster. I had to be patient, but it was hard to because the mist fans were having technical difficulties. And how can I be patient when it is ninety-five degrees outside?! The only good part of the line was the shade. That was the way I kept my patience. I told myself, ""Just be calm, and in no time you will be there."" But I spoke too soon. Half an hour seemed like two hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally, after two long hours in line, the mist fans began to lift our spirits. Patience can bring luck. I waited for what seems like only ten minutes but was actually an hour. After I got off the ride, I was so relieved to feel the breeze. I guess patience, in some ways, is the key to success."
335	18211	7	3	One day a man named John had a doctor’s appointment and overslept; when John got out of bed he saw that he was late. As John got out of bed he rushed into the bathroom to take a quick shower, as if he had time for that. John noticed it was getting later so he didn’t get to wash up or brush his teeth, so he grabbed a piece of gum on the way out the door. John finally got to the doctor's office, went inside, and saw there were millions of people in the waiting room. He went to check his name in and sat down in a stiff chair. He started to get frustrated and tired of waiting, so he calmed himself down and realized the importance of patience. John kept himself busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and the many apps he had downloaded. John was so busy he didn’t realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check-ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called his name for his appointment. As John was going in he put one, maybe two pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking to the nurse. John was done with his check-up, zoomed home, flew into the shower, and brushed his teeth thoroughly. He got back in the bed and went straight to sleep.
336	18212	7	3	Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: I cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock, counting down the minutes until the bell rings. I just can’t wait for class to be over most of the time, my mind already racing ahead to what I will do next. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much, like when I skip ahead in my reading or hurry through my homework. I wish I was patient, but I’m not. I’m not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious and excited about the future event. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends, imagining meeting my friends or going home to relax. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style and learn to be more calm. I don’t think that will happen anytime soon, but it remains a small hope for the future.
337	18213	7	3	Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to be patient to succeed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer, completely absorbed in a game. I was surfing the web and enjoying it when my mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair, a little annoyed at the interruption. I walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to the store to get some groceries and was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sandwich when she returned. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room, folded laundry and watched television to pass the time. It was about two o'clock and she still wasn’t home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her, thinking of all the things that could have happened. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says about being patient to succeed. About a half an hour later she got home, her arms full of bags. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important, and I also think everyone could use a little more of it in their daily lives.
338	18215	7	3	Patience in my way of saying is a person that waits awhile if she needed to. The only reason I'm putting this in my own way is because no one is patient in my family; we are all always in a rush. Patience is a person where if they were stuck in traffic then they’ll be able to sit and wait calmly, or if there’s a really long wait in line they won't complain. Or they’ll be able to wait for something they need without getting frustrated or giving up. Patience is just waiting for my turn, I should put it that way. It’s about waiting if I have to, like when my favorite snack is gone and I have to wait for it to come back to the store. Or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it, that requires patience. That’s what patience means to me in my own way, a quiet strength in everyday situations.
339	18217	7	3	I am going to tell you about a time I was impatient. I had been working every day in the summer, taking on any odd job I could find. I was trying to do the best I could to make money, mowing lawns and helping neighbors. I was saving up to buy a three hundred dollar bow, a thirty dollar target, forty dollar broadheads, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday, checking my savings constantly. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it on smaller, immediate things. Finally, after what felt like forever, I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff immediately and I practiced all day long, every day. Soon I became more accurate and confident with my new bow. I was ready to go hunting, my excitement at its peak. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards, deciding to wait for a bigger buck. I haven’t had anything close enough to shoot since then, which has been a lesson in patience all its own.
340	18218	7	3	One time when I was patient was when the flu shot was going around. I had to go to this one place to get the flu shots, a community center set up for the day. When we got there we got in line, and I had to be patient because the line was really long and slow-moving. We brought chairs, hot cocoa and stuff to do to keep us on our feet and pass the time. I had to be patient until I got to the front of the line, which inched forward at a snail's pace. The worse part was that most of the time was spent waiting outside and it was Christmas Eve, so I had to be patient in the cold, shivering while we waited. When we finally got inside the building I was so happy to feel the warmth. Then about three hours later we got to the front of the line and received our shots quickly. I’m glad that I never have to wait in line for three hours to get a flu shot again, but I am also glad I managed to be patient through it.
341	18219	7	3	I was patient with my game, but it was taking too long and got me so frustrated that I ended up punching my big truck. It was making me mad, and then my mom came up to see what was happening. She hinted that I calm down, so I went down the stilts and got my mom some money. She bought me a trailer for my house, and she took her own way to help me. I am patient now until the end. I’m patient to go to lunch; I got @NUM1 for lunch, so I got @NUM2 house to go to for lunch, so I don’t take a nap for some guests now. It's @NUM3 hours until I’ll have lunch, and I’m mad to wait for it. It is @NUM4 till lunch now, and when I was doing the test, I forgot to ask for some game time. Over it is @NUM5, we go to lunch; it is @NUM6, we got to lunch now. I heard a line, and I got her patient for something. She told me we should go, and she made my salad so good. I ate all of it, then drank my milk, then we tried to be patient for my turn to get some great treats. I was happier than ever when I finally received them.
342	18220	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice here at @ORGANIZATION1. It didn’t happen until the very end of our session, and no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere when I hit the wall. I had an accident while we were running suicides. I was running too fast and I couldn’t stop, so I went head-first into the wall. It was a brick wall too, which made it worse. I didn’t panic because I knew I had to be patient throughout the whole ordeal. I had to wait on a lot of things starting with an ambulance, which took a long time to arrive. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches, which didn’t take very long. Lastly, I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers so I could leave. It happened in the @DATE1, but I can’t remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade at the time. It happened because I couldn’t stop in time during the drill. When I hit my head it didn’t hurt initially, but when I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didn’t hurt, but I had a massive headache for a while. I was glad when everything was over and I could finally go home.
343	18221	7	3	I am a very patient person, and a good example of this is how I am with games. For some games you have to wait weeks, or even months, for a new release or an update. For others you might have to wait years for the next installment in a series. I have done this before, waiting calmly without getting overly frustrated, because I understand that good things often require time. This patience has helped me enjoy the games even more when they finally arrive.
344	18222	7	3	I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for the opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 for this @DATE1. The line must have had at least @NUM1 people ahead of us. This is one of the largest apple orchards in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also named @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, yet the line was still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster with anticipation. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 seconds, feeling like time had forgotten to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement over the loudspeaker. Beep! “@CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. I’m sorry. Thanks for your cooperation,” click. I heard everyone in the line groan in disappointment. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down on the ground to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! It’s time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9!” That was my story of being patient, and it was worth the wait.
345	18223	7	3	Waiting for my child was the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I had been in the hospital waiting room for nearly the whole time, pacing and sitting by turns. The nurses kept giving me updates, trying to calm me, but it was to no avail. So I stepped out for a smoke to ease my nerves. I didn’t know if my wife, or our baby would live through the delivery. Would it live a happy life? I just took a puff of smoke, and waited for hours, sitting and shutting out the rest of the world to shield myself from my own anxious thoughts. Would it be picked on in school? I sat there, ignoring the nurses' pleading attempts to reassure me. Would it shut life out when things got hard? I sat, waiting for my newborn child, lost in these fears. My silence was finally broken by the sound of a baby crying. I rushed over to my wife’s room, to find her holding a beautiful baby girl. “Took you long enough,” I said, my heart finally at ease.
346	18225	7	3	A time that I had patience is when my family went to @CAPS1 Adventures and we were in line to go on Shiver Me Timbers, the biggest coaster at the park. “We are in line,” I said to a kid that had cut in front of my friend @PERSON1 and I as we went up the ramp to get on the ride. The kid went to the back of the line that just got longer, @CAPS3 and kids screamed. As we got up to the top of the ramp, the ride had mashed up so we sat there for about an hour, and then they fixed it. We got in and I took off my glasses. The ride started. We went up the biggest hill, then a smaller one, then another smaller one! Then a turn, then the last hill. We exited like a diver going @NUM1 mph and the ride was over. That was a time I had patience.
347	18226	7	3	We were driving to @LOCATION1. My uncle lived there so since he always came to our house we were going to his new house. I was excited about going there, but there was one problem, it was over a ten hour drive. My parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and I felt so tired. I looked at the clock and it said six thirty a.m. I knew we weren't bringing a lot of food and things so we went to get packed up and in the van but it took longer that it seemed like it would last. My dad said we would leave around seven thirty but it was an hour more that we planned. We got all packed up and we were on the road. It was about an hour in I fell asleep in the back seat. We made a stop an hour and @DATE1 and I woke up. After we got back, me and my brother watched a movie on our portable dvd player. We kept driving there and I knew it would take a while but I kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. When we got there @DATE1 it was great. Their house was up in a mountain, I had fun visiting them and we walked around town and went into stores. I had fun seeing my uncle and aunt. This was the time I was patient.
348	18227	7	3	A time I was patient was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. Adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide, the biggest water slide there. It had the longest line there; it made a swirl and my family was at the end of the swirl. It was early morning when we had finally gotten in and went to the leaver water slide. It was huge, just about @NUM1 feet tall. And we got in line and only a half an hour had gone by when my mom left it. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my other brother, my sister, and my dad left in line. Then someone got hurt on the ride and they shut it down for two hours. Finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it is only my dad and me left in the line. So it was our turn on the ride next when my dad got scared and left so it was me and an old man who went on the same little flat. The old man met his pants and I was so happy to finally get on the ride.
349	18228	7	3	Patience is very important, as it can help you be successful in many things. In school, patience is very important because some things just have to wait. Being patient in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other person makes his or her move you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting calmly. For example, everyone is excited on @CAPS1 eve and can’t wait till morning but they have to be patient and wait till morning. Also on your birthday you don’t know what you’ll get but instead of peeking you have to be patient until you can open the presents up. Patience is a very helpful skill to have in life.
350	18229	7	3	“@CAPS1! Today is the day we get to go to @CAPS2 point,” @CAPS3 @PERSON1 exclaimed. “@CAPS4 on @PERSON1, lets get this show on the road,” @CAPS5 announced. The @CAPS6 were planning a vacation to go to @CAPS7 point @CAPS22 @DATE1 long and today is the day they got to go. The family got @CAPS22 of their suitcases and piled them in the car. When everything was situated, they took off. “@CAPS8 @CAPS11, how long is this drive gonna take?” @CAPS9, @PERSON1’s older sister, asked. “@CAPS10, about six hours sweetie,” @CAPS11 replied. The @CAPS6 lived in @LOCATION1, @CAPS21 they had to drive a long way to get to @LOCATION2. “@CAPS13 @CAPS11!!! I can’t survive six hours in a car!!!”. “@CAPS14 @CAPS9, you wanted to @CAPS4 here, you just have to have patience like @CAPS3 @PERSON1 here.” “I guess I will not wait.” @CAPS15 about three hours in the car @CAPS9 kept repeatedly asking the question “Are we there yet?” @CAPS16 though the answer was always “@CAPS17,” she asked it anyways. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 eventually got annoyed of this and shouted “stop it! Just have some patience!”, “@CAPS18, @CAPS18,” @CAPS9 replied, “I will stop.” @CAPS15 about two more hours, they finally arrived. The parents bought the tickets and asked their children what ride they wanted to go on. They both smiled and said “The @CAPS20.” @CAPS21 they walked up to the line, and waited. They just waited, and waited some more. @CAPS15 what seemed like four hours waiting in line, @CAPS9 gave up and shouted “I don’t want to wait in line anymore! I am leaving!” @CAPS21 the family walked back into the car, and drove off. When they got settled, @PERSON1 told @CAPS9, “@CAPS22 it takes is some patience and you can have some fun.” @CAPS9 didn’t respond, having learned a difficult lesson about the value of waiting.
351	18230	7	3	One day @PERSON1’s mom, “@CAPS1,” decided to go shopping and @PERSON1 desperately wanted to go. But his mom kept saying, “@CAPS2.” So @PERSON1 begged and begged until his mom finally said, “@CAPS3, but you can’t complain,” so @PERSON1 went shopping with his mom. Then @PERSON1 and his mom arrived at the store. Just about @DATE1 later, @PERSON1 said, “I’m bored, can we go now?” His mom replied, “@CAPS2, just be patient.” @PERSON1 then said, “Patient? You want me to be patient? We’ve been here for like @DATE1 hours!” His mom corrected him, “We have only been here for ten @DATE1.” “I have @CAPS2 more patience,” said @PERSON1 sarcastically. So his mom made a deal with @PERSON1; it was, if you be good for @NUM1 more @DATE1, we will go to the ice cream place. The next @NUM1 @DATE1 made his mom go crazy, with every second @PERSON1 saying, “I’m bored, can we go now?” and “Hurry up!” Finally, @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place. @PERSON1 said, “Wait, we passed it!” His mom said, “I know.” @PERSON1 said, “We made a deal, remember.” His mom said, “Yup, but you broke the deal. So what did you learn?” @PERSON1 said, “That when you make a deal, sign a contract.” His mom said, “@CAPS2, patience is a virtue that you need to learn.” So that is my story about patience in my own way.
352	18231	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4, so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while to complete properly. When we started, some people rushed as fast as they could to get done. I, however, took my time to carefully plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time, so you should use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I was done with the writing section, I went over it thoroughly to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time left. When I was done correcting my work, I waited for everyone else to be done as well by quietly reading a book. That was the time when I was patient and it paid off with a good score.
353	18232	7	3	Patience is everything; ever hear these words? When you are waiting in line for a fast food restaurant, or when you are stuck in traffic, you’re annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind: “patience is everything.” One time I was waiting in the longest line ever, waiting to even see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could see the counter, I saw the employees rushing around trying frantically to get all the orders done. Then I saw the reason for the holdup. There was an old man at the front of the line trying desperately to order. I didn’t blame him; with all those choices, he didn’t know what to pick. The rest of the line wasn’t as patient. “Hurry up!” one said. “Come on, @CAPS1!” another shouted. I just waited patiently, thinking the line wasn’t really being fair. I finally suggested a choice for him, and he ordered. Sure, I was @NUM1 minutes late for my class, but I was patient and understanding towards the old man. What comes around goes around, they say, and the rest of the day I felt good about my good deed.
354	18233	7	3	Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not, you’re normal. @CAPS1-@CAPS1. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help you in the long run. If you and I were patient, our world would be a little bit easier. Like if your brother, for an instant, was in your bathroom and you had to use it, you could wait for him to finish. That is saving arguing and it’s being patient. I say these things like “I’m patient!” but that would be a lie, because I am far from it! I am not saying it’s easy, but we all try our best to be a little more patient each day.
355	18234	7	3	@PERSON1 was a hamster. One day @PERSON1 was out of his cage playing with his owners’ sister hamster, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had just got a brand new hamster toy. @CAPS5 had a bunch of tubes to climb in and a slide and a running wheel. @PERSON1 wished he had one, but @CAPS1, his owner, didn’t have enough money yet. Even when @PERSON1 played in his own cage, he still wanted one. @CAPS5 was very hard for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when @PERSON1 saw @PERSON1 playing in his. This is the story of when @PERSON1 was talking to @PERSON1. “I really wish I had one of those hamster toys,” said @PERSON1. “But @CAPS1, my owner doesn’t have enough money!” “@CAPS2’t worry,” said @PERSON1. “You can play in mine until he does. I hear he’s almost got enough.” “@CAPS3, I guess that’s close enough.” A few days later, @PERSON1 got the brand new toy, newer than @CAPS4’s. “I guess @CAPS5 was worth waiting for!” It was twice as big as @PERSON1’s, so they could share. And they both lived happily ever after.
356	18235	7	3	"I'm not a very patient person, so I'm going to be writing about what patience is. Patience is when you don't complain when you're bored or waiting for something. For example (for your convenience I will be writing a story about patience, please take note that this story is completely untrue) I was walking home and saw an elderly woman; she was having trouble with her groceries. I wanted to help her, but all I was thinking about was my cousin who would be arriving at my house any moment now. I walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help, and she replied, ""If you could, I live over there,"" she pointed to a large tan house. I carried her things to the door. ""There you go,"" I said. ""Would you mind helping me put them away?"" the woman asked. I thought about how my mother never wanted me to go into a stranger's house, but I sort of knew her, so I said that I would help; the woman smiled. I then picked up the bags and said, ""Is your home unlocked?"" ""No, it's not,"" she replied. ""Where are your keys?"" I asked. ""I believe they're lost somewhere in the lawn."" I searched for about a half hour, then I found them under a bush. He brought the keys to her and said, ""There you go,"" she opened the door and he helped her with her groceries. When they were all put away I said, ""Well, I ought to be going."" ""Not without some way I can repay you,"" said the woman. ""Just go find my purse."" I waited and waited; it had to have been an hour. The woman came out of the kitchen with some change. ""Sorry, it's only change, I couldn't find my wallet,"" she said and gave him the change. I left feeling like a good person because I was patient with the woman. I told my mom about my good deed and my cousin got to stay longer. This was my example of patience; if this ever happens to you, make sure you're patient and know the person."
357	18236	7	3	One day coming home from a movie, we were stopped by a train, one very long train. Only the end was near, or so we thought, but after that, a very large engine came by. In the car, it was just me and my older brother; we sat in the car for at least fifteen minutes, but the train showed no signs of ending. But then suddenly it stopped; the train slowed and stopped dead in its tracks. We thought of turning around, but the cars were lined up behind us. In about two minutes, the train began slowly starting again soon after; in three minutes, the train was ended. After the gate went up, we started driving, but another train was coming from the opposite direction. So my dad put the car in reverse and backed it out of there. We were so patient. I'll admit we spent forty-five minutes, almost an hour, of waiting. But we were patient, and that made the long wait worth it in the end.
358	18237	7	3	When we drive to my grandmother's house, I have to be patient. When we are in the car, I really have to be patient because it takes six hours plus the extra time we spend going to the restroom, out for lunch, plus we stay for the night. But when we are on the road, it is so boring. That is how I need to be patient. I have to bring a car bag to entertain me. It contains a book, a pad of paper, my dad’s laptop also. A big factor is my iPod. Especially I don't like that my legs got all cramped and the seat gets uncomfortable. I really hate that feeling. But at the end result, I love arriving; you just have to be patient enough to get there, and the end factor is the best part of the whole trip.
359	18238	7	3	One day at my school, it was lunch and I was very hungry. The lunch line was filled with kids. I could hear my stomach growl; I was so hungry. I stood for ten minutes, then I started thinking maybe I could cut in line. But no, I didn't. It felt like an hour had gone by. I was still waiting, trying to be as patient as possible. Then I realized the line was moving quicker and quicker until I finally got my food and ate. I had only five minutes of recess left, but I was just happy to eat. Patience is rewarded by finally getting what you were waiting for.
360	18239	7	3	"I know someone that was patient. The person was at the doctor's office; she was only six and she still waited patiently. They can fix the problem of impatience by asking nicely, ""Can I go ahead of you, please?"" That will solve everything in a kind and respectful way. That is what I think a respectful way to handle a situation involves, by showing patience and kindness to others."
361	18240	7	3	"I remember a time when I was six, I was waiting in the walking clinic for almost two hours. Feeling restless, I asked them if they could change the waiting room channel to Disney Channel. After the show got over, I fell asleep on the couch, sleeping like forever until I heard them say ""salary,"" which must have been part of a dream. My mom tried waking me up, but she couldn't until I rolled off the couch seat that they had in the kid's area. I was there at the walking clinic for one reason: my asthma had been bad for a while because I'd been sick. When they called me down, my mom said that I was really patient and the nurse even said I was actually patient to be patient that long, so she gave me a lolly pop, a small one. After all of that was done, I went home and went to bed. That's the time I was patient for two hours."
362	18241	7	3	"Someone I know that is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people I know, especially on this certain day. Every once and a while my brothers and sister and I are just kind of hard to handle. We were on our way to church when my brother and I started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason; we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brother and my sister were frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like ""he stuck his tongue out at me"" or ""she pinched me."" Then we finally got to church; I guess my mom figured it would stop once we got there, but no. My three year old brother repeatedly ran around and threw things in the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and I kept talking with my friends. I know I would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why I think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave."
363	18242	7	3	One day at the fair I was patient. I wanted to ride the bumper cars, so I got in line. There were about fifteen people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I waited in line quietly until it was my turn. They let ten people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn, but I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people go in front of us to wait for them. Then after a few more minutes it was our turn; we picked our car and had some fun. That's a time when I was patient at the fair.
364	18243	7	3	During the summer, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didn’t know she had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze; no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didn’t know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didn’t say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who don’t know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in a lot of pain, and the bikes won’t go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I’m not old enough to drive yet, she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didn’t once complain or whine about the pain she was in. She didn’t yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car, while I was pretty much about to hyperventilate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I would’ve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. I’m amazed at my mom’s understanding and tolerance, and I hope I can achieve that too one day.
365	18244	7	3	One day when I went to the doctors to get shots my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flu shots like every other year. When we got in the car to go I kept saying “do we really have to go?” Of course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit; my mom had to get the papers so I just stood there and watched the fish swim around in the large tank. Then my mom said “let’s go in the waiting room.” After that she said I had been very patient for waiting, except for in the car when I was whining. So I said thanks and asked when we were going to get in there. Then when we finally got in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions. Then the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm; she said you are like almost the only one of our kid patients that has been so patient. And that is the story of when I was patient at the doctor's office.
366	18245	7	3	"Some people are naturally patient, while others are not. Some individuals have short attention spans and find it difficult to wait. Patience is a quality of a person who is understanding and tolerant, someone who experiences difficulties without complaining. On the other hand, some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something to happen; they are simply not patient. There is a common saying that goes, ""patience is a virtue,"" and many have heard of that. For instance, patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a popular movie and not having to move around or become agitated. Patience is not demonstrated by pacing back and forth in frustration. Ultimately, being patient when facing problems is a fine and admirable trait to cultivate in life."
367	18246	7	3	I remember on @DATE1, my family took a trip to @ORGANIZATION1. After @CAPS3 got to the airport, @CAPS3 had to wait a long time before we could depart. So there @CAPS3 are at the airport, about to leave to go to @LOCATION1 when our flight is delayed because an early morning thunderstorm rolled in. The waiting @CAPS6 took forever, and every minute seemed like an hour. @CAPS1 after about half an hour I asked for some money to get some breakfast, but of course my mom said, “@CAPS2.” I was about to lose my patience completely when this guy came over the speaker and announced, “@CAPS3 will have to delay the flight to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 a little longer.” @CAPS4 when I remember that I have a @CAPS5 in my bag and I go to turn @CAPS6 on, only to find that @CAPS6 is dead. Then after an hour, the storm finally stopped and @CAPS3 were able to board the plane. From that day I found out I’m not a very patient person after all.
368	18247	7	3	"This is a story about patience. One day my friend asks me, ""Hey, have you ever been patient?"" I told him no, I have never in my life been very patient. ""Well, you should be,"" he told me. Another day, my friend is telling me about a new game that is coming out, and I just talk over him while he was talking. I could tell that he did not like it at all. Later, in class, I am telling everyone that I beat him in a race. But I had no patience in me, so I started complaining to him, insisting, ""I won!"" and he said, ""You have no patience."" The argument kept going on and on. Then my other friend said, ""Stop it right now! I am sick and tired of this; you have no patience and you lost the @NUM1 game!"" Okay, sometimes we all have complained in our lives! ""Just stop fighting, please."" So the next day I said to my friend, ""Do you have anything to tell me? I will listen better now."" I learned that I should listen to what people have to say before I talk; that will get our friendship to the next level."
369	18248	7	3	Patience is the key to life, some people say. I don’t really know if it is or not, but I understand its value. Patience is when you are quiet and can wait calmly for things. It is when you can do hard stuff without feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience, you can do things with ease and without difficulties. Patience is self-respecting, kind, fair, and not self-seeking. Patience is about respect, not disrespect; patience has no evil in it, and patience does not boast. Patience does not lie; it makes things better when they are difficult. It makes it easier to focus and to do things better. It helps you to wait calmly for things you want or need in life.
370	18249	7	3	When I think of being patient, I think about the time I went to southrend @LOCATION1 for a hockey tournament. We were on the road for @NUM1 and a half hours! While we were on the way there, I didn’t say one thing about how much longer it would take or anything, although I was on a cluttered bus with all my hockey friends watching a hockey movie. When I think of patience, I think of waiting without constantly asking, “@CAPS1 it done yet?” or “Are we there yet?” I myself don’t have the best patience. For example, when I want to use the computer or to ride the guard or farwheeler and someone else is using those things, I tend to ask “When will he be done!” a lot. Patience grows with you as you develop; as you get older, you will be able to wait for longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long—even taking this test requires patience
371	18250	7	3	It all started on a cold and snowy @DATE1, there was only two days till @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of the rainbows, shining brightly on the houses and trees. Also people are very happy around this time of year, smiling and laughing more. I always become impatient waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. This year I was going to be patient. @CAPS4 I started being patient by going with my mom to go buy new light @CAPS1 tree, and to buy presents for my family like a new scarf for my dad. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store, all busy with their own carts. @CAPS4 when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line, and it was moving very slowly. My mom told me too be patient, @CAPS4 I did, taking a deep breath. When we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow up @LOCATION1 which was taking a very long time to inflate, but I had to be patient. Finally it @CAPS6 to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough into star shapes and put them into the hot oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook and turn golden. My mom said as patient can. ''@CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies were eventually all fasted with sprinkles on them, looking perfect. With everything made and put up we were ready for @CAPS1. ''@CAPS6 on @CAPS1,'' I said to myself. I need to be patient or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS10 everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got their presents I bought them, which made them smile. As everyone left I walked to my room not remembering that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10, the very day I had waited for. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: @CAPS13 I was patient and it payed off, making the celebration even sweeter.
372	18251	7	3	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant of delays. I was patien when I whent to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, a very popular and crowded place. When I whent to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I had to wait in a long, winding line just to get inside. I didnít have to wait for that long but I had for wait , I didnít like it, but I was patein and did not complain. It was worth the wait because the rides were so much fun. I had to wait in line for food to there was a lot of people in line there, all hungry just like me. That was worth the wait too, a welcome reward for my calmness. There food was good, the hot dogs and fries were delicious. That is how I use my lifeskill of patience, by staying calm when things take time. Patience is a good life skill to practice and it makes difficult situations easier to handle.
373	18252	7	3	One time. My cousin in patient because she was going to the mouie @CAPS1 a party later that evening. @CAPS1 it was a lot of kids at her house @CAPS1 she had to clean up the house before her mom come home from work. Also @CAPS2 that day she called our entire mom but they didnít pick up the phone, @CAPS2 she hurry up @CAPS1 tried to clean before he boyfriend came over to pick her up. Then she hurry up @CAPS1 get in the tub then got out put the the kids @CAPS1 the  tub to wash them quickly. She still had to clean up the living room then she us what to clean up the kitchen. @CAPS2 she rush out the @CAPS1 left us there while go get us something to eat from the store, @CAPS2 we clean up while she was gone, working together. Then she called me and said. I ëm on my way with food I said oh, okay. Next her boyfriend came @CAPS1 he ready to go, waiting in the car. She came back the house was clean and tidy. Then her mom came home @CAPS2 went in the room in change he clothe s her mom said where a going. She said to the mouie and a party her moma said no you not go clean up the bathroom first she got mad and said moma   I been in  patien all day I ëm ready to go. @CAPS2 she wash it go @CAPS1 cleaning the bathroom quickly, and then they left for their evening out.
374	18253	7	3	Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant, able to wait calmly without getting upset. Well Iím going to tell you about someone who is patience. My friend @PERSON1 is very patience person, always calm and composed. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her wait she listens and waits without interrupting them. When her parents were talking about important matters, and when she was trying to tell them something they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when there talking, she simply nodded and waited for her turn to speak. @PERSON1 is a very patience person and this makes her a wonderful friend to have.
375	18254	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming up in just a week. I wanted my party to come sooner, thinking about the cake and games. But my parents kept saying no, that I had to wait for the actual day. @CAPS1 the party finally came I got all my presentsí exept the ones from my parents, which were the biggest. They said @CAPS1 everyone left they would give them to me, as a special surprise. But no one left till ten o'clock at night, which felt very late. So I fell asleep on the couch waiting. When I wook up no one was up, the house was quiet. So I still had to wait, which was frustrating. (I hate waiting.) @CAPS1 my mum got up I asked if I could open my presents she said wait till your father gets up, so we could all be together. @CAPS1 my dad finally got up (@NUM1) I finally got to open my presents, tearing the paper with excitement. It was worth the wait because the new bicycle was exactly what I wanted.
376	18255	7	3	I awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort of hazy morning. It was six o'clock, and my mom was on time preparing breakfast. I was in a hurry to get going. Today was the day that the x-box 360 came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running errands I could get it. As an hour past we arrived at the grocery store. I darted inside and grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any signs of being impatient. After what seemed like hours we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn’t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quietly. It was already dark when we finally went to best buy to buy the x-box 360. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day.
377	18256	7	3	This summer I went to Florida, but the part everyone forgets is the five hour plane ride. We were in a group of three families, all my friends. When we boarded the plane we were so excited, but our group was scattered all over. So I sat with my two favorite friends on that trip. We were all loaded with electronics and games. As we took off I thought the flight was going to be a breeze, but I thought wrong. At first it was fine we talked and played games on our iPods and such, but after like two hours we started getting itchy and our iPods died. So then we decided to watch a movie on our mini DVD player. It was starting to run low on battery and the plane was broken. The thing died and we still had like another two hours and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat there was a tv so we forced it on, but it was one of those that did not work properly. We started to see really fuzzy pictures and it was getting late. We didn't know what to do; it was hopeless. We had to sit and wait it out; it was a true test of patience. We felt like three hours from home; it was the longest three hours ever. We did nothing. But as we landed we bolted out of our seats and into the air; the ride was over. We didn't have to be patient no longer.
378	18257	7	3	Patience for me is hard but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didn’t have my physical. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and two other people were sitting and watching for two hours!!! I wasn’t very patient then but later on at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctors office thingy, so I could get my physical done. So me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paper work because she didn’t make me an appointment. So that took about fifteen min. then we waited, and waited, and waited until four o'clock and if you add that up this was two hours waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient but my mom definitely wasn’t. So finally they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for fifteen min. then finally they gave us the paper/ physical, and then we left. Practice ended at five and we didn’t get home until six!!! That is a time I was patient.
379	18258	7	3	Once I was patient, I wanted to go play football with my dad but he didn’t want to. So when he was putting his shoe on I would ask him to come play football and he would take his shoe off. Then I had to wait two and half hour just for him to get one shoe on. When he was putting the second shoe on I didn’t say anything so he finished. We finally went and played football. That’s how I learned if you use your patience you will be able to do some things.
380	18259	7	3	A time when someone showed patience was my mom when I wrote on the wall. She was very mad at me so then my sister said she did it too. So my mom had her patience and listened to what we had to say. Then she said y'all are in a lot of trouble because we know better, she said, but we still had to clean everything for a week. But she was very patient with us and that's how someone that I know showed patience.
381	18260	7	3	Patience is a sense of tolerance. Having the patience means that you can wait calmly, with the belief that it will come to you if you just wait. It is like when you gobble your food down thinking it's going to be stolen, when really, you could have left it there and yet it would still be there. Patience involves knowing that everything is going to be ok and that you have the necessary time. Having patience to do something, therefore, is to take your time, or go at your own pace while believing you will finish. Patience is generally about how long you can wait to do something, or even put up with something difficult. Patience could also mean how long you can endure something, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun of you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before you're just pushed off the edge and you can't take it any more! That is what patience is.
382	18261	7	3	“Hey PERSON1, it’s PERSON3, how are you?” “I’m good, what’s up? Anyway, I'm calling you to ask, if you wanna go to the amusement park with me?” “Oh yah!” “I haven’t gone in a long time! Hold on, lemme ask my mom.” “Okay.” As I explained to her what is happening, she agreed. “Okay, my grandma’s gonna come pick you up.” “What time?” “About one o’clock!” “Okay, see yah then! Bye!! (Can you come) help us pack the cooler?” “Sure.” (A knock and the doorbell rings) I fling it open. “Grandma!” “Hello, I missed you so much!” “Hi!” For two hours straight we played guitar hero until we both passed out. “Alright girls, time to get ready.” “We are up, Mom!” We all got ready and we got on the freeway. PERSON1 and I took goofy pictures, and my sister fell asleep with Grandma sleeping on me. I closed my eyes, and when I opened them, we had stopped so we could all tell PERSON3 we were going to the amusement park! I look at my mum, “Are you kidding me?” “No,” she said, “the family’s going.” “The whole family?” “No, just PERSON2, PERSON4, you and me are going!” “What about my friend?” “Sorry, she can’t go; she has to work.” “That really does suck, Mom.” “Don’t I know it.” “So when are we going?” “We’re leaving on Saturday and coming back that same day.” “We’re not staying the night?” “No, we can’t afford it!” “Then how did you get the amusement park tickets?” “I won them on a radio station.” “That’s so cool!” “Am I allowed to bring someone?” “Like who?” “I was thinking maybe my friend, can I call and ask her if she can come?” “The phone is right here!” As I scroll through my mom’s phone, trying to find my friend’s phone number, I hit the send button and it dials. “Hello?” “Hi, this is PERSON3, is my friend there?” “Yes, just one second (Honey, it's for you!) (Telephone is passed) “Hello?”.
383	18262	7	3	The time when I showed patience is when I was having to go down a waterslide. It all started when I was in Wisconsin Dells. I wanted to go swimming at a place called the Kalahari. The place was so big, you could fit a thousand people in it. The time I was patient is when I was going up the stairs to the slide when everybody rushed in front of me just to go down the two slides. So I waited about fifteen minutes just to go on the fun slide. The reason it took me so long is because you have to walk up two flights of stairs within the enclosed tower. So the second time I went up, I ran up the stairs so I could be the first one, so I did and I still had to wait because there were still people there from the last time. So I waited my turn calmly. That is the time I showed patient endurance.
384	18263	7	3	When I was patient I was in line at Cedar Point for the Millennium Force. We got to Cedar Point late so we went to the end of the line. There was a sign halfway through that said “your wait will be one hour.” So we stood in line for an hour, and finally we got to the front. I was so excited. As I was walking up the stairs to board the ride, I realized I just awaited an hour and fifteen minutes for this moment, and then I rode it. The ride was incredibly fast and thrilling, making the long wait feel completely worthwhile in the end.
385	18264	7	3	"A Time I was patient was the time my mom and I went to the doctor two hours early. After we walked up to the front desk panting from running because we thought we were late, the receptionist said ""Are you ok!"" I said ""Yes, am I late for the appointment for Joyce""! ""Woah, you're two hours early,"" she said. ""Mom, you pulled me out of my two favorite hours in school to be two hours early""! I said ""Sorry, would you like me to take you back to school?"" ""No, I'm good,"" I replied. So we waited in the lobby and I was fine with it because I had the new West Coast video game and a stress ball to play with. I just played that until I got bored of it, then I read some weird adult magazine. By the way, I was only eight when this happened and now I'm almost thirteen. Then the doctor walked out and I got my shots. That was the time I was patient the most and for the longest duration."
386	18265	7	3	One day, I was at the store with my sister and my mom. The place was packed, and there were people cutting in line, running into each other, and yelling “get out of my way”. That rude behavior made me mad, and I could tell it bothered everyone else too, but like every one else I was not yelling at the overwhelmed workers. It was almost Christmas, and I finally seen why every one was getting so mad and impatient. We were all just trying to mind our own business and finish our shopping. But for some reason, people just dust made everyone else mad with their hurried actions, so that’s when patience came in. We all had to take a deep breath and wait our turn. After all, we eventually got out of the store and went home. That’s why you should have patience in crowded situations.
387	18266	7	3	One day me and my brother went hunting at Whispering Oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk through the quiet woods. When we got set up in our blind, the hunt began. We waited patiently but we didn’t see anything for a long time, but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flock of turkeys wandering around like penguins in the distance. Their feathers started to lose their color in the dim morning light. And as they walked closer the males' beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about ten minutes they probably caught our scent and ran away into the underbrush. After that we knew the deer would likely not come out but we were wrong, about twenty minutes later we saw a deer moving cautiously. And we watched it till it came to shooting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were more deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a good-sized buck. So we watched them as they came closer like a storm getting closer and closer, step by step. So my brother drew back his bow slowly. He held his bow back for over three minutes he almost looked like a statue, completely still. And my brother waited for it to turn around because its head was facing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bullet coming out of a gun, swift and silent. The arrow didn’t hit him; it went about a foot away from the deer, kicking up leaves. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran off instantly. We waited a while longer to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any, so my brother and I cleaned up our blind, gathering our gear. And we luged everything back to the car, tired but content. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door, eager for news. But we told them that we didn’t get one this time. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie together.
388	18267	7	3	Patience can really help you in life; some times it’s the only thing that can keep us sane during difficult moments. Patience is important and can make hard situations easier to bear. Just like how my dog ran away and I’m waiting for her to come back, hoping she finds her way home. Sometimes you'll get in a situation were your waiting for someone or something, but there is always only one real choice, to wait or be patient and trust that things will work out in time. It is a valuable quality to develop.
389	18268	7	3	I like building a house or working on a puzzle. Becouse it takes time to do puzzles and it takes dedication, hard work, and patients to complet a house from the foundation up. If you have no patients then it is harder to complet such big projects when you just get board of it or frustrated. Rushing only leads to mistakes, so taking your time is the best approach for a good result.
390	18269	7	3	My dad is a very patient person. He’s known to be patient by everyone in our family. Here is a clear example, with his camera. He waited a whole five years just to get one specific lense for it, saving up and searching. Because he was patient, he finally got what he wanted. My mom is very patient as well. My mom is patient too, in her own way. She waited a whole month just for a special pair of slippers she ordered, because she was patient and didn’t mind the delay. I’m proud to have such patient parents, who teach me by example. Which means that I know they are very responsible and calm, and that is what I think being patient is all about.
391	18271	7	3	When my brother, my dad, and my two cousins finally got out of the car after the long @NUM1-hour drive from @LOCATION1, we immediately knew we were going to have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw it all at Cedar Point, the amazing amusement park. In the car, we had talked excitedly about the famous @CAPS1, listing them off: The Maverick, Millennium Force, the @NUM2, the @CAPS2, and the Mantis. When I walked through the gates, I knew this day was going to be fun. Right as we entered, we saw the massive @CAPS2, but the line was already huge, so we decided to come back later. As the day went on, we managed to go on almost all of the major @CAPS1. Later, as we approached the towering @CAPS4, we saw at least @NUM3 people in the winding line, which meant there went our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we finally circled back to the @CAPS2, the line was even bigger than it had been at the start of the day. We discussed it and decided the line wasn't getting any smaller, so we joined it. About an hour later, a @NUM4-year-old guy was in line with his mom. On the back of his shirt was a cool fish design, so my cousin asked him what it was. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for a good half an hour until we finally got on the ride. The ride itself was absolutely amazing and truly deserved the long wait. This experience taught me how to be patient and showed me that waiting often leads up to good things.
392	18272	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 and my cousin. I had to babysit my cousin, @CAPS2, while his room was being packed up because they were moving back to @LOCATION2. My cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way, which can be challenging. But I was patient and waited until the trip was over before I complained to my mom. Me and my cousin got into lots of fights on that vacation, as we often did. But I still love him dearly, of course. I had to be very patient with my cousin and even, maybe, do what he wanted, but I knew his mom was very proud of me for handling it. I remember one specific instance when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators. But then @CAPS2 decided he wanted to go to the park instead. I knew I had to give in, considering that he's only @NUM1 and still quite immature. But I just went with the flow, and we went to the park. That was a time that I truly had to be patient.
393	18273	7	3	Patience is something not everybody has. In order for someone to be patient, you have to understand and tolerate things that might be very hard or annoying. I am one of those people who has learned this. Patience is a sort of a gift, a valuable one. It takes time to develop patience, and you can not always be in a hurry for everything. For example, one time I heard someone talking in my basement. It was a strange noise, so I went down there to see who was in my house. As I was walking, I heard soft giggling and a sense of excitement. I kept on walking cautiously until I pinpointed the voices coming from behind a closed door. I went to open it, and I saw all kinds of wrapped gifts and I saw two people, my mom and my dad. They hurried up and closed the door quickly and told me to go up stairs immediately. So I ran up stairs to tell my brothers what I had just seen. They were all excited and everything, buzzing with questions. The next day went by slowly, and I could not wait until @CAPS2, which was the next day. So I waited, practicing the patience I was learning.
394	18275	7	3	@PERSON1 wanted a dog. She really did. She had been asking her @CAPS1 for a while now, pleading her case. Every time she would ask her @CAPS1, the reply would always be, “You can’t get a dog until you earn it.” @PERSON1 didn’t know how to earn it; she thought about it for a while but didn’t really know what her @CAPS1 meant. She figured that her @CAPS1 meant that she needed to show her some responsibility first. She looked at the clock; it said @NUM1, almost time for dinner. She thought her @CAPS1 was probably working on it, so she walked out into the kitchen and there was her @CAPS1 making dinner. @PERSON1 asked a little more than loud, “what’s for dinner?” It was steak and mashed potatoes. That was @PERSON1’s favorite meal. She nodded and said, “Can I help!” “Why not?” her @CAPS1 questioned. @PERSON1 asked her what she could do, and her @CAPS1 said to get the salt and pepper to put on the cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 felt pretty happy that @PERSON1 was willing to help out. @PERSON1 did what she could, then went upstairs to her room, hoping her @CAPS1 would get the message. She ate dinner with her @CAPS1 and then she went to bed. The next day she ran down the stairs to find her @CAPS1 sitting on the coach. She said quickly, “what are we doing today?” Her @CAPS1 answered, “I was thinking we could just hang around the house.” @PERSON1 was getting impatient; she wanted a dog and she was trying her best to be good. Then finally she lost it and shouted, “are we ever gonna get a dog???” Her @CAPS1, surprised by @PERSON1's outburst, said, “well……” @PERSON1 interrupted, “@CAPS1 I REALLY WANT ONE AND I PROMISE I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT FOR YOU!” Her @CAPS1 answered, “Well, if you were more patient, I was gonna say maybe we could go look at one.” @PERSON1 felt bad for yelling and realised things will turn out better if she waits. Later that day, her and her @CAPS1 went out and had a great day together.
395	18276	7	3	The time I was patient was when my sister dropped my phone in Kool-Aid. I was really upset, but I was going to get a new one, depending entirely on my behavior. That meant I had to be extra good and patient, which was a real test. Everyday for the rest of that week, I was on my best behavior. I still didn't get a new phone, so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well, since it was her fault, she had offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I just had to be patient. Another whole week went by, and I was starting to become very impatient, but I held my tongue and didn't complain. Then, the next day, my sister surprised me and took me into the Metro PCS store to pick out a new phone. See, by being patient, I finally got a new phone, and that is the time I was truly patient.
396	18277	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient especially when it is all sold out. For example, when I was waiting in line for a shirt, the line was really long and moved very slowly, so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patience because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and there were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts, so I had to wait for what felt like forever. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many other ways we had to be patient, like finding a parking spot in the crowded lot and then slowly making our way to our seats through the thick crowds. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break, I went to get a pop and discovered all the concession lines were incredibly long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min, waiting to get my pop and also my cousin's fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and hurried back, only to realize I had forgotten my own pop on the counter, but luckily the vendor saw me and gave me a new one just in case that wasn't mine. I went back, drank my pop, and watched the show. Everything takes patience and when you wait you get everything you need in the end. This is a time I had to be patient.
397	18278	7	3	Being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey. It has to stay perfectly still and silent, blending into the tall grass, to get its prey. It has to be patient too, watching and waiting for the perfect moment without moving a muscle. Then after it gets into the right position, it pauses, every muscle coiled and ready. The cat gets its goal by being patient, demonstrating that success often comes to those who can wait calmly for the right opportunity to arise.
398	18279	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room, and the energy was intense. I worked very hard and felt I did my best when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited anxiously at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didn’t get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldn’t get anything, that all my hard work had been for nothing. One day when I had given up all hope, a thin letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited with a heavy heart until dance started, and my teacher pulled me aside to tell me that there had been a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I, a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for the correction to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don’t give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them successfully.
399	18280	7	3	One time I went to the doctors for a check-up. The doctor said to wait in this small, plain room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said another doctor will come in to see us shortly. We waited three long, boring hours in that room, with nothing to do but read old magazines. My mom was getting mad, muttering that they must have forgotten about us. It turned out the doctor that was supposed to come in had gone into the wrong room by mistake. The worst part was I had to get three shots at the very end of the visit, and I hate shots. In conclusion, I learned my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the doctors for being good, so patience always has a reward, even if it's just a sweet treat.
400	18281	7	3	"There goes another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, I thought that I should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria as fast as I could. I sped past a sea of seventh graders all urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought impatiently. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my senses and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""@CAPS6 is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun, which would take more time. I bailed to the other line in frustration. I gripped the tongs with disappointment and put some chips and cheese on my plate. At least I had some food to eat! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave me a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience and for not causing a fuss. ""I got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11"" I thought, my mood instantly improving. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometimes you @MONTH1 get rewarded with a pleasant surprise!"
401	18282	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to wait in the emergency room after I broke my foot. I was waiting for about an hour and a half, and it was really boring because it seemed like everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient; my mom and I just sat on the stiff, uncomfortable chairs for the entire hour and a half. Finally, the nurse called my name, so I went in, and then we had to wait for the doctor to come into the small examination room, and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know was how I had broken my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of soft cloth on it, then they put like two layers of the wet, plaster cast thing on, and then I had to wait for it to dry and harden. So having patience can be hard sometimes, but everybody can learn to have patience when they need to.
402	18283	7	3	One day not very long ago, my brother, Alex, had homework troubles. And yes, this is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night, mostly math. One day he needed help, and I had said, “On what?” He said, “My math homework; it’s just too long and I can’t do it.” Honestly, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney “I need help.” So I helped him. It took a lot of patience, and I was very patient, for him to take an hour long. I checked over his work while him and my mom had a fight about his attitude. Oh, and Alex took a shower too in the middle of it all. It turned out he got, um, one, two, three, no, just two answers right. While I patiently waited for him to get out of the shower, I got a separate piece of paper, copied down the problems, answered them, and got them all right. When Alex gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills, I helped him understand his mistakes. At student-led conferences I saw he got an A on that assignment. What a happy ending for a patience-filled paper.
403	18284	7	3	Patience is a lot of things and is used every day. You can be waiting for a check in the mail, or you could wait for an important letter. Sometimes patience can be fast or it can be very slow. It can be used in school or even at a job. If you wait in patience on standing in line, good things could happen to you. For a test, you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a difficult question to come to you, by waiting a little longer to get the answer right instead of going too fast and not getting it right. Patience can be used in science class during experiments. It could also be used in math to carefully find an answer. When you are building a model, you have to use patience so it is put together correctly; not having patience means it will be wrong and fall apart. That is what patience means to me, and everyone has to use it because it is part of your daily life and helps you succeed.
404	18285	7	3	Patience is a very important value. To succeed, you truly need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self-centered, and poorly trained from her previous owner. I had to teach her new moves at a slow, consistent pace so she could remember how she was supposed to do them correctly. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to her present home and didn’t recognize the new surroundings, which made her nervous and sometimes unwilling to cooperate. These, though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life, teaching me that good results often require a calm and steady approach.
405	18286	7	3	Sixty-nine days ago, thirty-three miners in Chile got stuck underground after a mine collapse. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface, with very little food or light. Now, they are safe and sound at home with their families. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant, even during great difficulty. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panic or blame each other; they worked together and waited calmly till someone could help them. Then, after they had been found, the miners had been told they would get out of the hole around Christmas. Even though Christmas was four months away, none of the miners complained or yelled in frustration. They all understood the immense difficulty of the rescue operation. Thankfully, all the miners came out safely ahead of schedule. This all took incredible patience in order to work out for the best. It took over twenty-two and a half hours to rescue all thirty-three miners, one by one, in a small capsule.
406	18287	7	3	"On our way to @CAPS1 point, I was screaming in my head. It was so crazy! We had just driven in from Lake Erie. I could see it! The destination was right there, within easy walking distance. Oh my gosh, we pulled up into the parking lot and walked all the way to the stamp station. We got our stamps and then we walked up to the metal bars, but we had to stop because a security guard said ""no."" We found out the park only opened at ten, so we had to wait. We waited and waited and waited, and more and more people came. Soon it got really crowded as even more people arrived. Me and my cousins, @PERSON1 and @CAPS2, all went to go play Phase Ten to pass the time, and we had to wait in a line for that, too. Finally, at @NUM1, it was time to get into the park. We all crowded up to the fence and then ran inside as fast as we could. We went and got in line for the Raptor for @NUM2 minutes. Man, what a long line that was, but hey, it was so worth the wait. And yes, I learned that patience helps ""a lot."""
407	18288	7	3	"It was @DATE1, my brother's birthday. He turned @NUM2, and he was making me mad because he kept asking my mom for stuff, and she kept saying she didn't have it. Then he would ask my other brother, who would be like, ""You know I got this money for my baby."" So he just kept asking different people, and it was really getting on my nerves because when somebody says they don't have something, they don't have it. I didn't say anything; I was quiet because it was his special day, but I know how to be patient when it's something important or special. So I just kept watching him and watching him, and then I finally said, ""Here, you can have my money; it is your birthday, so here you go."" So I gave him what he was angrily asking for, and he finally got it. I had practiced patience because I didn't go off on him, since it was his birthday, and in the end, I gave him what he wanted."
408	18289	7	3	"A time when I was patient was the day I had an asthma attack. I was very scared, and worst of all, my inhaler was broken, which is not good. So my mom rushed @CAPS2 to the doctor's office. The doctor gave @CAPS2 a breathing machine treatment, and then I started to feel fine. @CAPS1 gave @CAPS2 a prescription and said, ""Use this whenever you feel like you can't breathe again."" I said, ""Okay."" @CAPS2 and my mom went to @ORGANIZATION1 and dropped the prescription off, and we said we would come back in one hour. I went home and fell asleep, then my mom woke @CAPS2 up and said we had to go pick that medicine up. So we went back to @ORGANIZATION1, and they said, ""Hold on one moment, please."" ""Okay,"" said my mom. We sat in the car for another full hour, just waiting and waiting and waiting. I was very patient, but my two little sisters were crying because they wanted to go home. That day my mom was impatient, which is not good, so she was getting mad. The worker finally said, ""@CAPS3, your order is ready, sorry for the wait."" My mom paid for it, and then we left. That entire day, I was very patient."
409	18290	7	3	A time I was patient was when my family and I went to West Virginia. We had to wake up very early to get on the road so we wouldn't have to sit in traffic. So we were on the road, and when we got there, they had a nice house for us to stay in. But later, we had to wait in a very long line just to get into a popular restaurant. It took them @NUM1 minutes just to get us a table and seat us. We finally had a happy dinner together after all that waiting. That was a time when I was patient with my family.
410	18291	7	3	What is patience? Patience is the act of understanding, tolerating, and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1, was born on @DATE1. Since his birth, my mother has dreaded the day of potty training, which she knew would be coming soon. As you know, the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive, so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years old, she started potty training him. Potty training requires a lot of patience because sometimes the child will not go to the potty and will instead go on himself. My mom knows this, but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all new to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient, but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be old enough to use the bathroom on the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient and waiting for the results.
411	18292	7	3	Two years ago my dad had surgery on his leg because he broke it at work. I had to sit in a waiting room for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do. The room was quiet and the air felt still, making the time pass even slower. Every two hours my mom, grandma, grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch our legs and get some fresh air, which provided a brief respite from the monotony. After about four hours I got really tired, my back began to ache from the hard seat, but I didn’t fall asleep. That was the longest I’ve sat in one place my entire life. At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half; it only seemed like two, but the growing stiffness in my body was a constant reminder of the actual time that had passed.
412	18293	7	3	I am patient in a lot of stuff. For instance, when I play a board game I am patient, and when I take a difficult test I am also patient. I am almost patient in everything I do. Lots of people are patient too, which makes activities more enjoyable. On the other hand, some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer, they're not patient. They just want to immediately take the ball and score, often disrupting our team's strategy. One time I was playing at the park with my friends; I was playing soccer and my friend loudly told me to pass the ball to him right that second. He was not patient at all that day, and his rushing ultimately caused us to lose possession of the ball.
413	18294	7	3	Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even face a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused and hasty mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you’re quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching your goal(s). In situations such as sports games, arguments, disasters, and many other occurrences, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you’re waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren’t doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute plays smoothly, and by respectfully sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to calmly sort out all the things that you’ve lost, and you’ll be enabled to think clearly about what has just happened. I’ve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a difficult situation. Overall, I guess what I’m trying to say is that when you’re patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you may not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn’t a “bundle of roses” all the time, so sooner or later, you’re going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn’t human nature but it’s indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the vast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives. I’m certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait; no, we simply need to learn it patiently.
414	18295	7	3	One day we were in a long line at Cedar Point for the Speed Racer roller coaster. We had to wait for what seemed like forever, the line inching forward at a painfully slow pace. I was losing my patience, so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot in line. I was standing there waiting for him when someone told a security guard we had left, and the guard took us all the way back to the very end of the line. We were mad, and my dad was losing his patience too after that frustrating setback. We waited for hours more, the sun beating down on us, till it was finally our turn to board. We waited that incredibly long time and the ride itself was over in just a couple of minutes. As we walked away, we all said we would never go back to that particular ride again. That was a time I lost my patience, and it certainly taught me a lesson about the frustrations that can come from impatience.
415	18296	7	3	The time I was patient with my little brothers was when I was baby sitting them. They wouldn’t listen to me or my other sister, running around the house and refusing to clean up their toys. I started to feel frustrated, but then I just relaxed and decided to change my approach. I got down on the floor and started playing with them, building a tower with their blocks. After that, their moods changed and all went well for the rest of the evening.
416	18297	7	3	"Do you ever feel like your head is going to explode? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how I felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that I want to explode. The story starts at three pm; my brother from work just got off and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by himself, so I was going to surprise him by walking home with him. I just passed the high school and I heard my name being called, so I looked around and I heard my name being called again. The voice kept calling, so I stopped, and my sister Sarah, and my friend Savannah came up from behind me and stopped. Sarah said ""I didn't want you to walk to get our brother by yourself,"" so we kept walking. Savannah and I kept switching on the scooter, and it got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding. We stopped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again, and then we called our brother and said we didn't see him and it was already late; he said he's at his friend's house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died. We kept holding the power reset button but nothing happened, so I ran home to get the bike. There was sweat running down my face and it wouldn't stop; my legs were numb. As soon as I got to the house my legs collapsed. I got up and put shorts on, grabbed the bike and ran out the door. Sarah and Savannah were already at the party store; Savannah questioned me and asked ""Why did it take you so long?"" I told her what happened as Sarah pushed the scooter and Savannah rode on the handle bars. In my head I was thinking about how long it took me to get there and how mad I was that they came and how I thought I was going to explode because the scooter died. We put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and dropped. The lesson learned is don't do something unless you're for sure it's happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again."
417	18298	7	3	When my family went to Mackinac we had to wait to get on the boat. We were patient because we had to wait to get on the ferry boat. We had to wait at least thirty minutes for the boat to arrive and for the line to move forward. My little brother did not start being an obnoxious four year old; he just waited quietly in line with the rest of us. When we finally got there we rode around the island on a rented bike, which was very enjoyable. Then we did what he wanted to do, which was look for rocks by the shore. While we did that, I was patient and did not complain. Overall, I think that the trip went pretty good, because everybody was patient and we all had a nice time together.
418	18300	7	3	I have to be very patient for a while because my sister is going to have her sweet sixteenth birthday in October. So it is kinda hard for me to be patient about that because my mom and my sister are planning so much at one time. It gets hard for me to relax while they go out and get stuff for the party, and on top of that we are taking a trip to Florida before her birthday. So we have a lot of planning to do in a month and a half. It’s very hard, but I have to be patient. I have to watch my mom successfully plan a party and still be able to focus on the trip to Florida with my family. All my life, I have lived learning about being patient, but it is a challenge I must try to overcome every single day.
419	18301	7	3	My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctor's office. It was a very long day. At first we went in and it took a full hour just for her to get called into an examination room. She finally did get in and I was just sitting in the waiting room by myself. I would see people come in and then go out after their appointments. I saw about fifteen people do that while I just waited. I sat and read old magazines while I was waiting, and she finally came out after what felt like forever. When she was done, the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day that truly tested my ability to wait calmly.
420	18302	7	3	"One day when the new video game console came out I wanted it so bad, so I asked my mom and she said maybe for my birthday, and guess what, my birthday was coming up. It was only March and I couldn’t wait, so I went to school and I got it over with every day. I kept coming home and saying, ""I’m for sure that I will get that console, just like Mom said,"" and that was about the hundredth time I said that to her. She said, ""You have to be patient or I will probably never even get it for you because you have a little brother around, and if he hears you saying 'I want this and that' he’s going to think Santa is not real, so be patient."" Well, for the past few days I started being patient. I had to be patient for a while because it was only April too, and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time, but I didn’t care because I was about to get a new console, so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. Well, I know one thing, I am lucky for not asking for a console for the past few days; I’m being patient and I really can’t believe it. I really never been patient anytime except for now when I’m getting something awesome. So now I have only five more days until my birthday, so I’m really excited. I was on a birthday countdown break on the last five days, so I played video games to save up my time of being patient. Then the last three days I’ve been playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there were only two more days until my birthday and I just played outside until the day was over; on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on my birthday eve. Then the day finally came, my birthday! Finally I saw my presents and my mom said, ""Go on, open them."" I started to open them and once I opened all my presents I did not see the console, until my mom gave me one present that she was holding back, and it was the console. Finally I got it, so now I don’t have to be patient no more."
421	18303	7	3	A few days ago a kid named Leo was having a problem. This problem is something he would like to keep to himself. He felt like this problem was going to end him. His problem was that he had to go to the dentist!!! Leo hated the fact that they drill into your teeth. He also hates the smell of the dentist office, that sharp, clinical scent. Leo had to go in three days and he was even more scared because he's going by himself this time. He then realized that he can't be such a baby so he decided to be patient. He easily waited through the whole two days and then the day came. He woke up and he rode his bike down to the dentist's office and then he waited a short period of time in the quiet lobby before he had to go back to the room where the dentist gives you your check up. He decided to close his eyes and be patient, focusing only on his breathing. After it was over he went home and was relieved that his patience was there when he needed it.
422	18304	7	3	Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is still patient at some point. Some people learn how to have good patience by learning from an elder or some model figure in their life. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood, which is not an easy task. Having patience is a good thing to have because you will for sure be good with kids of all ages and you will work very well with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening and with showing respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that child so they learn to listen. If someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it will take patience to work with them so they can learn to have good respect! In summary patience is one key element to a successful life.
423	18305	7	3	I remember when I was at Lucky Steak House and the hostess lady said we have to wait a half hour before we can sit down. I thought I was going to die of hunger but my mom said to be patient and wait quietly. So about twenty minutes left I was about to scream from boredom but I just sat on my chair waiting and didn't say a word. But I waited excitedly and was bored out of my mind. Ten minutes left and I am about to explode because I want to eat so badly but I can't, yet I still didn't do anything and did not talk as I went to the bathroom. Five minutes left and I am calming down and about ready to eat, still didn't say anything or do any thing. Then they finally called our name and we could go eat and I was so happy; then we ordered and a few minutes later our food comes out and that was the most patient I have ever been in my entire life.
424	18306	7	3	Patience is hard for example when you walk in to a doctor’s office you must patiently wait your turn to see the doctor. Patience is just another word for “wait”; you have to be willing to wait to see the doctor. But instead most people say can't you patiently wait to see the doctor? But instead most people say can't you “please wait to see the doctor. Patience is hard for some people to manage. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a doctor for their appointment. Another example is “are we there yet” when families go on a road trip you hear kids say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness too, well that is a sign of no patience. What so ever so what I would say if someone came up to me and said what is patience? I would simply say “wait”; wait your turn, wait for the bus, wait for the doctor, and wait for us to get there.
425	18307	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors for a checkup, my appointment was at two o'clock and we didn’t get called till two forty-five. I had to wait a long time in the crowded waiting room! Finally when we got into the doctors room the nurse did my blood pressure and checked my weight and then I had to wait another fifteen mins for the actual doctor to arrive. By the time the doctor actually came into the room it was about three o'clock. I got my flu shot and the swine flu shot, which was quick. When I was all done it was three-fifteen and I was so ready to go home. That’s a time when I was truly patient.
426	18308	7	3	Some people are completely patient. Some people aren’t patient at all. But me; I am sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patience, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she is not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient with everyone. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When it's my birthday I try to be patient and wait for the surprises. When we’re going somewhere special, or I’m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It’s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can’t always be patient, is that sometimes I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool over small things. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, like when I’m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I’m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something you're natural with, like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn’t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don’t have patience in school or with your friends. You won't be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don’t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids or teenagers aren’t always patient either. I think we should just try to be as patient as we can, all the time, because it makes everything a little bit easier.
427	18309	7	3	Patience is not fun but it is sometimes necessary. I'm going to tell you how patience is not fun. It was a calm day at school. I was waiting for the bell to ring, my heart beating fast. My friend @CAPS1 was going to finally give me an answer to my question. The question was do you love me? I couldn’t stop thinking about it all day long. Ring! Ring! Ring! Finally I could see @CAPS1 and as excited as I was I rushed out the door. I went to his locker and he gave me a note, so I read it quickly. It said possibly maybe I like you. I was so happy and relieved. Patience is not fun, but I got an answer to my question in the end. Next time you have to be patient just think good things come to those who wait, and it will be worth it.
428	18310	7	3	In some point you have to be patient. If you are in a long line you need to be patient. You have to be patient waiting for a share to part, or for your turn to come. You have to be patient if something is coming in the mail and you can't wait to see what it is, or you know what it is and you just can’t run to get it right away. When you go to the store and you see something you want and have your mom or dad say they will get it for your birthday, then you can not wait for your birthday to arrive. Well I have been there many times. I love Christmas because you get almost everything you want, but you have to wait for it. When you get to do something you have been wanting forever, like going somewhere for the first time, you feel so excited. All of these things require you to be patient, and that is just a part of life.
429	18311	7	3	This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, I guess. There’s grief for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair, staring at nothing. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on; I need someone to love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sometimes. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3, who disappeared three weeks after I met him. He’s gone and hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park, on our bench. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello from someone who will stay.
430	18312	7	3	Being patient means that you're understanding and tolerant, and I have been patient too. When I went fishing I had never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing for hours. Not complaining, not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just watch as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself whenever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient and kept trying. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish one day and I believed him. When I turned nine I went to a friend’s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and reels. I didn’t have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something big’s tail come out of the water near my hook. All of a sudden a tremendous tug on the line almost threw me into the water. I reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn’t break. Finally I held the fish high over my head in a triumphant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years, and it felt amazing.
431	18314	7	3	The four sisters waited in line for the second most exciting ride of their day at Cedar Point, right behind @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. The roar of the roller coaster and the screams of its riders zoomed by, and then @CAPS14 it started to get quite again. “I am so super, doper excited!” @CAPS4 the youngest sister exclaimed, bouncing on her heels. “I know, me too,” the rest said at almost the same time. Eight eager eyes moved in unison, watching the same thrilling thing: The @CAPS5! There were twists, turns, dives, and hills involved with this serious package deal. “@CAPS6,” @CAPS10 long has it been?!” asked @PERSON3. “@CAPS7 hour,” replied @CAPS8 the oldest, @PERSON1, putting her long, dark, curly hair into a pony tail. “@CAPS9, young grasshopper,” said @PERSON4 as she patted the side of @PERSON1's face, “@CAPS10 this sun has really got to me.” “@CAPS11!” agreed @PERSON1 with a look of displeasure on her face. “@CAPS12, my guys, look! We’re almost to the front!” exclaimed the second oldest, @PERSON2. “@CAPS13 me!” said a voice coming from behind them. “@CAPS14 you for being patient, but we are experiencing some difficulty with the ride and it will be fixed as soon as we can. Thank you.” “I really hope @CAPS15 finish it soon!” said @PERSON3. They all agreed. @CAPS15 waited for about another half @CAPS7 hour before @CAPS14 another announcement came on. “@CAPS16 again thank you for being so patient but this problem will not be fixed for another @NUM1 hours. Thank you for choosing Cedar Point.” And the voice shut off and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4 decided to go ride the giant swings instead, their patience finally exhausted.
432	18317	7	3	It was the day of the central @LOCATION1 game, and after school, I was in the parade with my football team. The line was moving really slow, and eventually we were done, and it was off to home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well, he was preparing for me to come over, and I went to his house where we played a little before we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1’s, there were about @NUM1 cars, and they were all in the drive-through. We sat in the car for about half an hour, but it was lucky because the game didn’t start until @NUM2 and it was only @NUM3. So we sat there patiently, ordered our food, and finally left to go to the football game, arriving just in time. And that’s a time when I was patient, waiting without complaint for what felt like a long time.
433	18318	7	3	Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now, not later. You must stay calm and be peaceful in patience, so much so that you almost forget what you are waiting for, but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something immediately. If there's a test on @DATE1, I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't wait that long, and it gives me tension just knowing what is going to happen. If you have patience, it's almost like a gift, a rare talent just like singing and dancing, a true blessing that makes difficult situations easier to bear.
434	18319	7	3	“It’s where?” The woman asked for the third time. “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,” I said for what had to be the fiftieth time that day. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom without another word. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often don’t meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere. “@CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour,” I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue-and-white company logo of Young’s Incorporated. “@CAPS3, you’re with Young’s?” @CAPS4 asked. “Do you know where the show room is?” I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking: Why was an adolescent working for a corporation? “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,” I said in a robotic voice. “@CAPS6’t you a little young to be doing this kind of work?” @CAPS4 asked. You were expecting maybe an intern? I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent “@CAPS8, sir.” “@CAPS9 old are you?” @CAPS4 asked quizzically. “@CAPS11, sir,” I lied. I knew I could pass for a high-schooler, so I knew @CAPS4’d believe me. I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I was getting pretty edgy, already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. “Are you getting paid?” Not enough to put up with the likes of you, I thought. I took a deep breath and answered, “Yes, sir. But it’s @CAPS12 a lot. It’s more like volunteer work, really.” Please don’t ask any more questions, I thought. @CAPS4 smiled and walked on, saying, “Thanks son.” “You’re welcome,” I said through partially clenched teeth. I think we’ll both agree that I was patient that day, and I hope that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dad’s shop, because if @CAPS4 didn’t, I will be very put out. That is the time when I was the most patient I have ever been.
435	18320	7	3	Patience is when a person is patient they can wait a thousand years for an answer, or they are understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time and still keep their cool. That is truly amazing. Patience is when the person is always there when you need help, and they will give you patience just by being around them. I think a patient person is calm, doesn’t lose their temper, and helps you when you need a little boost of patience to get through a tough moment, making everything seem more manageable.
436	18321	7	3	I always have to be patient when I put way model airplanes together, carefully gluing the tiny pieces and applying the decals just right. Sometimes I have to ask my dad for help when putting together harder models. Like the intricate engines on the B-17 bombers. I also have to be patient when hunting for rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkey, sitting silently for what feels like hours. If Iím not patient I could mist a good shot or a good animal, letting a perfect opportunity walk right by. I sometimes have to patient at school with group projects and other students, waiting for my turn to speak or for a classmate to finish their work. Practicing patience in these different parts of my life has taught me that good things really do come to those who wait.
437	18322	7	3	At time when I was patient when I really wanted to go to my favorite store. That morning I woke up and I told my dad that I wanted to go to my favorite store. Happily, my dad said ìlets go.î Soon we went to the store and it said that it was closed. Disappointed, I check the hours and they were going to open in thirty minutes. So my dad and me being patients. Well mostly my dad because he did not say ìletís goî or anything, he just leaned against the car. After twenty mntues past and we had ten more minutes to wait. Finally ten minutes past and it was time, but the people that worked there said to wait about five minutes cause they had to set up things. And my dad like always nice. He waited five more minutes, then we could go in. Now finally five minutes past and we got to go inside and I was so happy. Being patient is the best thing ever. No complaining or nothing, and in the end, we got exactly what we wanted.
438	18324	7	3	It was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the summer. It was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert. ìhoney get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,î my mom shouted out the window. ìBut mom,î I questioned.îitís a supriceîshe answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where we were going. When we got there, I knew exactly where we were. Six Flags Magic Mountain. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. ìIím going to go on that new roller coaster, want to come,î I asked my mom. ìSure, sounds like fun she replied.î When we got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. ìUgh, I donít want to wait mom, its too long of a line,î I complained. ìJust be patient, sweety weíll be on the coaster in no time,î she replied. One hour laterÖÖÖ ìmom its taking forever.î I whimpered. ìWe are the next ones in line,î she replied still smiling. So when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, I couldnít believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. ìYou were very patient,î my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. ìYes I was, and Iím proud of that,î I said to myself, learning that the best rewards often require a little waiting.
439	18325	7	3	One of the most patient time I have ever had was in downtown Chicago at one of the greatest pizza places around Lou Malnati's poupules! As I my dad and friend waited at our table, we were very hungry. The delicious smells from the kitchen made our stomachs growl louder. It had been forty-five minutes scince we orderd, but I stayed patient as much as I was mad and hungry I stayed indefatigable for my food, knowing deep-dish pizza takes time to bake. Finaly it came and I was satisfied, the cheesy, hot pizza was worth every minute of the wait.
440	18326	7	3	"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things, like a slow-loading webpage or a red light that seems to last forever. I got it all from my dad, who also taps his fingers impatiently when in line. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car, honking the horn after just a minute. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them thin. I'm aware it's a flaw I need to work on, one deep breath at a time."
441	18327	7	3	I am writing a story about a time that I was patient. One day on my birthday, which was a warm summer afternoon, I was over my dad's house. My dad asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday celebration. I didn’t know at first, but then an idea came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paintball shooting. And he said ok. But before we could go, he asked if I could cut the grass for him. I agreed and said ok. So I went outside and cut the grass, which took me about an hour and thirty minutes. When I was finished, I told him I was done and he said ok. Then I took a shower because I smelled like wet grass. After I got done taking my shower, I called my friends and cousins to see if they would like to come along, and they said sure. So I asked my dad when we were going to leave to go paintball shooting. He told me that the trip was going to be on a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasn’t going to be today. They were ok with it and understood. My dad said we were going to go before the month ended, and we eventually went. And now until this day I am still being patient, remembering how waiting calmly worked out for the best.
442	18329	7	3	There are many times in a person's life when someone was being patient. Patience is a very important trait that could lead to its own rewards. I am a dancer at a local academy of dance. There is a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as challenging as a switch leap, or something as fundamental as a pirouette. Everyone who is in the class is so patient when these events happen. It might take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a single footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently without a single complaint. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak English, so they are going to have trouble learning new commands. Yelling at the dog is a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, is that not a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually, by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great and well-behaved dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and comfortability to others. Not to mention, it is what is respectful and kind. Like I said, being patient is a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it.
443	18330	7	3	Mrs. Johnson is waiting patiently when the class is talking. In the classroom, she will clap three times until they stop talking or become quiet. When they finally quiet down, she would continue teaching the lesson. When Mrs. Johnson is talking, we should be waiting patiently and quietly until she is done talking to us. We listen and do not interrupt, showing our respect. That is how Mrs. Johnson teaches us to be patient, and that is how we learn to be patient ourselves.
444	18331	7	3	PATIENT. One time I had to be very patient over at the local barrymores because we went into a long line to go on the go-karts that you had to be at least twelve years old or older to go on. The line moved very slowly, and I waited without complaining. I also had to be patient for my birthday this year because I knew I was getting cool stuff but I never imagined it would be this cool. I waited all day for my party, and when I finally opened my presents, I was so happy with the new video game console I received. It was worth the wait.
445	18332	7	3	I remember a time when my little sister used to go on and on about ice cream sundaes and all that. My mom had to drive me around all day because my dad was sick so that meant the “ice cream girl” had to come along too! My mom knew she was in for a long day. We were in the car and we drove past a Dairy Queen and that’s when my little sister decided out loud “I’m hungry I want ice cream!!!” That is what she said, yelling for five minutes straight. That’s when my mom yelled “you speak another word about ice cream and you are not getting it!” My sister then had this face that meant she was about to cry, which was even worse! My mom gave her a cookie so she would stay content for a while; we started driving home when we heard a song on the radio, my sister loves to put the word “ice cream” in every song so she started squirming while holding her tongue. She stayed that way all afternoon. She didn’t speak a word that entire day! So we drove past Dairy Queen again and then she started to cry. She had enough. “I want ice cream!!” We were messing with her, so we went back to Dairy Queen and got her the thing she wanted most: her ice cream. She was patient the entire day, she knew it was hard work. My little sister learned an important lesson that day, that being patient means good things will come to you.
446	18333	7	3	A time I was patient was when I went to get my teeth cleaned and then later that same day I went to the doctor's office. I waited for three long hours to get my teeth cleaned and that was hard, so I took a book out to read. Then when I was reading the book, about ten times I got called to get my teeth cleaned. After that, I went to the doctors to get a wellness check, my medicine refilled, and to get some special shoes. I had to wait for about two more hours before getting called into the room, but then I waited another five minutes so they could get the shots ready. So I waited about five hours and five minutes in total. After all that time, I finally went to eat some lunch at the local diner. That was all I did that day, and it truly tested my patience.
447	18334	7	3	Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your beliefs because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down and showing perseverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother, Alex. My brother Alex is going to get into an argument with everybody over his beliefs. My brother is loyal to the idea of “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are real and doesn’t care about what anybody else has to say. I tried to convince him millions of times there is no physical proof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “Ancient artifacts are proof of aliens.” Honestly, my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about you that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “It’s not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insecurity.” My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back. One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone he’s not. He said, “I tried being someone I’m not and it’s not me. I’m a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still like learning new things.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes, even if it's aliens, his family, or himself.
448	18335	7	3	This is my story about being patient, I chose to write a story about a time you was patient. My example of that is me at a doctor's office and waiting for two hours to get a brace for my friend's wrist. First the setting is in the waiting room and then an office, where we had to wait for two hours. So me and my dad were in this waiting room; it was supposed to be a short appointment and the nurse told us to sit down, and there were many other people waiting as well. So I sat down thinking my mom is going to be here soon. Time seemed to pass slowly at first and it was a test of my patience because I had to be very patient. But my dad, he was worried and then he fell asleep. As people went by and names were called to get help, I remained patient. Many minutes went by, and an hour passed, then another. I said to myself, this is for my friend, but that thought helped me stay calm. Suddenly, I heard my name called. I jumped up from my seat and woke my dad up and we went to the room. The nurse walked in and gave me the brace, got everything settled, and then we left. That was a story about me being patient at the doctor's office for a thirty-minute thing that took much longer.
449	18336	7	3	Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time, but when you're impatient, you want to overcome the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was extremely impatient. My brother Mark and I were waiting for a new video game to come out but it comes out in ten days. So he waited a day, checked the date, and saw it was still nine days away. Then waited another day and checked again. He wasted eight days just waiting and checking while I focused on my schoolwork. His grade dropped to a C+ and now he’s blaming the game company! So I told him hard work leads to success. He tried harder in his classes; he was using his time on his grades while his game he wants is still coming, he’s a lot happier now that he's patient, using time wisely while keeping himself occupied with other things.
450	18337	7	3	This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song ended I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say Usher tickets were on sale that morning, I froze to listen; the tickets were going on sale down town. I told my mom and she rushed to the car and we got down there so fast you wouldn’t even see us leave. When I got to the line it was so long it seemed like it went on forever. I waited and waited; it felt like it only moved an inch. I waited and still waited; I began to get mad but I stood in line patiently. When my long wait was over I began to jump for joy. As I walked to the counter the lady said, “Sorry, we are all sold out.” I couldn’t believe it; I began to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing; it was so unfair. And that’s the time I was patient for nothing, a lesson in disappointment.
451	18338	7	3	Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so much. About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I definitely had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and ordered my new boots. When they arrived, they were too small so, we sent them back. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didn’t come. I had to be patient. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship something, it goes through fourteen day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom had gotten a new credit card that week. Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But @CAPS1 the problem is fixed and I’m glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 riding comfortably in my new riding boots. It was a long wait, but it was worth it in the end.
452	18339	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was waiting for my mom to pick me up from school at @TIME1. School end’s at @NUM1 so I had to wait outside for an hour and a half almost. It was winter at the time so it was about @NUM2 f degrees. It was very windy too so I used my instrument case to block the wind and snow from my face. But that did not help much because I could not feel my face and I saw a clock inside the school and I found I had only been here @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow was terrible I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot chocolate then @DATE1 then it was florida in @DATE1 on a hot day. But I was staying patient as I could but it was very hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my moms car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient. I was just relieved the long, cold wait was finally over.
453	18340	7	3	Having a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know some one who does? well that’s exactly what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always wondered about her there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldn’t wait but you know what she had patience. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasn’t like other children, couldn’t wait and always bother her parents she just sat patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2’s too. She couldn’t wait to leave but you know what got her, patience in the store and get that specific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted it was just lip gloss, five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home she was so tired and she went up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait, that’s how accidents and problems happen and this little girl got every thing she wanted one thing, she had patience. Her patience was the real key to her happiness.
454	18341	7	3	I was at the detroit airport. It was around @NUM1 am, the sky was bright and gloomy but no rain, just a warm breeze blowing in my face. My mom, brother and @CAPS1 through the tall metal doors and saw everything from gift shops to our destiny where we would @NUM2. We got our tickets and headed off into the plane. We went through metal detectors that caught nothing but my leather striped pink and brown belt. I slipped it back on and started walking. When we entered the plane we passed a lot of people I didn’t know. I got the window seat, and there my mom, brother, and I sat in crammed blue chairs waiting in excitement and fear to fly off into the sunshine state. The anticipation built as we waited for the plane to finally take off.
455	18342	7	3	Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patient because my little cousin who live in @LOCATION1 had a disorder since birth. It takes her a little longer to get things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little world but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with training wheels but she tried and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So I’m taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. She’s improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really don’t yell at her cause shes very emotional and sensitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience. So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patient and she will @CAPS1. With enough patience and kindness, she can continue to make wonderful progress.
456	18343	7	3	Yesterday I went to the orthodontist and waited for my check-up. The wait took a little while but finally it was my turn next. When I got home I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready, but even though it was only an hour until the meal would be ready, the time seemed like it was a lifetime. The delicious aroma coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat patiently and read my book until the cooking was done. Afterwards I was watching Ghost Hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with their toys. So I had to pause the show because they can't do anything when the television is on. So patiently, I waited for an excruciating fifteen minutes until they were done. So overall I think I was very patient yesterday.
457	18344	7	3	This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was two days before I had to go to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots; I never liked shots because they hurt and make you feel sleepy. I usually never have patience but this time I did. I had one more day and then I would be at the doctor. I was beginning to understand why people should have patience and that it’s easy to do. Today was my doctor's appointment and I was scared. When I walked into the clinic I always feel sick and tired. My mom went to sign my name in and I felt even sicker because I worried about how many shots I would have to get. My doctor called me and I was terrified; my mom always told me that it doesn’t hurt if you don’t look at it. So I went back to the doctor's office and my doctor told me to get on the scale. I was really relieved when he gave me a hearing test and an eye test. I asked if I had to get any shots and he said not yet but I might have to. When I finished with my hearing test, I was done and I had been scared for nothing. When I got home I had learned two lessons: one was not to worry about anything and I learned how to have patience. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor.
458	18345	7	3	This past summer, my mom, and my older sister, all went to a popular band’s concert. My mom wasn't very excited, my sister was only excited just to see the opening act, but I was very excited just to be going. When we entered the parking lot to the large music venue there was a huge line at the door; it took up half the parking lot! But we had to wait in that line for an hour before we got in. When we got inside and to our seats, it started to rain and, of course, it was an outdoor concert. So by the time the opening act got done I was soaked. Then people started setting up the stage for the main band. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish setting up. My sister and my mom were both getting irritated but I kept waiting and staying positive. On the bright side it was an amazing concert and I'm glad I got to have the experience, but next time I'm wearing a hat!
459	18346	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when my brother, my sister, and I were told we were going to Disneyland; which is a big deal to us. My siblings and I were fighting in the kitchen about something stupid, of course, when all of a sudden our parents called us out. ""This is great,"" I thought. As I was thinking about what punishment we were going to get, my mom broke my thought and told us we were going on vacation. ""What punishment?"" I asked. ""What?"" my mom replied. ""Never mind,"" I told her. We were going on vacation to Disneyland and to the beach. But we had to wait one whole week. Every day my little brother would ask ""When are we going on our trip?"" and every day my mom would say the same thing. ""In one week, in four days, in three days, in two days."" Finally it was the day to go on our vacation and my parents were proud of me for being very patient for a week waiting to go to Disneyland. That was a time when I was very patient."
460	18347	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my dad’s office. We were there for an hour, and I had to be patient until we left. It was not easy being patient in that quiet, grown-up environment. I had to take an entire hour not saying anything and just sitting still in the chair. I occupied myself by looking at the pictures on the wall and the books on the shelf. Finally, my dad finished his work and told me it was time to go, and I was so relieved the long, quiet wait was over.
461	18348	7	3	My dad can be very patient sometimes. When he’s not angry, he takes the time to explain things carefully, especially when I'm struggling with my homework. He will sit with me for as long as it takes, never rushing or showing any sign of frustration, and his calm demeanor makes even the most difficult problems seem manageable. This patience of his is a quiet strength that I truly admire and hope to emulate in my own life.
462	18349	7	3	A time when I was patient was actually a few days ago. I was standing in line at the store with my mother so we could return a box that didn’t work. This was the third time we have had to return these boxes. I had to stand in line for a half of an hour and watch nothing but angry customers. Still it wasn’t our turn in line. This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all; in fact, when he left he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally it was our turn and my mom was very patient with the worker, (even though she didn’t want to be) the worker didn’t know what was wrong with box so she gave her a new one and we left. Being patient can bring good things just like this quote I have always liked which says “good things come to those who wait.” It is very true so remember! Be patient, because in the end, it often leads to a much more positive outcome for everyone involved.
463	18350	7	3	The Thompson volleyball players, also known as the Tigers, lost our tournament. We went on Saturday at a local restaurant. And you know Sarah. She had asked for some chopsticks and the server made us wait for ten minutes for chopsticks. So then a volleyball player asked and she gave everybody some but the adults! We had so much fun. I had asked for some napkins but we did not get none. I was really mad at the waiter but I had fun and the other girls had fun! Despite the service hiccups, our team's spirit remained high, and we enjoyed our time together after the game.
464	18352	7	3	One important skill you need in the life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child doing soccer, basketball, cross country, and football. But, with my broken arm I had to be patient with my sports. Being patient paid off and my arm healed faster without becoming worse or even more injured. Then I played sports after I had my cast cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough, you will often find that the outcome is worth the difficult wait.
465	18353	7	3	I was waiting for my grandpa to get home. He was gone to an Amish sale to find me a chicken coop for my chickens. I was helping my grandma can in the morning. I was so excited for him to get home. Then I went outside. I was doing work to pass the time. I first cleaned the barn. Then I did the cattle chores. I fed them, walked them, then watered them, then I cleaned the chicken coop. Then I did chicken chores. I collected the eggs. I fed them and I watered them. Then I had some fun; I worked on volleyball. Then I practiced hitting and pitching for softball. Then I worked on shooting hoops. Then I rode the gator for a little while. Then I went in for lunch. When I came back out I thought, what can I do? Then I saw the thrashing hill. I know I would thrash some wheat. So I got out the slasher and went to the field to start thrashing. I loaded the truck too. Then when I got back to put the other tractor out and attached the header to do more, I went out and worked the ground. When I got back I was thinking, what am I going to do now, when I heard a truck pulling in; it was my grandpa. We got in the truck to go to town, and I was finally able to see the new chicken coop he had brought back for me.
466	18354	7	3	One time when I was patient I was playing a football game with my friends and the other team was creaning us. The score was lopsided, and my teammates were getting visibly frustrated, making more mistakes as the game went on. But even though we were losing I still managed to stay calm, encouraging everyone to focus on one play at a time. We began to work together more effectively, slowly closing the point gap. Our steady effort and composure eventually turned the game around, and we ended up beating them, @NUM1, which was an incredible feeling and a clear lesson in the power of patience.
467	18355	7	3	Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life such as getting a job. One way you would have to be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is reviewing your resume, taking his sweet time to make a decision. You might feel anxious waiting for a response, but you don’t want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry up because that would make you not get the job. Displaying calmness and understanding during the hiring process leaves a positive and professional impression. So in conclusion patience is a good like skill to have because it can help our progress in life by allowing us to navigate stressful situations successfully.
468	18356	7	3	Just be patient lucie said to @CAPS1. I will be done soon. How soon is soon? Awile. I will be done fileing papers in about an hour then I will take you to the park an hour? that is such a long time. Just go watch tv. but I dont want to leave me alone or when I get done I wont take you to the park ok. So @CAPS1 whent and placed vidow games with his little sister @PERSON1 for awhile, and made some pizza, which helped the time pass more quickly. Soon after, his friend from school come over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and his and his mom. So he asked lucie if he could go to the park with ryan and she said yes just be back by five oíclock. and he and @PERSON1 had a great time, playing on the swings and slides. and ryans mom got them all ice cream, a cool, sweet treat. and he learned that being patient is very very important, as things often work out for the best if you just wait calmly.
469	18357	7	3	Iíve been to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 before, my family and I went about a year ago. Their were so many rides! we were astounded of how many people were their, creating a bustling, energetic atmosphere. My family and I decided to go on the little rides first to build up our courage. We went on things like the ì @CAPS2 trapî, ì@CAPS3 starî, which were fun and spinning. Also many water rides that splashed and cooled us off. At the end of the day, my family and I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the ì@CAPS4 timbers.î The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to, with its loud creaks and towering drops. Their was line of prolly @NUM1 people, winding back and forth. I told my mom I didn’t want to wait long, fidgeting impatiently. She said ìyou need patienceî I said ok fine ! We finally reached the front and it was the ride, it was pretty fun, a thrilling rush from start to finish. After we got off I said ìmom that patience really paid off because that was the best ride all day.î
470	18358	7	3	When I got my bow I was very very very excited, finally holding the thing I had wanted for so long. Well I was excited because my older sister @PERSON1 got a bow befor me and I thought that it was unfair, and I asked my parents about it constantly. I had to wait @NUM1 whole year till I got my bow at @CAPS1 time, which felt like an eternity. Well my mom and dad hide it in my bedroom in my closet I never noticed it befor, a clever surprise for my birthday. That is the time when I had to be patince when I had to wait to get my bow, learning that good things often come to those who wait. Now almost ever day Iím outside shoting it, improving my aim and enjoying my favorite gift. Thanks for listening and reading about my lesson in patience.
471	18361	7	3	Let me get one thing straight… I’m not patient. I mean, I can be at times, but mostly I’m not. If there is something coming up like my birthday, I will not stop talking or thinking about it. By not being patient I just mean I can’t wait. Most of the time, however, when we are going to a boring family house, I can wait because I know there is no exciting alternative. It is in those moments of pure anticipation that my impatience truly shows itself, but in the dull routine, I find a quiet, if reluctant, acceptance.
472	18362	7	3	My sister and I had just woken up one bright Saturday morning. Mom was at our door. The light shinned through our curtains and our covers. Mom pushed the door open just a crack and said, “Time to get up.” “No,” I got up moaning, “Let me sleep. I’m sleeping.” Mom helped me up and hugged me while I was stretching, and then I went into the living room. My parents were in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but it was aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the tv when I didn’t know my mom was on the couch. “Hey, go put the clothes in the dryer,” she called. “O.K.,” I replied, “I want to come downstairs too.” “Fine,” he exclaimed. “Weird,” I thought in my head. We walked down the stairs in the hall to the laundry room; when we finished putting the clothed in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said “Do you smell that?” Mom looked frightened and said “Oh no, I’m cooking something.” My eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened it and my sister pushed me outside. “Fresh air!” we moaned. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire; we ran towards Mom still on the couch sleeping. We shook her and shook her but she didn’t wake up, so I said “cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” “What’s wrong with ya’ll!” Mom yelled. “The stove is on fire, look at it!” I screamed. She stood, we ran, she grabbed a cup of water and poured it on the stove. “I need to teach you how to cook better or until you won’t set anything on fire!” I said, my heart finally slowing its frantic pace as the crisis passed.
473	18363	7	3	There are thousands of different languages in the world and different dialects of these languages, in all that is more than six thousand different languages. But in each language patient means the same thing, understanding and tolerant. Everyone had to be patient at one point or another; let me tell you about one time where I was patient. It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized that we were both at fault. I sent her e-mails, text messages, and I called her cell phone and home phone at least ten times. She didn’t answer or reply. I got even more frustrated the more she ignored me, then I talked to my cousin about it. “You have to be patient with her, this is your first fight,” she told me in a calm voice. So, I waited by the phone to see if she messaged me back without using swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day she talked to me. She said “I’m sorry too, thanks for being patient with me. I’ve missed hanging out with you, how about we sit together at band?” “I’d like that,” I replied, and we finally made up after five days of fighting. After that experience I learned that being patient can pay off. So wait your turn to speak, and understand why people say what they say and mean what they mean. Patience is always the key to resolving conflicts and mending friendships.
474	18364	7	3	The time I was patient is when I was told to clean up my house and my mom said she would like me to be finished when she gets back. So I straightened up, vacuuming, spreading my bed, cleaning the bathroom, taking the dogs outside, cleaning their raven, did the dishes, took out the trash, and did the laundry. Once I was done with a lot, I would watch my brother play the game or get on the computer. I waited about the whole day, and once she got home she didn’t bring what she said she would. She said she forgot, so we were going to get pizza instead. It was a test of my patience, but I managed to stay calm and not complain, understanding that sometimes plans change.
475	18365	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the doctor's office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out, but he was taking a really long time to come out and I was trying so hard to be patient, struggling to stay calm and not get anxious. I watched the clock and read old magazines, taking deep breaths to steady my nerves. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the doctor came out and called my name. I started to feel better immediately, relieved that the long wait was finally over and I could now address the reason for my visit.
476	18366	7	3	One day me and my friend @PERSON1 were at @ORGANIZATION2 and we were in the line for the @ORGANIZATION1. We ran up to the line, and we had to wait about a half hour till we got on, watching the ride carry other people up and down with loud cheers. But the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient, talking and making the time pass quickly. After the ride we got in line for the @CAPS1! WOW! What a line, I think we were in that line for at least a hour and a half before we got on, slowly inching forward under the hot sun. But you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient, and our patience was finally rewarded with an exciting ride on The @CAPS2!.
477	18367	7	3	One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. His keys were some were in my room so I looked every were, under piles of clothes and between the books on my shelf. After twenty minutes went by I still could not find them but my dad was still patient, waiting calmly downstairs. I deystroyed my room looking for his keys, they were not in my dresser, closset, bed, or on my floor. I just had them to unlock the car and now the keys are gone then when I went to tell my dad who was being so patient for a hour I fond them in my pocket, a simple oversight that ended the long search.
478	18368	7	3	Once apani time there were to kids one was name @CAPS1 he wasnít patience at all. The other kid was name @PERSON1 he be was patience. They went for a walk in the woods and get lost @CAPS1 would not stop complaining about being tired and hungry. @PERSON1 told him stop complaining @CAPS3 @CAPS1 didnít until he say a hunted house @CAPS1 told @PERSON2 want to go inside with him. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 didnít want to go in so @CAPS1 went in and act like he got hurt so @PERSON1 ran in there the dorslamd shut and the door nob feel off. They were scared it was dark and they could hear strange creaking sounds. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said lets get at of here! @PERSON1 said how the door nob fell off. @CAPS1 said I donít know they ran though the house there wore no other door or windows the were terrify then a ghost was coming at them and he said happy @CAPS7 it was there dad he built the house for them and said all you had to do is push the door open. and they all went home, learning a valuable lesson about patience and fear.
479	18369	7	3	Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage by keeping myself distracted. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didnít care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldnít believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend's house. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but Iím still alive, right? My friends donít know me to have patience and I donít either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again, at least not without a lot of effort. Ever.
480	18370	7	3	When I was pashit I was doing my math @CAPS1. I cold it figer out The @DATE1 my ant did it @CAPS2 me at all I @CAPS3 quit at That poit but this time I was pashit and @CAPS4, taking a deep breath and looking at the problem from a new angle. I @CAPS5 it, finally solving the equation and feeling a great sense of accomplishment.
481	18371	7	3	This is a story about a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient is when I was at the food store waiting for my food. I ordered my food and they took all day to give it to me. I waited so patiently. Other people were getting their orders and they still did not give me mine, so I went outside and told my granddad that they were about to give me my food. I told him that because he kept asking me why they were taking so long. So I went back in the food store and asked them why are you taking so long, they said it’s coming in a second. Then I sat down in the food store and I looked and saw my friends coming into the food store. So we started talking and waiting patiently for our food. Their names are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @PERSON1. My name is @CAPS3, I was born in @DATE1, I was raised in the city of @LOCATION1. I was patient because I did not get angry and I waited. So then they called my name and said my food was ready. Then I got my food and told my friends I’m about to go home, after that I left. That is the complete story about a time when I was patient.
482	18373	7	3	One day I was looking at a catalog in a sporting goods store, and saw a goalkeeper shirt that I really wanted. So I went to my mom and showed her what I wanted. She said it was a bit pricey, but that she would get it for me. The next week was very long, waiting for the shirt to arrive. On @DATE1 it finally came, and it was pale yellow with red, blue, and purple details. I finally had a brand new goalkeeper jersey to wear to my games and make great saves, which made the long wait completely worthwhile.
483	18374	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my dad to come home from work so I could open my package that I got before he left on a three-day trip out of state. The package sat on the table, and I looked at it every day, resisting the urge to open it without him. I knew he wanted to be there to see my reaction. The days felt very long, but I waited calmly. When he finally came back, I got to open it with him, and that shared moment was the best part of the gift.
484	18375	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was my @NUM1 birthday. Why? Because I was waiting for my phone and my mom kept telling me that I was going to get it on the first of @DATE1. But I still didn’t believe her, as the day went on and I opened my other presents. I tried to stay hopeful and calm. Then, guess what? My last present was my brand new cell phone and a case. Now that is what I call patience, and it was rewarded in the end.
485	18376	7	3	“Are they here yet?” I said as I paced back and forth. “Patience, it takes a while to get from the locker room all the way down here,” said @CAPS1. “@CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera!” “@CAPS3 got him!” said @PERSON1. “@CAPS4’s right behind us.” “@CAPS5 funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swear I’ll @CAPS6 off the camera!” yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 attempted to grab his clothes… and missed. “@CAPS8! My patience has run out @CAPS7!” I said taking another picture. “@CAPS10 I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet,” I continued. “@CAPS11! You can @CAPS5 put this on the internet!” “So you’re going to stop picking on us?” I asked. “@CAPS8!” @CAPS4 said, “@CAPS13, then I’ll just zoom in right here.” “@CAPS13!” @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. So to show the little respect @CAPS3 had for him, @CAPS3 gave him his clothes, turned around, and walked away, bringing the whole ordeal to a close.
486	18377	7	3	Crack! I twisted through the air and landed face up with my arm wrapped around me. I felt a throbbing pain immediately. I wobbled to my feet, “what just happened?” I thought to myself. I once again began to feel the tremendous pain shooting through my forearm. I bit my lip as hard as I could to choke back all of the tears from just pouring out like a waterfall. My friends launched toward me, asking if I was okay. Soon, I started holding my arm protectively. “I think I might have broken it,” I replied in between sobs. They rushed to get an aid, as quickly as possible. I soon found myself in the sick room after making a call to my parents to alert them of what had just happened. I sat there for hours waiting for my parents to come pick me up to go get an x-ray at Children's Hospital. They were both at work and were not able to come and get me right away. The day groaned on and I became more and more anxious. Finally the bell rang; it was three o'clock at last. Bang! The door swung open; it was my dad and not far behind him was my mom. Three o'clock is when they get out of work. After my mom and dad told me how much they were glad it was nothing more than a broken arm, they immediately rushed me to the hospital. That was my experience of a time I had to be patient. And in the end it turned out I had a broken arm. In life there are going to be many situations where you're going to have to be patient, but all you can do is take life as it comes at you.
487	18378	7	3	Jenny and her brother were twins, brother and sister. Every year a carnival was built up next to their house with games, rides and delicious food. One day Jenny and her brother went to ask their mother politely for some money to go on the ferris wheel. “Mom, can we each have a dollar to go on the ferris wheel?” they asked. “Sure,” mom said and handed them two crisp dollars. Jenny and her brother were so excited they ran straight to the line for the ferris wheel. They waited and waited for an hour and it was finally their turn. During this time the man that was in charge of the ferris wheel had watched Jenny and her brother wait patiently in line. As they were about to step into the cart, two mean boys pushed them off to the ground and took their seat. Now mom had taught them how to be nice to everyone and they remembered that, so they got back up and let them go without a fuss. When it was their turn again, the man in charge of the ferris wheel took notice of what just happened and told them that he was proud of them and that they would go around the ferris wheel thrice more for their patience. After the wonderful ride, they thanked the man sincerely and ran happily home to tell their mom what happened. Their mama was so proud of them and hugged Jenny and her brother tightly.
488	18379	7	3	I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing, not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready, then your mind makes you think like it is going to come up close, and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. You must remain perfectly still and quiet, controlling your breathing while you wait for the perfect moment. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it, then it really pays off. The reward for your self-control makes the long, quiet wait completely worthwhile.
489	18380	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was in fifth grade. It was after my birthday and I had wanted pink Converse shoes. My dad in Texas said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandma's house and then have my grandma send them to me and that I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes, checking the mail every day. In one week, they were not at my house. I didn't want to bother my dad and call him every day about them so I just patiently waited. After one more week I began to worry and get mad so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour and my shoes still hadn’t come. At this point I just decided they would just come when they came and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day and I was ecstatic. I thanked my dad and I wore my shoes the next day, knowing my patience had finally paid off.
490	18381	7	3	"Generally I'm patient, and sometime I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient I am, my father's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs heavily, and gets very impatient. He says things like, ""Come on, come on!"" and taps his fingers on the steering wheel. Honestly, it's scary to be with my father in traffic jams, or long lines. But after the long line ends, my father's himself again which is a great relief to me. It is a clear reminder that patience, or the lack of it, can truly test a person's character."
491	18383	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother in the backyard and then he kicked me in the chin. I promised him that I would not tell on him even when I busted my chin open the second time he kicked me. The pain was sharp, but I kept my word. I fell to the ground right in front of everybody else, and I was being swarmed like a bunch of bees around a hive full of honey. Everyone was asking if I was okay, but I just got up and brushed myself off, staying calm. That was when I was being patient.
492	18384	7	3	One time I was told by my big brother that we were going to go to Michigan Adventure, so I was waiting till he would come home. My dad told me that I should get ready to go, so I packed up my shorts and a t-shirt, and I did that. Then I just sat there for about an hour, waiting. I called him and he said he was on his way. I waited a little longer, feeling excited but trying to stay calm. Finally, he arrived and we were able to leave for our trip.
493	18386	7	3	"It was the bottom of the ninth inning, the bases were loaded with a full count, and there were two outs. As the pitcher hurled a fastball right down the center, the batter swung and hit his very first grand slam. The crowd exploded, and as we were about to leave, the announcer said, ""Don't forget, kids, today and today only, down on the field the players are signing autographs."" I begged and pleaded my dad to let us stay, and he finally agreed. By the time I got down there, there was a huge line. As time slowly ticked by, minutes seemed like hours. I could see kids getting antsy. I would have to be patient because my dad had said, ""The only way we can stay is if you are patient."" The wait took forever; all you had to do was look around and you would see kids going nuts. The little ones were crying. I could tell I was maybe one of the last five people. Being patient, even my dad was getting frustrated. The line took at least two and a half hours to get to the front, but it felt like several days. I finally got the whole team's autograph and I was so happy. I even surprised myself that day; I had no idea that I had it in me to be that patient for two and a half hours. On our way home, my dad stopped at Wendy's and got me a Frosty, and he said it was for being so patient. I decided that being patient was not so bad, and from now on I will be more patient in the future."

The TV was on, the radio was on, and a bunch of people were talking all at once. When we got there, my mother signed all three of us in on the sign-in sheet, and then we had to sit and wait. We waited for a long time on the stiff chairs. I really wanted to leave and come back another day, but my mom said we had to wait. I got hungry and I was sleepy from the long wait. We waited for an hour, and I didn’t let it bother me, so I turned on my music player and listened to it until it was time for us to be called next. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even more hungry, but I didn’t say anything. So we waited and waited, and finally, we were up next. We all got our hair done, and it looked nice. Then when we left, we went to get some food because we were all hungry from the long afternoon. And that was a time I was patient at the hair salon.
495	18388	7	3	"Once upon a time there was a kid named Jack. Jack had a little brother named Timmy, and Timmy was five and Jack was twelve. Since Jack was a lot older than Timmy and he was his brother, he had to watch him a lot. Jack had a lot of patience since he had to watch him every night because his parents worked late. But he still thought his brother was annoying. His parents knew that if they paid him, he would keep watching him, so he did. But one day when Jack’s little brother Timmy would not stop complaining because he did not get his way, Jack finally got mad and said, ""If you don’t stop whining, then I will not watch you anymore and you will have to go to daycare."" Timmy hated daycare, so he stopped right away. Jack was very mad at his brother because he was never like this to him. So he wanted to say he was sorry, and he did, and his brother forgave him. ""I'm sorry that I was making you mad,"" Timmy said. ""It's ok,"" his brother said. ""Just try not to let it happen again,"" Jack said. Then the next day when Jack and his little brother were hanging out after school, everything went well. ""I’m happy that we are not mad at each other because I don’t want to go to daycare,"" Timmy said to his brother. ""Yeah, and I don’t want you to go because then I will have nothing to do,"" Jack said. The two brothers were happy again."
496	18389	7	3	There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 with my family. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for what felt like @NUM1! It was a nightmare more coming true. We got hungry sitting in the car. We really didn't have any snacks or food with us. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 hours before we got into the park. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on first. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line anyway. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were complaining a lot about the long wait. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2, trying to keep our spirits up. Actually it didn't take as long as I thought it would, which was a nice surprise. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time as it went up and down the hills. The coaster was over too quickly. I was sad that the ride ended so fast. But it was worth the three hour wait for the thrill. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother were acting like they were dying from the wait, making a big scene. But the wait only felt like an hour long once we were moving through the queue. I was scared of that coaster as it looked very intense. But I loved it once the ride began. It was a lot of fun to ride roller coasters with my family. We left after a while, completely exhausted. It was a long day but a memorable one. The end.
497	18390	7	3	In this story I am writing about the time when the video game @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was coming out for the @CAPS3 console on @NUM1. The game will be the last game for the company Bungie, which made it a big event. I've already have it and it is coming soon. It looks pretty good from the trailers, but I don't understand why your main character stays on a planet called @CAPS2 and is the only human there, and then the entire game character gets bum-rushed by roughly @NUM2 aliens with swords and they chop up your character into blue size pieces with their little toy plastic swords. And the first time I went to buy the game at @CAPS5 @CAPS6 at @NUM3 PM, their parking lot was filled with probably all @NUM4 year olds who live in their mom's basement, all there for the same reason. So we waited in the long line and got it about @NUM5 week after its initial release date. We bought it then we got home and opened it and it wasn't the right game it was some weak @PERSON1 game so we completed it in like two minutes so that is my story on being patient for a game that was ultimately a letdown.
498	18391	7	3	When I was in fifth grade I wasn't doing so well in math so my @CAPS1 tutor agreed on helping me study for my upcoming test. So on @DATE1 I got up really early but my mom was running really late getting home from work, and she was the one driving me there for my session. So my @CAPS1 was being really understanding and patient about the situation, which I appreciated. So my mom got home, drove me, and we ended up an hour and a half late but my @CAPS1 was still very patient and welcoming when we arrived. So we started to review the material and I was completely lost; I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she still tried and was very understanding of my struggle. I got almost every question wrong that she asked me and she still tried to her best ability to help me understand it, explaining things in different ways. She had to helping me for about @NUM1 hours straight but she followed through and really helped me grasp the concepts, and I actually got an A on that quiz all because of her help and patience with me. I know it must have been hard to work with me for that long without losing her patience with me and I really respect that dedication and I am very grateful to know someone like that who was so supportive.
499	18392	7	3	"A time I was patient was on @DATE1, during my @NUM1 grade year. I was sitting doing my meap test when my stomach started to hurt badly. For about @NUM3 minutes I sat there moving around in my seat, trying to focus. Then I raised my hand to ask the teacher to call my mom. When she called on me I asked her and @CAPS3 said "" @CAPS1.S @PERSON1 can you take ??? to the office."" And @PERSON1 said ok. Then me and @PERSON1 went to the office and I called my house phone; my sister picked up the phone I said to her "" @CAPS2 let me speak to mama."" @CAPS3 said ""hold up."" Then my mom said ""hello."" I said mama can you please come pick me up my stomach hurts real bad."" @CAPS3 said ""ok"" and hung up. I waited about another @NUM3 minutes sitting there with patience, tossing and turning from my stomach hurting so bad. Then finally I called again ""I said moma are you coming?"" @CAPS3 said "" @CAPS4 I'm on my way."" I said ""ok"" and hung up. I was sitting there patient and in pain till finally my mom walked through the school doors and signed me out. The @CAPS3 said ""come on"" and my sister and ??? were sitting out in the truck waiting to go to the family health center. I sat in the front seat, relieved. I was asleep the whole way home then I woken up when we got there; I went in the house, layed on the couch, and fell asleep, glad the wait was over."
500	18393	7	3	My mum is someone who is incredibly patient. One time when I was little, I got a big wad of gum stuck in my hair. I was crying a lot and moving around nervously as my mom patiently tried to get the sticky gum out of my hair. She kept on telling me gently to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself, which would have been understandable. When she couldn't get it out with peanut butter and said that she would have to cut it out, I had screamed because I was scared. Yet, with immense patience, she was somehow able to carefully cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice even though I wouldn't sit still for more than a few seconds. I think my mom is the most patient person that I know, because whenever something stressful or frustrating happens, she is always patient and calm about it, setting a wonderful example for me.
501	18394	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the dentist's office to get a cavity filled. When we got there they said my appointment wasn't for another hour, but my mom didn't want to leave and come back. I was so bored, but the TV was on in the waiting room, which helped a little. When it finally was my turn, it took the dentist, who is also my neighbor, about another half hour to get all his tools ready and set up. This whole experience was a learning experience for me, as I learned to be patient when someone takes a long time to do what seems like nothing, understanding that sometimes delays are just part of the process.
502	18395	7	3	"Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm clock was going off and it was 7:30 and I already missed the bus! Rushing to get out of bed, I quickly got dressed. Hoping my brother and sister were downstairs all ready waiting for me, I ran down. Oh no! They weren't downstairs! Running back up stairs like the house is on fire, I went in my brother's room and yelled, ""Jake! Jake! We already missed the bus."" I didn't wait for a reply and ran right to my sister's room. Yelling the same thing, she quickly got out of bed and got dressed. Walking downstairs, thinking everything is going to be fine, I got breakfast ready. Then my sister came running down. Grabbing her food, she yelled, ""Hurry!"" I glanced at the time. It was 7:45 am, only fifteen more minutes, so I started eating my breakfast. But my brother didn't come down yet. Finishing my breakfast, I went back up stairs and woke my dad and my brother up. They came downstairs behind me. My brother just took his time eating breakfast, and I knew now that we were going to be late. Looking back at the clock it was 7:55, only five minutes! ""We aren't going to make it,"" I said. Finally every one hopped in the van and dad drove us to school. My sister and I were yelling, ""Go! Floor it!"" Dad ignored us, and my brother didn't really care if we were late or not. Then finally we made it, only ten minutes late. I guess my brother is the only patient one in the house, as his calmness stood in stark contrast to our frantic panic."
503	18396	7	3	"There was a kid named Leo who was always very patient. He always waited for everyone else and he never complained. That morning Leo just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bathrooms were taken up, but Leo didn't complain; he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. Consequently, Leo was a little bit late to school. The math teacher Mrs. Gable said, ""Come here,"" and the class said, ""Ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! Leo is in trouble."" Mrs. Gable said come here and Leo put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton of bricks. During lunch Leo was at the end of the line. Once Leo had gotten up there, there was no more food; it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch from the back. Once Leo got home his family threw a patient party for him to celebrate his virtue. Leo was honored and also happy to be recognized. That night was the best for Leo, filled with joy and a sense of accomplishment for his quiet strength."
504	18398	7	3	"As my dad always tells me, patience is one of the very basics to being successful in life. As I mature I find out more and more that patience is important. I remember a time when I had to display patience for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to Cedar Point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, Millennium Force. ""That ride gave me the most fun, heart-stopping, adrenaline-pumping rush ever,"" I thought. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, and I began to get tired. After two hours of walking we finally reached the Millennium Force. I was disappointed to find out it’s a two-and-a-half hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figured the best way to handle the wait was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain the longer it takes. And before we knew it we were about to get on the ride, proving that patience truly pays off in the end."
505	18399	7	3	"""One hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!"" I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the “Maverick” at Cedar Point. ""That’s what the sign says, but it could take longer,"" my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone, ""I guess we can wait,"" but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zilch, none, no patience! Why did I say yeah? Right when my thoughts were done the line moved up a little. That was quick, I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the corkscrew and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didn’t work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the Maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didn’t want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every second. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought of nothing and just tapped my fingers and moved up. We were finally at the front, and I didn’t complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end I thought it was really worth it. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain, having successfully endured the long wait. That was a time I was patient."
506	18401	7	3	One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive threw @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went. I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ake so my ear was hearting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours, which felt very long. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventully I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would, trying to keep the peace. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said ìare mom and dadî. He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reasonís why I had to be patient on are @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town.
507	18402	7	3	A lot of people are patient and they wait because they donít want to make someone mad or mess-up something that they are doing. People always be careful of what they are doing, thinking about others. I ever be patient sometimes and its not that hard to be patient it is pretty easy. Everyone absouletly knows that, those people are out their, they know, trust me. Theirs many different things thatíve been patient for, but I donít know which one I choose to write, cause there is alot of them. ì@CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, wait patiently but @CAPS1 you canít or canít hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use other one, or @CAPS1 someone on the computer then wait for your turn, but @CAPS1 its been pass in an hour then tell that person to get off not to be mean, but you either need on and have your turn. There is no way you canít be patient for at leat @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes. Not too hard. Itís pretty easy and everyone knows that too you know, so just try it sometime.
508	18403	7	3	I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to fuzzys and it took a long time. It took @NUM1 minutes. It seemed like took forever, just sitting there waiting. It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I didít eat nothing and I was so hungry. There was me my mom and dad, all of us waiting together. You can also buy ice cream, which I was looking forward to. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry, which made it harder to wait. I had tries to be calm. Some people have patient and other donít. I kind of have patients. But this time I had no patients, though I managed to wait. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patients and I got through it.
509	18404	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay, so we had to wait. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient, not saying a word. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool, thinking about other things. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch, which was a relief. That the time when I was patient over something and it worked out fine in the end.
510	18405	7	3	My mom was patient when she was in line for her drivers licence it took three hours to get her drivers licence. She was angry but she was patient, not showing it. And the lady that would give the drivers licence took a break when she came back my mom waited another three hours an she still was patient I was there too and I was patient but I wanted to yell at the lady for taking a break and making us wait for her for one extra hour, though I stayed quiet. And another time my mom waited in line under the rum it was burning the only thing she did to cool down was drink for about two hours under eithy one degrees an she was still patient, which showed her strong character. She is a good example of how to wait calmly.
511	18406	7	3	The time I was impatient. On the day of @DATE1, I rose out of bed, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and ate break feast. Then me, my mom, and my brother drove to the doctors, which is an hour from our house. I was not happy because I was tired and just thinking about how long @CAPS1 going to be sitting their just waiting for the doctor to say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 but no I got to sit their sit their staring at the blank, white walls. Soo know were here and @CAPS1 just soo happy to sit and waite because my mom did tell me thousands of times “you need to stop being so unpatient,” well I cainte help it. Any way my mom just signed in for me so I guess I’ll just look at magizeens boring boring boring. They don’t even have people magizeeing “come on” I said my mom said “you need to waite @CAPS1 sure they will call your name any secound,” well not any secound because its been about @NUM1 boring min. ooh lookie here time for lunch but no we have to still just sit here and waite. Gosh I’m so hungry. Well finlly the doctor just called my name and it’s time to wait again in the little examination room! In conclusion theirs a time I was unpatient I was un patient waiting at the doctors just sitting their thats why if it has something to do with waiting “I’m not interested.”
512	18407	7	3	Once upon a time there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was abnovius and always had to time it his way, never able to wait for anything. @PERSON1 always waited his turn with something and shared everything he had. One day while watching @CAPS1.V. they saw a rocket building kit and asked their dad they wanted it. His dad called the phone and ordered it, but said it world take @CAPS2 weeks to arrive. When @ORGANIZATION1 heard it was @CAPS2 weeks he threw a fit. On the other hand @PERSON1 said “@CAPS3 dad” and went to his room calmly. Days would pass and @ORGANIZATION1 would always @CAPS4 dad around because he couldn’t wait. @PERSON1 just took it like it was any other day. @ORGANIZATION1 would sit by the window and watch the street for the delivery truck with his face locked to the glass. Eventually the day came. @ORGANIZATION1 ran out and picked his rocket up first. In that time @PERSON1 walked out the door. When to the of them had the rockets in hand they opened them up. @ORGANIZATION1 was disapointed because he wanted to play now but first he had to build it. @PERSON1 took his time doing step by step instructions and in no time his rocket was done. @ORGANIZATION1 just cramed pieces together and his rocket came out crooked and broke immediately. @ORGANIZATION1 yelled landly. @PERSON1 went to @ORGANIZATION1 and told he would help and in @NUM1 minutes they finished building it correctly. Together they played and had fun for the rest of the afternoon. The end.
513	18408	7	3	Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1, the leaves just beginning to change colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2, so I stopped frequently. My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was posted. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained, dragging their feet along the path. For the next mile or so we continued without finding another map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was so happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us even as we complained and moaned.
514	18409	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a difficult test. I was patient because I went up to the teacher because I needed help and so did the kid in front of me. It took him a while but I just stood there quietly and waited my turn without complaining. It took him around @NUM1 minutes because he needed help with a lot of thing, one question after another. That is the time I was patient, and I felt good about being able to wait calmly.
515	18411	7	3	I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take awhile to explain to and I must use patience in order to help them understand the concepts fully. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and get frustrated easily, like me sometimes. And at times I have been on the phone for a hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends, going over the same point several times. Soon I will once again have to practice patience when I tutor for @CAPS1. To me patience is one of the most important characteristics someone can have, especially when helping others learn.
516	18412	7	3	I am not a very patient person by nature, but I can be when the situation demands it. For example, at my house we only have one bathroom for everyone. I absolutely hate waiting for my turn to go. But I have to wait patiently because I don’t want to juggle pee, so I will wait my turn. I also have to wait for the school bus every morning. I hate waiting; it feels so boring and tedious. But I understand that patience is a good thing to have. If people didn't have patience, there would be a lot more deaths from car accidents, murders, and nervous breakdowns. My sister is a very patient person; she can wait in one spot for hours without complaint. One time, it was Halloween and I was all fidgety from waiting until the bell finally rang so we could go trick-or-treating. She waited calmly and even did her hair while I complained. That experience is a clear reason why patience is so important in life.
517	18413	7	3	"Have you ever been to the doctor's office? Well, on a specific day last month, my brother, my sister, and I had a doctor's appointment, and we even missed school for it. When we got there, the waiting room was completely packed with people. So we found some seats, sat down, and began to wait. We had been waiting for three and a half long hours, so I started to get impatient and also very hungry. I told my mom I was hungry, and everyone else agreed with me. So my mom went to the hospital's food court to get us some pizza and water. When we were done eating our pizza, we waited for another three hours. I started to get really angry because we had been there for a total of many hours. Finally, the nurse came out and said kindly, ""Next,"" so my mom stood up, and then the nurse said, ""Actually, it's for another family."" So I got so impatient I yelled out and said, ""Come on, it's our turn! We been waiting here for a long time and I can't wait any longer!"" My mom finally calmed me down and I said sorry for my rude behavior. When I sat back down and started to wait again, just a second later, it was finally our turn. That experience is exactly why patience is a very important virtue to practice."
518	18414	7	3	Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience is about being understanding and tolerant during delays or difficult situations without becoming upset. For example, imagine a young kid whose mom left for work. She takes several hours to complete her shift and then comes home. When she arrives, the kid looks up and says, “That was quick.” The child's perception of time is different because they were patiently occupied, showing that patience can make a long wait feel shorter. This is what patience truly means—it helps us manage our expectations and reactions to the passage of time.
519	18415	7	3	"For me, I'm not that patient of a person. I lose my patience if someone says something close to me or to any of my friends; I will go off on them. As you can see, I don't tolerate my friends being picked on by someone they don't even know, or that I don't know. There was this one time when me and my friends were walking down the hallway at school. This kid seemed to appear out of nowhere and started to push my friend around. I immediately asked the kid what his problem was, and he said it was none of my business. I told him, ""You're picking on one of my friends, so it is my business."" He stopped picking on my friend and then tried to pick on me instead. But he didn't know that I had my brother and another friend waiting around the corner of the building. So I had the one friend who was right next to me go and get them, which he did. When the kid who was picking on me saw them coming, he quickly ran away. This shows how my impatience with injustice leads me to act quickly to defend my friends."
520	18416	7	3	One time when I was particularly patient was when my mom’s car needed a new battery and I had to get to school. My mom called her friend who lived down the street to come and give our car a boost. We ended up waiting for an hour and a half just waiting on her to arrive. My mom called her back, and she said she couldn't make it because she suddenly needed an oil change herself. After that, we had to walk to the nearest bus stop, which took about thirty minutes. The bus finally picked us up and took us to a major intersection. Then we walked the rest of the way for about a mile to another bus stop where we could catch a second bus. That second bus then took us to the final stop near my school. That entire morning, with all its delays and complications, was a time when I was truly patient.
521	18417	7	3	Patience is about calmly waiting for some thing without unnecessary worry. Like we can say your new shoes will be coming in two weeks; instead of pacing around anxiously all the time, you just walk around like normal, going about your day. For example, in hunting, you sit quietly and wait for a deer to come to you. If you are impatient, you would go look for one and likely scare it away. Sometimes a lot of people can get inpatient about something and become mean or frustrated with others. Being patient is understanding the reasons why it is taking a long time for something to happen. You have to trust that it will come even if it doesn't arrive the exact day it is supposed to. This one time I had an important appointment at one o'clock and my mom and I had to wait in the office until almost five o'clock. And we never got truly mad, just a little bored. This one time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad, who didn't come home until the following morning, testing his patience greatly. In the end, patience is a valuable skill that helps us through many of life's waiting periods.
522	18418	7	3	"Patience is when you are calmly waiting for something, for someone, or for something to happen without getting upset. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but my mom did not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said, ""Wait a little while, be patient."" I went into the examination room and got the shot, and then I got my sucker just as promised. Even though I got the treat, I was still angry with my mom afterward because she knows I hate needles and the surprise made the experience worse. The incident taught me that patience sometimes leads to outcomes we don't like, but getting upset doesn't change what has already happened."
523	18419	7	3	"A beaker bubbled in the chemistry lab. I could smell the strong sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. ""Professor, what’s going on!"" I yelped across the room. ""I found the cure for cancer!"" the scientist said as he had a little jig, a dance that he showed off with great excitement. I am a doctor and I wasn’t so sure, but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. ""Let’s go try it out!"" the scientist screamed. As I zoomed to the car, I waited while he packed up his lab equipment. After fifteen minutes I was pondering where he could be. He’s just having a hard time packing up, I said to myself. So I turned on the radio and eventually fell asleep. After a couple hours I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping for two and a half hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. ""I saved this kitten’s life with my cure for cancer,"" he said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that he saved the kitten, my pager dinged. Mrs. Smith, the lady with extreme brain cancer, needed our help. The scientist got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw Mrs. Smith laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly worked to get her heart rate stabilized. At this moment I wasn’t sure if she would live. ""Should we give it to her?"" the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. ""No, not yet."" I waited five critical minutes for her vitals to improve slightly and then poured it in. Mrs. Smith came back to life. Even though she couldn’t talk, I could tell by her weak smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, ""Thank you."" I only smiled back, knowing that careful timing had saved a life."
524	18421	7	3	I am patient wherever I go, whether it's to the dentist’s office, the orthodontist, or the doctor’s office. The first time is at the dentist’s office when I have to wait to get my teeth cleaned. I usually sit there and read old magazines to pass the time. The next place I am patient is the orthodontist; I sit and wait in the first room and listen to my I-pod. After a few minutes they call me into the second room where I wait a little longer to get my braces tightened. Once I get in the actual office chair I have to wait for the technician to come and tighten them. Finally, there is the doctor’s office where you sit in the big waiting room for a long time and wait for the nurse to call your name. When you get into the examination room, if you are getting shots, you have to wait patiently for the doctor to bring them in. As you can see, a lot of routine things in life take patience, and learning to wait calmly is an important part of growing up.
525	18422	7	3	"One day I had to go to the doctor's office to get shots. When we got into the doctor's office I had to wait in some uncomfortable plastic chairs with my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I didn’t know how it would feel. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience; I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad if the doctor was coming yet, and my dad would always say, ""Have patience."" It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys in the corner, which I had not noticed until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight from the window, I ran to them. But after a few minutes of playing, it got so boring, so I went back and sat down next to my dad. It was getting so boring I couldn’t take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldn’t take it; I started to get so mad, I wanted to just get out of there. But I didn’t let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out and said, ""We're ready for you now,"" and I was relieved that the doctor finally came to give me the shots. But what I didn’t know was that I was going to be in horrible pain for a few days afterward, a consequence I had not patiently considered."
526	18423	7	3	I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of breakaways on odd-man rushes. Most of the breakaways on clear shots didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was two to one and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a breakaway against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it, securing our victory.
527	18424	7	3	“Hurry up,” my friend said. “I know, be patient,” I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences delays without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed. Being patient is all ways a good thing; have you ever heard something like “Patience is a virtue?” Well if you don’t get used to it, you will find life more difficult. Her patience in waiting for me was a small but meaningful act of friendship.
528	18426	7	3	One time when another person I know was patient was when my mother stood in line for over an hour to get the tickets for the show we were going to see. This shows patintence because my mother did not complain while standing in line. She simply waited calmly, knowing that the reward would be worth the wait, and indeed, we enjoyed a wonderful performance together.
529	18427	7	3	One time my best friend and I went to a ride; it was so hot outside but the first ride we went on was called the Thunderbolt. The line was super long, it was like going through a maze because of how the ropes were tied up; we stood in the line for about forty five minutes but it felt like two hours. But I didn’t really complain about it except for my friend; she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her feet were tired, but when we finally got there we started rolling and it was so much fun. I think it was worth waiting for, and it taught me that patience often leads to the best experiences.
530	18428	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I wanted a new bike for my birthday. But I couldn’t get it because my mom had to pay the rent. So I waited and then finally it was my birthday. I didn’t have it but then a few months went by and it was Christmas and I got it and I was so happy. Another time when I was patient was when I had to babysit my cousin for twenty dollars. And I waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he did not. So I waited and he finally gave me my money. But not only did he give me twenty dollars, he gave me a late fee of five dollars and I was happy. And that added up to my money, that my mama gave me and it was thirty dollars and I went skating and to the store with my friends. And I spent some of it at the mall. The final time when I was patient was when it was a few days before my birthday and I was leaving a sleepover. The next day was my party. I did everything I had so much fun it was like heaven at my house, proving that good things come to those who wait.
531	18429	7	3	Patience. Patience is something I have absolutely nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me, but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we don’t want to have to wait through the commercials. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are long lines, people being late, and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes; any longer than that puts me right over the edge. Oh, and by the way, another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a two-hour drive turn into a two-minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish I could have more patience, but I don’t know how to get it. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story, as it’s a struggle I deal with every single day.
532	18430	7	3	"One time I had to be really patient. It was when I was on my way to Florida to see my family. It took four long days to get down there. It would have taken only two or three days, but we stopped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the little stores and roadside restaurants on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them, but to my dad, we absolutely did. On our way, it felt like two whole weeks had passed. My uncle Jake called us every five minutes during the trip. He kept saying things like, ""How close are you?"", ""When are you going to get here?"", ""Are you lost?"", and ""Did you get me some co-co weats?"" I thought that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats so much. I mean, I like them too, but not nearly that much. When we finally got down there, my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dad's car for so long. I walked around for two hours just to get the feeling back into my legs, which were completely numb from the journey."
533	18432	7	3	"The time I was patient was when I went bass fishin' with my stepdad. I could not wait for long, so I decided to talk to myself or sing songs to pass the time. My stepdad said, ""You set your pole down on a sling shot holder and do whatever."" So I went to walk around and explore the world, and I was thinking about how I could possibly learn to do patience. I went to go check on my pole, and I had gotten nothing, so I felt a little discouraged. I cast out far away and then I sat, wait and wait, but until that moment my pole started to jerk around wildly. So I reeled it in and caught a large bass! I was so happy and excited. My stepdad said, ""See, you do got patience after all,"" and I finally understood what he meant."
534	18433	7	3	"The time I needed patience was when we were at the grocery store, Walmart to be exact. When we first got there I was excited because we were going to get lots of junk food, but then we started to get lots of regular food and it looked really good. I started to just want to eat it all right there. The cart was half way full when we got more stuff. It was so completely full that we had to get another cart, and that was when I started to get really hungry. By the time we were in the meat section, I was absolutely starving. My mom said, ""Honey, just get a couple more things."" So I waited, and waited, until she finally told me to go to the checkout. All of the lines were incredibly long and I felt like I was going to lose my mind. Then this little girl walked up to me, getting smart, and I couldn't take it; I was about to talk that little girl down. But I had to calm myself down completely, and then I realized it was finally our turn and I was so incredibly happy. When I got home, mom cooked bacon and I was just so exhausted and ready to go to bed."
535	18434	7	3	"As I waited at the airport, I gazed at all the people walking by and I pondered these thoughts in my head: ""When will Dad be here? How long have I been waiting and what time is it? Wasn’t his flight supposed to be here thirty minutes ago?"" Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice, ""Daddy will be here soon, honey, don't worry."" I don't understand how my mother told a four-year-old not to worry; it was in our nature to be impatient. I was about to lose my patience completely, but then I asked myself, ""What good does complaining do? It only makes you more upset."" As these things ran through my mind, I gradually gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing right in front of me, and I ran to him and gave him a huge hug. ""I almost lost my patience,"" I thought, but I was so glad I stayed patient because if I wasn’t, it would’ve ruined my father's trip home. Patience is a good thing to have; you can gain or lose things from it. In this case, I think I gained a wonderful reunion and a valuable lesson."
536	18435	7	3	"A time I was patient was one time we were at the store and I was very excited to go to the toys section. ""But we were going to have to go to the groceries first,"" said mom. I was really mad and mom said ""be patient, the quicker we do this the faster we'll get to the toys."" After we are finally done with the grocery, we then have to go to the clothes section. I was really, really mad. Mom said again, ""the quicker we do this the faster we get to the toys."" Next, I had to try on clothes. ""I hate trying on clothes,"" I said. Then I was very excited because we got to go to the toys selection and I was very happy. I looked and looked and then mom said ""I could pick out a toy."" It was hard to choose; I didn't know what to pick till I saw a cool truck. It had big tires, it had flames and it was green. I asked, ""please, please?"" And mom said ""yes, you can get it."" I was very happy. And that was a time I was patient."
537	18436	7	3	I was patient getting my new video game system. It took forever to get it; I had to be so patient getting the system. It took me ten months to get it on my birthday. He and I had to go to all the GameStops in Taylor to get it. I was in the car for hours to get it. We went into the first GameStop we looked at and they had one inside. It was in good condition. I got three games for it and that was the time I was patient.
538	18438	7	3	"Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a girl named Sarah. One day Sarah and her mom were going to watch a movie called The Adventure from Disneyland. However, when they got to the theater, the tickets were sold out and so they had to watch another movie. It must've been a bad day because once they got up to the ticket sold and remembered to go to! Sarah and her mom left and went to go eat. They went to a place called The Pizza Place and got in to order! They ordered their food, sat back down and ate. Once they were done, they left and went to try again with the movie. When they did, the line was as long as a mile! Sarah's mum just told her to be patient and wait in line without complaining. When they were there, they finally got the last ticket available. After that her mom said ""so honey, we were patient."" When they got home, they sat on the couch, got a snack, and waited for Sarah's sister and dad to get home. Finally, they arrived with a big surprise and Sarah's dad was holding tickets to go see the movie Sarah and her mom had just seen! ""We were trying to find you all day,"" said her father. ""We couldn't find you,"" said her sister. Sarah and her mom looked at each other and explained that they can go see the movie because they were patient and waited in line and got the last ticket available! ""And we won fifty dollars too!"" exclaimed Sarah. The end!"
539	18441	7	3	"I am going to talk about what I think patience is. I think patience is about waiting calmly for something you really want. For example, ""you were very patient in line for cotton candy,"" said the clown. You know something like that, waiting without getting upset or angry. I know this is a short story, I'm sorry, but that is what I believe patience means."
540	18442	7	3	"I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctor's office with my mom because I wasn't feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said ""wow, it's already been ten minutes."" ""I wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor,"" I said. ""I don't know but let's wait a bit longer,"" mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently, more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I sighed. What is taking so long? I wondered. Was my doctor even here today? I stared at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it, half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. ""Wow, it's almost noon!"" ""Oh no!"" I said, flustered and annoyed. ""Are we just gonna sit here all day?"" I asked. Finally my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. ""Thank you for being patient!"" the nurse said smiling. I smiled back. I had been patient."
541	18444	7	3	One day my mom said I could get this new toy at the store, but she had to do a few other things before we went, so I had to be patient. First, my mom had to go to where she works because she had forgotten something important. After that, she had to go to the gas station to fill up the car. I waited in the car, trying to think about the toy to make the time pass faster. Then we finally went to the store, and I got the toy that I wanted, which made all the waiting feel worth it in the end.
542	18445	7	3	Patience can come in different ways in life, and it offers several important benefits. For one thing, it can reward you at the end of a wait. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because the outcome would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process of waiting. For example, when you wait for something, you could do something else, and when it's time, you deserve what you waited for. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if you are calm. For example, some people can’t wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it, which often leads to mistakes. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second time wouldn’t be so hard because you would be calm and know what to expect. That is patience in my own way of understanding it.
543	18446	7	3	"When I'm being patient, I wait nicely and I do not complain. I like to be patient and I wait well; I do not get upset. Sometimes people don't know how to be patient and need to calm down, and sometimes when something is taking forever, I sometimes say ""come on"" quietly to myself. I always try to be patient at school and at restaurants, and I always try to be patient everywhere, but sometimes I can't be patient and I don't want people thinking I'm weird for saying something. I just wait a bit and I try to be patient. I have to be patient in lines at the fair, and at the fair they sometimes have very long lines. That is my goal, to be patient about everything, but sometimes I'm not patient because sometimes something takes too long and I just have to like to be patient to get through it."
544	18448	7	3	In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle. I didn’t get to sleep in very much; I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn’t going with us. We got in the car and drove to my uncle’s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing all the fishing gear onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle’s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle had to keep watching the boat in the rearview mirror. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about several feet long. It scared me a little when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the lake. The lake we were on is called by its name. It is in a specific location. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good number of hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. My uncle said a special word when the bobber was going under the water like a submarine does. We had multiple rods out at once! Several pike rods, and a couple of bluegill rods! I caught the biggest bluegill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life! That is about the time I had to be patient on the lake for hours straight, and it was a wonderful experience.
545	18449	7	3	One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out my Slurpee and got in line to buy it. Then an old lady got in line behind me. So, to be nice, I let her go in front of me. After a while, she found out that she was a dollar short to pay for her items. So I gave her a dollar from my own money. She turned to me, said thanks, and gave me a mint. After I bought my Slurpee, me and my friends had to cross the road. We sat there for what felt like a long time, maybe ten to fifteen minutes, but it seemed like an hour because we were so eager to get home. We finally crossed the road and walked toward my house. On the way to my house, my friend said he had to use the restroom. So we went to the nearby market. We had to wait for about an hour before he came back out of the market. He told us he had gotten lost inside. We finally walked home, and on that day, I learned through all those small delays that it’s tough to be patient, but it is an important part of life.
546	18450	7	3	Two summers ago, I helped out with the kids camp at my church. I was assigned to help with the preschoolers for the entire week, and that role required a lot of patience. They were very excited and roudy, full of boundless energy. They were always running around the room and shouting with glee. I quickly learned that I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children, as raising my voice would only make the situation worse. Later on in the week, I was put in charge of a young kid with special needs. He just couldn’t sit still and was constantly fidgeting! I had to gently remind him over and over again not to be so loud during quiet activities. He was very determined to get what he wanted and would become quite frustrated. It was hard to stay calm during these challenging moments. Despite the hardship, I managed to be patient and calm throughout. Eventually, the little boy decided I was all right and started to behave better for me. Now, every time he sees me in the church hallway, he says, “hi!” very excitedly. Now I am truly glad that I stayed patient and built that connection.
547	18451	7	3	One day I was at my grandmother's house to celebrate my cousin's birthday. He was turning eight years old. So we played games and played on the trampoline in the backyard. Then we came inside to relax and watch some television. We played with their dog for a while after that. Then a lot of people came over to join the celebration. We went outside for a third time and played more games. We had to come inside and clean up for dinner. We all ate a feast of turkey, baked potatoes, cheesy potatoes, squash, and green beans. That was pretty good. Then they wanted us to do a craft project. It was a jar with a candle in it. We had to cover it in colorful tissue paper and it used lots of glue. I had to wait patiently for my turn because I was the last one to do mine. So I waited and waited by the wall, and then finally I got to do my project, but I was the only one there still sitting at the table doing my project. It actually turned out pretty good after all that waiting. Being patient can get you very far in life. You have to be patient at a job, in a restaurant, and in lots more situations. So remember just be patient and you'll be okay. Being patient will guide you through your whole life.
548	18453	7	3	I am going to write a story about a time that I was patient. When I was eleven, on a warm July morning my mother was due to have her baby. I couldn’t wait; I was so excited to meet my new sibling. We went to the doctor's office and we shifted into her hospital room. My mother's best friend and my grandmother were there with us. When we got into the room my mother was having strong contractions; she was yelling, screaming and squeezing my dad’s hand very hard. I got scared while she was yelling and I didn’t want her to get hurt. I walked out of the room and me and my mom's friend went and got the baby her first dress from the gift shop. The baby finally came home a few days later, and she was always crying, needing constant attention. That was when I truly learned to be patient, holding the baby and soothing her until she calmed down. It was a challenging but important lesson in caring for someone new.
549	18454	7	3	Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentist’s office. This past Tuesday, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a young boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first, and I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain, clutching his cheek. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older woman came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision, as her need was greater. After the woman went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging happily about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girl’s tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy and excited she had a loose tooth. I didn't think it was fair that I had to wait another twenty minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didn’t mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be mandatory, as it helps us understand and empathize with the situations of those around us.
550	18455	7	3	One time my friend began practicing patience while waiting for the teacher. She was waiting by the classroom wall while he was talking to another teacher. She stood quietly and did not interrupt. After that, he was done talking with the other teacher. Then she was able to get her question answered that she needed. That is a time when my friend demonstrated that she was patient, showing how waiting calmly can help you achieve your goal.
551	18456	7	3	Patience is about many things. First, there are different ways to express patience. Second, people either have patience or they don’t. I admit I am one of those people that don’t have patience. My mom is always saying, “Hold your horses.” I know. I don’t have patience so why does she have to tell me I don’t? I don’t have any patience in grocery shopping; I can’t wait to get out, but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines—man, do I hate them, they take forever, wherever you go. Plus, it is really nice when you let someone go ahead of you if they are in a big hurry or something like an emergency. Plus, the goodness in you just can’t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you in line. So you see, patience can take a toll, or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patience has a lot to do with complaining. But not the way you think; when you are patient you don’t complain at all, you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especially when you are in a difficult situation, it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well, that talks about patience and how people deal, relate, and chill about it.
552	18458	7	3	I remember the time I got my new puppy; we had to be patient. We had to be patient because he wasn’t fully potty trained yet and he was crazy. My dog is a herding breed and they are known for herding cows. So whenever we used to go outside he would bite our shoes. I don’t know why he would try to move us but it did. We had to be very patient when we trained him; it took until he was about a year and a half old to figure out that he wasn’t supposed to do that, but my dog is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for any dog to learn his habits, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient, and it taught me the value of consistent, gentle training.
553	18459	7	3	My mom woke me up early in the morning and said I need to get up and get ready fast. I asked what was the matter and she said we were going to Potter Park Zoo. I didn’t know why, maybe just a sudden idea. I got all dressed and we hit the road. I wasn’t feeling well that morning. We got Subway breakfast. I didn’t eat my sandwich though, cause my stomach hurt too bad. It seemed like two hours before we finally got there. I was feeling better now. We paid and got a map and started looking at all the awesome animals. I got to see two giant wolves, snakes, monkeys, lions, peacocks, camels, and a bunch of other animals. It was so fun! We got to this bird cage that you can go in; the birds are just flying around loose! There was a little boy in there and a bird landed right on the top of his head! Suddenly, my mom’s phone rang. It was my brother. He stayed home because he didn’t wanna get up. I could barely hear my mom over the birds. She walked out and stood outside; I followed her. She was saying, “Stay home, because I said so; you don’t need to go anywhere.” Next thing I know she was hanging up. We walked toward the fish building when her phone rang. “Don’t ever hang up on me again! Seriously, I don’t need to fight with you! It’s going to storm; I want you home!” Then it starts pouring rain and my mom’s still on the phone. I was getting very wet and bored; I really wanted to see the fish. About ten minutes later my mom hung up her phone. We walked in, soaking wet! My mom smiled at me and said, “Thank you for being so patient!”
554	18460	7	3	A time I was patient is when we had to do MCAP tests. I was one of the first ones done, so I had to sit quietly and read. I read most of my book. It took about an hour for everyone to finish. It was a very long time to read. I got bored, but I sat quietly so people could finish, and so I wouldn’t be disruptive. Then when everyone finished we took a bathroom break. It was a good lesson in waiting respectfully for others.
555	18461	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was a little kid. My mom and my cousin Cindy were talking. My cousin told me to wait my turn when my mom and she were done talking, so I did wait for my turn. While they were still talking, I asked my mom if I could go for my bike. I told my mom I could ride my bike without training wheels. My mom came over because I was going for surgery. I was waiting for the surgery. The surgery was for my arm, which I had hurt. So I was waiting until it was done. It was a long wait, but it was fun to finally get back on my bike afterward.
556	18463	7	3	I tested my patience when I was waiting for a long time. You know, if you have patience, if you said for a certain number of minutes you're set at one time, you will know if you have patience then. I will be strong, but I get impatient at some time. You will never be all patience at a course or a new endeavor. I was at a place where I had to be patient to see the result; I got impatient, then I had to wait to get food so I could have something to do, for I wanted bread so I knew I had to endure until a certain month. That is how I got my patience.
557	18464	7	3	"There was a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when my cousins, let's call them @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3, were playing the Wii. And I said I would play winner, so my cousin @PERSON2 won and @PERSON1 didn’t give me the controller and she wasn’t sharing. Then I said she could play one more time then it's my turn, but instead she played four more times. I said, ""@PERSON1, it's my turn, you played and I didn’t,"" but she said, “It is not your turn.” Then her mom said, “@PERSON1, you can play a few more minutes then it's my turn.” One hour and thirty minutes passed and she still didn’t give it to me. Then I said, ""@PERSON1, it's my turn, and I’ve been patient for a long time; you either give it to me or I’m going to take it,"" but she still didn't give it to me. I had been getting ready and she still didn’t share. Finally, she said she was tired of it anyways. And that’s the time I’ve been patient."
558	18465	7	3	"One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for sixth grade. I didn't want to go but I had to; I didn't have a choice, so I got in the car and we drove to the doctor's office. Finally, we arrived. My mom had to sign in and we sat down. Even though I was waiting for three hours, I didn't complain about it. The doctor came out and I got scared but happy that finally it was my turn. Then he called a different name, so we kept on waiting in the waiting room. Then my beloved mother told me, ""Wow, you're not complaining now."" I know, I managed that because I am becoming more mature and I have a lot of patience. Thankfully, the doctor finally called my name. My mom and I went into the room. The doctor said, ""You've grown since the last time I saw you."" I asked, ""Doctor, is this going to hurt?"" He said, ""No, sweetie, it's not."" I asked, ""Are you sure?"" He said, ""Positive."" I said, ""Okay, ready."" So I closed my eyes and imagined something really nice. The doctor said he was done. I asked, ""When are you going to give me the shot?"" He said, ""I already did."" I said, ""Really?"" He said, ""Yes, look at your arm."" I saw it and said, ""Wow, I never felt a thing!"" He said, ""See, I told you."" I said, ""Thank you, you are the best doctor in the whole wide world."" He replied, ""You're very welcome."""
559	18466	7	3	"I remember the time when my older sister was so patient for her birthday on the ""fourth of a certain month."" Man, she was patient. Every time I asked her, ""Can you wait until your birthday?"" she said, ""Yes, I can wait until my birthday."" She couldn't wait until her birthday because it was in a different month until the ""fourth of that month."" She was so happy; I just can't believe that she waited for her birthday. She went to her friend's house, did some shopping of her own, and when the fireworks were in the air, my sister was thrilled. Well, that is how my sister was patient."
560	18467	7	3	"Ahh! I screamed in my mind. Babysitting my cousin took a lot more patience, more for her than for me. It all started on a certain date at a certain time; my family went to get some drinks, but I stayed behind to work on my homework. A little after my mom left, I heard a knock on the door. My aunt came in and whispered, ""You must watch the baby for a while, is that okay if I left her with you?"" I replied, ""Okay."" The baby was asleep for about half an hour. When I woke up, the baby had also woken and started crying. The first thing I did was pick her up and carry her around. Still, she was crying! I thought her clothes needed changing. I changed her clothes, but she kept crying. Now I had to keep my patience though, because who would yell at a baby? Then I thought she was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle though, so I had to read the instructions. The baby had no patience; all she wanted was her bottle. When I was about to lose my patience, I made a bottle and made sure it was good, and she drank it. Finally, I put her back to sleep, thinking if she cried one more time I would finally lose my patience. She was sleeping and looked so peaceful until she woke up again. She started crying again; this time I knew why, because she likes to be carried. By the time my aunt came back, my hands were sore. Although at the end of the day I figured out that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby, and you need way more patience for a younger brother though, trust me."
561	18468	7	3	I am going to write about a time when I was patient. My advocate was supposed to buy me some pens for many years as part of my money. I have been asking him every single day since then. “Did you do your daily shopping yet?” I would ask. “No,” he would reply. I would then say, “Please remember.” He always said, “because I want my pens as a present, remember the amount you owe me.” I would answer, “I do remember, but please be patient.” And I would think to myself, “okay, but my patience is about to fall apart.” I have been waiting ever since, reminding myself that one day the pens will come, and that day will make all the waiting worthwhile.
562	18471	7	3	Have you ever had to wait in line to get on the biggest roller coaster at a theme park? Have you ever waited until all your chores are done before you can play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I will tell you about one time that I had to be patient. During a routine check-up I had to go to the doctor to get shots so that I could be safe. When I got to the doctor I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was incredibly boring! And I was thinking, “How long does it take for a few people to get shots so that I can leave?” All I had to do was just sit there for about half-an-hour until my name was finally called. Then once I got into a back room I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end I got to go home and play with my friend. This is one of many times that I had to be patient. And at least I still got to play with my friend, which made the whole waiting experience feel much better in the end.
563	18472	7	3	I was patient when I was waiting for a chance to go to Chicago. I really wanted to go see the windy city because my mom went to college there. I tried to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked but once in awhile the thought came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didn’t bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I kept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didn’t care about visiting. No matter how tempting it was seeing a Chicago Bears or Blackhawks game on television, I kept my cool. Then it happened one summer, imagine that it was several years later and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nut shell no matter how long it took, I would be patient, and that resolve finally led to the trip I had always dreamed of.
564	18473	7	3	I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was my sister’s birthday. My sister was turning ten years old. We were at the local bowling alley setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was curling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said, “You have to wait.” I made a snobby comment and I sat at one of the tables. I was trying to be patient. Finally, it was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, my cousins and I all had a lane to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list so I had to be patient for a while. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and waited. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s so slow,” and I walked up there and shouted, “Hurry up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should have been patient the whole day and maybe I would have participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way, a lesson learned about the cost of impatience.
565	18474	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I had to train my dog. “Sit boy,” I commanded my puppy. My dog, instead of sitting, ran at me, jumped and grabbed the treat out of my hand. I went and tried to grab the treat back from him and he gulped it down. While I was walking to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolted away. After chasing him for what felt like hours he finally stopped and looked at me waiting to run again. “Come here, I’m done chasing you, let’s just go for a walk, please,” I said as I slowly lost my patience. I began to walk toward him again very slowly. I got close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolted again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. “I’m done!” I screamed and walked away with anger. I began to leave and go up the hill to my house. I went to my room ready to sleep. The next morning I woke up and went outside to try and train my dog. I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today I was ready to work hard and keep my patience. “Come!” I yelled waiting for my dog to come running and he did. With my first command I told the dog to sit and he did not, so I didn’t give him the treat. I said it again and he sat! Finally some progress after all that waiting. I gave him the treat and he started wagging his tail. To see if he understood I said it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that I began to ask him to do more things; sometimes he didn’t listen and sometimes he did. That was a time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definitely paid off, making all the frustration worthwhile.
566	18475	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we flew in the airplane from @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the school she asked us to. We flew to @LOCATION4 well and then to the @ORGANIZATION1 terminal, but after that it was all down hill. When we got to the layover at @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! After an hour I got bored, and having my little brother with us didn’t help at all. Then over the intercom we heard that we had to go through security again now and sit in a sterile room with just a gift shop for another @NUM1 hours. When there was only an hour left there was another announcement, and it was that we would be delayed three more hours. After that, I was listening to my ipod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally got to leave, we walked up to a six-seater plane for us to fly to a small island near by. When we got to @LOCATION1 we had to hurry to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours, and I was just relieved the journey was finally over.
567	18476	7	3	“@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3” I can hear the clock ticking, probably to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom building. Everybody is on the edge of their chairs waiting; why does @CAPS4 seem so long? It’s almost been @NUM1 minute now. The aroma of pepperoni pizza is so strong that I can practically taste @CAPS4. This is pure agony. My stomach rumbles, so hungry. @NUM2 seconds—can I wait that long? @NUM3, I’m not sure. The tension of the whole class is so great, I think my brain will erupt. I can’t take this; @CAPS4’s way too much. My eyes flash nervously to the clock. @NUM4 seconds—@CAPS4 seems to be an eternity. @CAPS4 couldn’t have been just a few seconds, could @CAPS4? @CAPS4 must have been at least years. @NUM5, why is time so short? I’m not a very patient person, not at all. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do, I’m not seeing @CAPS4 got. I’m about to just jump out of my seat as if I’m ejected from a @DATE1. I’m trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew that I’d be this anxious for lunch, I would have had breakfast. We’re down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4’s enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again, louder this time, begging for food, @CAPS5; demanding is more like @CAPS4. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,” the clock knocking me, taunting me. @NUM8 seconds—I can’t bear this much longer. I think I am about to snap. I don’t handle patience well. @CAPS4’s a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off. @NUM9 seconds. @CAPS4 seems the bomb and clock are counting down together, both anticipating my snap. I’ll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10. “@CAPS10!” Finally, the bell goes off signaling lunch time. I zoomed out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone, my patience finally rewarded.
568	18477	7	3	Some people have a lot of patience, and I am one of those people. I have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, and I was getting antsy. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom, so I decided to be patient and read a book. Before I knew it, we were there. Later, I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom, and we had already been waiting in line for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining, I stopped thinking about how long it would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2, and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. Another time, I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was only @NUM2 seconds long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headache. So I shut my mouth and waited quietly. I was glad that I was patient that day because if I wouldn't have been, then my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at the end of the day.
569	18478	7	3	One time that I was patient was when we went to the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. We had to wait in a long, winding line for half an hour. We were supposed to get on the cork screw ride, and I was very excited to go on that ride. So I decided to be patient and not complain. For @NUM1 minutes we inched forward, and once we got to the front of the line I couldn't wait any longer. So I hurried up and got on the ride, feeling a surge of relief. I really didn't like that day when I had to stand up that long, but I learned that is what patience means—enduring the wait for something you want.
570	18479	7	3	"On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in Little Traverse Bay for salmon, there was a tremendous hit on the trolling line. I launched from where I was sitting like a rocket and heaved on the line. I waited. I thought it was a false alarm, a snag, but trust me I thought wrong. The pull did a dance then bent really fast again. ”@CAPS2 on,"" I yelled to my cousin, and he ran back to my aid. We @CAPS4 stared at the water; the pole still flexed but didn't move. I was looking for the tumbleweed because I felt like I was in an old western movie standoff. Finally I looked at my cousin and said, ”I have been patient, do you think I should reel him up""? ""@CAPS3 me get the net first,"" he fumed and grabbed it then stated, ""When you are ready."" I slowly cranked the handle on the reel, tie, tie, as I slowly cranked him from the freaky depths. Then out of nowhere the steel cable that was my line shot from the spool like a bullet, but then a cynical jerk from him and the line went slack. My cousin and I @CAPS4 knew what had happened. The @CAPS2 I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters to frustrate more fishermen with his patient ways, and my patience had ultimately been tested for nothing."
571	18480	7	3	Quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me. I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when I come home, recounting every little detail. Once when we were sitting there in the living room, I was telling my mom the story. As I go on and on my mom has the patience to listen to it, never interrupting or looking at her phone. Though the story may have been boring for her, and extremely long, she listened, she made comments and never showed a sign of boredom. The expression on her face, one of genuine interest and care, made me happy to know she was listening. It is a wonderful feeling to be heard so completely.
572	18481	7	3	One time I was patient when I let a stranger cut in front of me to get some food at a busy food court. He seemed to be in a great hurry and looked very stressed. And when me and my brother both had to use the bathroom I let him go first even though I was first in line, recognizing that his need was more urgent than my own. In both instances, I felt a quiet sense of satisfaction from putting someone else's comfort before my immediate desire. These small acts of patience, though simple, can make a significant difference in someone else's day.
573	18482	7	3	"Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it, patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and test my patience was before a major college football game. One part was driving there. It was a complete standstill and people were migrating to the stadium! It took us an hour to go just a few miles! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game! ""Test your patience!"" my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another long while before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the excited state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience and focusing on the excited atmosphere. When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there, having overcome my rushed feeling and letting patience take over me, proving to myself that I could wait for something worthwhile."
574	18484	7	3	I was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store. She was taking a long time, trying to look at the whole store and I had to go to the bathroom real bad. I started to get real mad because I thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff tried to go slow so I couldn't use it. My foot was tapping and I kept sighing loudly. The only reason why I didn't complain was because most of the stuff and the basket was mine, and I didn't want to seem ungrateful. That was a time I was very patient, holding back my frustration even though it was difficult. In the end, I managed to wait without causing a scene, which felt like a small personal victory.
575	18485	7	3	Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of my grandparents right next to a famous national park. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I'm not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient, always tapping the steering wheel and complaining about other drivers! But once you get there everybody is happy to see each other, and it feels worth it to wait for the duration of the vacation to launch into our patience. And that's my story about being patient for a family event that is always rewarding in the end.
576	18488	7	3	One time I had to be very patient. I had to wait five hours before my grandma got to my house. Every hour I would go look outside the window to see if her car was there, feeling a little disappointed each time she wasn't. Eventually she did arrive and I was very happy, giving her a big hug at the door. Some examples to help stay patient are focusing on something else like reading a book or playing a game, going to someone's house for a while to pass the time, or even taking a nap. These are examples of staying patient and can make waiting much easier.
577	18489	7	3	My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to change the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and I’m not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very involved because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted one that didn’t break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make caramel corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you do one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, but she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go too slow, instead of yelling at me to hurry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must have taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a tremendous amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it. I also never wanted to stay and clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do, and I am very grateful for her kindness.
578	18490	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was going on the Raptor at Cedar Point. There was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored. There was some music playing but that didn’t really amuse us for very long. But I had never been on the Raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it, so I tried to focus on that excitement. One hour dragged by slowly as we inched forward in the queue. Then finally, after ten more minutes of waiting, I got to go on the Raptor and it was the best ride ever, making all the patience worthwhile.
579	18491	7	3	When they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food. Our time is way easier than in the old days, they had to work hard at everything while everything is given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren’t too many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny afternoon. I was starting quarterback and I scored two touchdowns and a passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up by a lot and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench, just watching the clock tick down. I’m not a very patient person so this was extremely hard for me. I hope I’ll never have to do that again, but I learned a little about waiting that day.
580	18492	7	3	I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, last November. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, sitting quietly and looking out into the trees. When they finally came in, me and my dad did not get one. Some other guys shot one and they all ran away. We waited maybe ten more minutes, hoping they would return, and then went in we were all there from early morning until late afternoon. I was patient the whole time, even though we didn't get a deer that day.
581	18494	7	3	One day, me and my parents went fishing. Our fish finder was going off like crazy but no fish were biting. It got to the point, in a short time I might add, where our dog would bark like crazy whenever we started to reel in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited, and waited, and waited, but still nothing came. Every once in a while we’d have to move again because of the current pushing our boat. After we’d been sitting there for hours on end, I felt something heavy on my line. I thought at first I was snagged on a rock, but when I started to reel in, the line came a little, so I reeled some more. I thought it felt like a fish pulling on my line, and then I called out, “Hey, dad, I think I have a fish!”. My dad told me to keep reeling steadily. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, “What kind is it?” He said, “It’s a walleye.” I didn’t know what to say. My first walleye! And dad even said it was big enough to keep! After that, then we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner.
582	18495	7	3	It was a Tuesday morning at school, so boring as usual, and my best friend came in on crutches. I freaked out and ran over to her, and she told me she broke her leg and that she wasn’t allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was hard waiting a whole month to hangout with her, but her safety was more important than my amusement. It was two weeks after my friend broke her leg, and I was doing well at not bothering her, so I was proud of myself, but I got to help her around school by carrying her books. It was a few more weeks later; she was almost better, so I was excited and went and bought her a small gift. The next Tuesday my friend was out of the crutches and the cast and back on her own two feet; that’s the story of the time I was patient.
583	18496	7	3	I am the type of person who you would call impatient, but I will try to explain it in the best way I can. The only time I am patient is when something exciting on TV comes on; I can wait quietly for my favorite show to start. My friends are always patient for everything, like waiting in long lines and for other things, but I am never patient in those same situations. I find it very difficult to wait for anything at all.
584	18497	7	3	"""Hailey, get down here I need you to open an envelope!"" my mom said. We sprinted down stairs because an envelope can only mean a report card, letter, birthday card, or checking account balance. We got downstairs and we saw they had a camera out, and the envelope had a sticker on the back that said 99.1 radio. We open it and it says congratulations you won tickets to the first official concert with Justin Bieber! I was just looking at them in awe, my sister was freaking out! Then, my mom told me that my aunt is going with us! Surprise just kept coming and coming. Another huge surprise was the lines; about a thousand girls were lined up at the front doors of the River Oaks music theater. Then security started to move and spread all the girls out; we got pushed about a quarter mile away from where we were standing. Two and a half hours later we were waiting, then I see this boy's head pop out a window of the music theater and say, ""Hello girls!"". After he said that about five hundred girls went crazy screaming. Another hour and a half later from that, they started to let people in. The theater was cozy and warm for being out in the cold for four hours; it felt good. Iyaz was the special guest to get us warmed up for Justin Bieber. When he got out every girl was screaming their lungs out! He sang his songs, and the concert was a great experience for my first concert ever."
585	18498	7	3	One day during the summer my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was nowhere in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing in my search. I stopped, felt my back pocket, and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it, when it turned out to be in my back pocket the whole time. Anyway, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stunned to see who it was. It was my friend Sarah! I answered the phone and Sarah starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad he hesitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hopped in the car and was ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing; I just wanted to hang with Sarah. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We went on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at Sarah's house. I was waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to Sarah's. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited when I finally arrived at Sarah's house. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait, and in conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient.
586	18499	7	3	Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced off the arm rest with every impatient movement. I had asked my mom to hurry up so I wouldn’t be late. I had told her, like I have a million times before, “Mom, you know how much being on time for practice means to me.” So I sat there slumped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens all the time, I thought my mom would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunately, with every channel flip, I became more irritated. “Where is she? Why is she taking so long?” Questions like these swirled in my head. Then, my mom came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys from the counter and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling anxiously, the garage door creaked open. My mom started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed I was for sure not going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my eyes and took deep breaths. Taking lots of deep breaths helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. “Be patient.” I told myself. “Be patient. Relax, you’ll make it there.” All of a sudden my mom slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read just enough. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself “see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and all you had to do was slow down and be patient. Great job.”
587	18500	7	3	I was patient when it was my birthday and I didn’t get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didn’t do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing; I didn’t ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing again. But that night while I was skating at Skate Port, I still had gotten nothing. Then, later that evening, I saw my cousin and she gave me some money for my birthday. I thought that everyone had forgotten but I was wrong. I was so happy, too. I had to be patient in order to get something and learned that you don’t always have to ask for something to receive it.
588	18501	7	3	The power went out in our neighborhood one day. One day when my aunt was watching me, all of a sudden all the lights went out. So I thought we blew a fuse, so my aunt went to go fix it and it didn’t work. So she tried calling my mom but the connection got lost. Then we got our generator and watched the news and found out my mom got stuck on the highway. I was worried, but then we finally got our phones to work and some of our family came over. We were so mad because nothing worked for a week and we had to be very patient throughout the entire ordeal.
589	18502	7	3	I've been waiting for like two hours. When am I going to get my food? I was hungry so I told my mom; she asked me if I wanted to go out to eat and I said sure and went and got my jacket on. Mom said she had to go get dad and told me to wait in the car, so I went and waited for them for a few minutes. When they finally got out, dad asked what was going on. He said ok and we went. When we got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside there were like a billion people in there. I was so hungry I could eat a pig, metaphorically speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about an hour, I started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about an hour before some people left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't ever talk at all, and I talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient.
590	18503	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to the doctor's office. Yesterday I went to the doctor's office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number a high one, and it took us two hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time plus the time waiting for a doctor was about three hours. When I finally got in I felt so relieved! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it because now I am feeling better and back in school, which made all the waiting worthwhile.
591	18504	7	3	Patience is sometimes hard to do if you are already excited, especially when you are eagerly anticipating a future event. But sometimes you are doing it, like if one of your family members is talking and you are waiting quietly for something else; that is a form of patience. It involves calming your inner feelings and accepting the delay without complaint, which can be a challenging but important skill to learn in daily life. Mastering this ability helps us navigate many of life's smaller frustrations with a sense of calm and understanding.
592	18505	7	3	I asked my mom if I can get a phone but she said no, not yet. She explained that I can't have one until ninth grade unless I get a basic phone right now, but I would have to wait until ninth grade to get a real smartphone. I told her okay, understanding her reasoning, but then I asked when she was going to get it for me. She said you have to be patient and wait for the right time. I told her I would be patient, but I still wanted to know when that might be. She said as soon as possible, perhaps on my birthday, which felt like a specific goal. I said I’ll be patient till then and will not bug you about it anymore. That’s one time I had to be patient and learn to wait for something I really wanted.
593	18506	7	3	One time me and my dad were at a store, and it was very crowded. There was a line about ten people long, and it was moving very slowly. My dad and I were starting to get impatient, shuffling our feet and sighing, so I told myself to calm down and wait my turn. But I was still not calming down, feeling restless and watching the clock. Then the very first person finally left after a long transaction, and the line moved forward one spot. Seeing this small progress, I was starting to calm down and decided to just wait for the next person to go, accepting that everything would take its own time.
594	18507	7	3	My finger tips were icy as I sat and waited in the cold. The seconds tarried into minutes, which then turned into hours, stretching time unbearably. My body heat was escaping rapidly like sand in the winds, leaving me shivering. I trudged through the mud as the slick rain hammered on my skin, a punishment for my haste. I should have waited. I was patient as they explained it to me earlier, but I didn't listen to their warning. I should have waited. I should have waited, the words mixed together in my frozen mind. My bones were cold, and I was only about ten yards from home, yet it felt like a mile. My legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself, trying to find a calm center. A cop car was in my parents' driveway, its lights off. I shoved my left leg through the mess of leaves and mud, knowing that patience wasn't a factor right now, only getting home was. Nine yards, eight, seven, six. I stopped, pulled my hood over my head but the wind and rain blew it off again, five, four, three, two, one. I was at my door step. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The door swung open before I could. Fast footsteps, then the door opens fully. I am showered with hugs. ''You should have waited!'' my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I smiled weakly, finally safe and understanding the value of the patience I had abandoned.
595	18508	7	3	There was a person named Alex. He wanted a specific video game for his Xbox console, thinking about it every day. But, his dad just got laid-off from his old job and his mom had a low-paying job that barely covered the bills. Since they had very little money for anything extra, he couldn’t buy the game he desired so much. A few months later, his dad finally found a new job at a local warehouse, which brought some relief to the family. But, Alex still didn’t have enough money saved for the game, so he continued to wait. A few more months passed, and with some birthday money added to his savings, Alex finally had enough for the game. His mom took him to the store to buy it, and he held the case tightly. He was very excited, his long wait finally over. He ended up loving the game very much, and the experience taught him that good things are worth waiting for patiently.
596	18509	7	3	Have you ever heard your mom or dad say patience is a virtue? Well, I’ve heard it many times in my house, actually too many times. Patience is something that means you have to wait calmly, like when you wanna go see a new movie on opening night. You might have to wait in a big, long line because it’s a popular new movie, and everyone else wants to see it too. So you're gonna have to stand there and wait with patience, without complaining or getting upset about the slow-moving line. It’s all about staying calm while you wait for your turn.
597	18510	7	3	A time that I was patient was during the summer break. My best friend was nice enough to invite me to Cedar Point with her family, and of course my parents said yes. It was a long two-hour car ride I think to Cedar Point, but it was fun because we brought lots of things to keep us busy. We watched a movie on my little portable DVD player, listened to music, and played some travel games. I had no trouble waiting till we got there because we were having fun. When we got to the hotel we picked our beds and then jumped in the car to go to Cedar Point; it looked so awesome. First we went on the Raptor; my eyes were watering it was so scary, then the music was so loud and fast I felt like we were going to fly off the tracks. Next we wanted to go on the Millennium Force, but the line was an hour long and we were stuck in the middle of it. So it would be useless to try to escape the line once you were in it. Then finally it was our turn to go, but the ride wasn’t working so we had to wait even longer. It wouldn’t cooperate so the ride operator told us that we could get free passes to go on any ride, and cut ahead of everyone else. We only got to do it once, but it was great. As you can see, us being patient really rewarded us in the end, and I think it was so worth the long wait!
598	18511	7	3	I remember a time that I was patient when getting my first silly hamster. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant, even when you really want something. I was very patient and happy to get my first hamster. I had to wait until the weekend to go to the pet store with my dad. And I got my first fluffy hamster. Actually, I got two of them because they were so cute together. And they are silly and they sometimes bite, but I was patient with them. And my brother was also patient when he had to wait to get his own pet fish. Patience is when you realize that you shouldn't get mad that you have to wait, and you understand that sometimes you have to be calm and wait to get the thing that you really want.
599	18512	7	3	I was patient when I was waiting for a guy to ask me out, and I’m still dating him to this day. His name is Michael and yes he goes to my school. When he finally asked me out I didn't know what to say at first because he took so long to ask, and I still did not like any other guy but him. When someone is patient they don't rush through things; they wait for something or someone, just like I did. When I was patient, I didn't ask him out multiple times myself. I waited until he was ready to ask me out, because if someone doesn't like you back the same way, they might turn you down and hurt your feelings. Okay, well if you don't want to take my advice, you might just get hurt, so it's better to be patient and wait for the right moment.
600	18513	7	3	I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting; I was only hunting squirrels, but still, it was a big deal for me. What I had to do was walk quietly into the woods and find a good spot. Once you sit down you can't move or make a sound, or you will scare them away. So I was sitting very still for twenty whole minutes, listening to the woods, and finally I seen a squirrel come close. So I took my shotgun, aimed carefully, and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirrel in the end. So that’s my story on how having patience can help you succeed.
601	18514	7	3	I was at the @NUM1 fair with my friends, drawn to a thrilling ride called the freak-out. The line was already long, so we decided to try some other attractions first to pass the time. Every time we looked back, the line for the freak-out had grown even longer, snaking through the crowded midway. We finally decided to just go get in line anyway, knowing the wait would be substantial. It felt like we were moving an inch every @NUM2 minutes, and I had to be very patient, shifting my weight from one foot to the other. On the inside I was ready to go nuts with anticipation, but I remained calm on the outside; it was the longest @NUM3 minutes ever!!!!, but finally we reached the front and could board the ride.
602	18515	7	3	@PERSON1 and his dad were planning on going fishing on that @DATE1 @TIME1, a tradition they both enjoyed. They got everything they needed: fishing rods, a tackle box, fishing nets, bait, and a packed lunch. They drove down to the familiar lake, got into their small rowboat, and were off, the oars dipping quietly into the water. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something, a ten-inch smallmouth bass. It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet today, perfectly still. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air, carrying the scent of pine. The sun was up but it was still a little cold, making the morning feel crisp. They sat there quietly, patiently, watching their bobbers. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line and quickly reeled it in. This time he caught a twenty-inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today hu?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a single bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sandwiches, chips, and a few waters. When they were done eating they went back to fishing with renewed hope. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go, the lure landing with a soft plop. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a strong tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad, trying to reel his line in as fast as could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it carefully. @PERSON1 had caught a fourteen-inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight,'' said his dad with a proud smile. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in, heading home with a fish dinner; @PERSON1's patience had finally caught him a good fish.
603	18516	7	3	When I was patient I was in a store buying something, and it was a long line so I had to wait to pay for my stuff I was buying, a simple magazine and a drink. I waited patiently, but the person in front of me had a big cart full of food and everything else, so I had to be patient when he was up. After he finally finished, I had to wait for all of the other people to get done paying for their food and anything else, each transaction taking its own time. I just stood there, looking around and practicing my patience until it was finally my turn at the register.
604	18517	7	3	"As I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I remember when I was six and completely foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on Christmas morning. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room in a huff. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep from the frustration. My mother had come in my room later and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as I’m older, I know most right from wrong attitudes, so when Christmas comes I don’t care about the gifts as much; I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want. When you're patient and listen to what your mother tells you, she can explain that you might not get a lot or what you want. So now my patience is great for most things, but since then I don't wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get disappointed. Patience is a thing where if you don't have it, then things won't be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them to. Enthusiasm is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don’t want to, while enthusiasm is when you are excited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and don’t say ""be patient,"" say ""calm down"" because they could take it the wrong way if you don't tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taught to act, so please take my words into consideration, as they could help you understand the value of waiting."
605	18518	7	3	Once before I went to @CAPS1 point with my friend @PERSON1 for a day of fun. I was patient on the long car ride there, watching the scenery pass by. I was patient in the long line to get inside the park, surrounded by crowds. I was patient in the even longer line to get on the dragster, the anticipation building with every step forward. I was patient to go on all the rides, understanding that the wait was part of the experience. Another time, I had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart. I was patient waiting for my results, sitting calmly in the quiet room. I am always patient, well most of the time. Once I went to @LOCATION1, and I was patient going through the slow security line. I was patient on the plane waiting to get there, enduring the cramped seat. I was patient to get off the plane when we landed, waiting for my row to be called. I was patient waiting for my luggage at the carousel. In my daily life, I have to go to school. I am patient waiting for lunch, listening to my stomach rumble. I am patient for school to be over, watching the clock tick slowly. I am patient to wait till class is over, focusing on the lesson. Like I said, I am mostly patient in these many situations.
606	18519	7	3	The best ride at the amusement park was over two hours long wait, which felt like an eternity. Bad news for me become I am definintaly not a patience person. Like this one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream cone on a hot day. There was only two people in line but I didn’t want to wait so I didn’t want one anymore, I just walked away. That’s how impatience I was, but riding the best ride in the world I was willing to wait, believing it would be worth it. Two hours of waiting in line we seen a sign that said one hour from this point, which was incredibly disheartening. Very mad I kept saying to myself it’s the best ride you can wait an hour longer so I did, trying to stay positive. When we got on the ride it was fun and exciting, but the ride was only thirty seconds longer, which felt surprisingly short after such a long wait.
607	18520	7	3	It's cold, it's raining, and I'm completely soaked; it's been one full hour and still no activity or movement in the woods. All I have to do is wait here quietly and hope for the best. I'm hunting deer, hoping for a clean hit with my new compound hunting bow. I'm a decent shot but not that good, so I need a close opportunity. I know patients is the key to deer hunting so I will just have to wait, no matter how uncomfortable I feel. I now see a deer, a nice buck, about fifty yard away and slowly raise my bow. I shoot carefully, and it hits true, so my patience pays off in the end with a successful hunt.
608	18521	7	3	Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago, right here in the classroom. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience and not get upset. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text, making the paper look quite messy. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page, using the wrong section entirely! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I would’ve failed the assignment for sure! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly, working on my test, she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face, pointing at the mistake. I knew that meant something bad was wrong. When she said I did it on the wrong page, I felt a surge of panic. I almost flipped out but I held it back, taking a deep breath instead. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right and handle surprises calmly. I’m very glad I have a good amount of patience, as it really helped me in that stressful situation.
609	18522	7	3	The time I waited for a party to happen was a lesson in disappointment. It was months until I’ve been invited to a party at zapzone by a friend. He told me the party was on a specific Saturday, and I was really looking forward to it. Two weeks he told me that, and still didn’t have the party; then he told that I had pay for myself accepted, which was a bit of a surprise. But it was a party so I didn’t mind too much, thinking it would be fun. Two weeks later I went school shopping for ten minutes, just a quick trip to the store. I came back he said he already had a party without me, which was confusing and hurtful. He wasn’t there because a party takes an hour or two so I just let it go, deciding it wasn't worth getting angry over.
610	18523	7	3	Everybody loves Christmas, and they all have to be patient for it, counting down the days. Especially on the night before of Christmas Eve, the anticipation is almost unbearable. Everybody in my family always gets very excited and can’t wait until morning, especially me, as I love the surprises. I get so excited I can hardly sleep, tossing and turning all night. In fact, last year had to be the hardest year for waiting. It was four am on Christmas morning and I had woken up for no reason, far too early. I decided to go back to sleep and did for only about thirty minutes when I woke up again, my mind racing. I just couldn’t fall asleep no matter how hard I tried! I went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep on the couch when I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there under the tree. I sat up and looked around at them, wondering what was inside. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait until everyone woke up, which felt like forever. So I tried to go back to sleep, pulling the blanket over my head. I would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying, giving up on sleep entirely. It was five-thirty am, and the house was still quiet. I turned on the television, threw in a movie, and waited for some noise from upstairs. At six-thirty am most of my brothers were up and I couldn’t take it anymore, the wait was too long. I snapped and started to complain, asking repeatedly if we could start. I had become very impatient, my excitement turning to frustration. I finally was told yes and began to open my presents, tearing into the wrapping paper. I was finally happy and content, the long wait finally over.
611	18524	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was visiting a water park in Orlando, Florida, we were waiting in line for this water roller coaster and the line was really long and they had this line called easy pass where you wait an hour, then go to this machine to get a eazy pass ticket but we decided to wait in the really, long line. So half an hour later went by and I started to get really board so I asked my dad if he wanted to play this game called slapps, which is a hand-slapping game. So we played for a little while and time went past and we were about half way there and we started regreting stay in the huge line because it had already been an hour so and we only move to the half way market. About ten minutes later I stopped playing slapps with my dad because my hands were beat red and his hands were barrely even red if that, so we decided to take a break from the game. So we just waited and waited until we were there three quarters the way there, watching other people get on the ride ahead of us. After about ten to twenty minutes later we were finally boarding the raft, feeling a mix of exhaustion and excitement. We went through a cave then stopped like fourty feet then splashed in to a huge amount of water, getting completely soaked and laughing. It turns out that wait was worth it for that thrilling finale. So that is a time when I showed patients and learned that good things can come from enduring a long wait.
612	18525	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we were flying to Hawaii. We were in the terminal waiting to board our connecting flight. God I thought how long can this take, just sitting in those uncomfortable plastic chairs. But evenaly the plane came and we were able to get on. Once on I thought ok this is the last plane we have to take today, so I can manage. But then the pilot said it was to be a seven hour flight across the ocean. Then I looked around to see what I had to do to pass the immense amount of time. I had my I-pod, a book, and the seatback screen in front of me with its limited entertainment options. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap to make the time go faster. But that only killed a hour so then I decided to watch a movie from the selection. I watched a popular action film. That took off another two hours, which was a good chunk of time. By then I was starting to get bored and a little restless in my seat. I decied I would read the novel I had brought with me. But after an hour and a half I finished the book and was left with nothing else to read. Then my I-pod come out and I scrolled through my playlists. I listened to music until lunch came a hour later, which was a welcome distraction. After eating lunch which took about thirty minutes I decided to watch another movie to continue killing time. I watched a long comedy which killed off enough two hours. Then with only two hours left I wanted to watch season four of the office, which I had saved for this part of the trip. Then when there was only thirty minutes left when they cut everything down for landing I watched us land in Hawaii out the window. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it, and I was finally rewarded with the tropical breeze.
613	18526	7	3	When I have patient is when I go out to eat, because I have learned that being impatient can cause problems. So no one can speat in, my food if I just wait calmly. Like one time I went out to eat with my family to a nice restaurant. And we all was dress alike for my birthday, which was really fun. So I ask my daddy to tell them that my birthday is to day because I was excited. And I wanted a piece of cake now, right after my meal. So he want to tell what I said and they said they would be with us in a minute. So I waited and waited, tapping my fingers on the table. And finly I got so impatient I said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place brun down, which was a silly thing to say. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen, trying to calm me down. So they finly bring my cake with a little candle on it. And they sang happy birthday to me, which made me smile. And I was happy after that in tell I found out they speat in my food and ate itto, which was a horrible surprise. I had found out because before I lifte I heard some people talking about how they speat in my food from the kitchen. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea, laughing about it. Then I said o I don`t care cause I didnt eat the fries, trying to save face. They said why I because I the fries is neasty and I never eat them. And I rolled my eyes and walked away, feeling angry but also a little embarrassed. But I don`t do that because I scared somebody would do it again if I make a scene. That is why I have patience now when I am at a restaurant.
614	18527	7	3	My friend was a person who usually was not very patient, but one evening he decided to order a pizza for dinner. The delivery man tells him that the pizza would be at his house in fifteen minutes, which sounded great. He was still waiting for his pizzas after fifteen minutes had passed, and then twenty minutes, and he started to feel a little annoyed. He wondered how late the delivery man will be and what they would say after being late, maybe an excuse about traffic. But instead of getting angry, he said that he dosnt care about the wait as long as the pizza eventually arrives, which was a new attitude for him. He just sat on his couch and watched television, deciding to practice being calm. When the pizza finally arrived, it was still hot and he enjoyed his meal, feeling good about his patience.
615	18528	7	3	We climbed in the rental car waving goodbye to realitives as we drive back to the airport after a wonderful family reunion. ìI canít believe that the airport had an opening earlier in the day and called us? Exclaimed my mother with surprise. ìI canít either. I mean out of all the people on the standby list, they picked us! Were here! Man that was quick. As we rolled into the airport smelling that familiar strafoam smell, and checked in our bags at the counter. ìWe need three tickets to Chicago, please.î my mother explained to the clerk behind the desk. ìI'm sorry according to this your flight is fullî she told us through a chessy, insincere smile. ìBut you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange our tickets for this earlier flight.î my mother replied, confused. ìI'm sorry ma'am it wouldnt be fair if we gave away seats that were rightful owned by other passengers.î she said again with another chessy smile, not helping at all. ìWell, you can have your orginal tickets back if you like,î she offered, for a flight leaving seven hours later. Seven hours! What am I going to do for seven hours in this airport! First my brother and I had races up and down the escelators until a security guard told us to stop. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere around the airport terminals, just for something to do. By the third hour I knew the place inside out, every shop and every gate. Soon it time to leave for our new flight, but suddenly the speaker came on announcing our flight to Chicago has been deylayed by an hour and a half. Nine hours now really? This is torture! Luckly my mother took me to an extotic restraunt in the airport to pass more time. It was a beautiful restraunt with fancy decorations, a nice distraction. Soon it was time to leave for the gate again. Please donít get delayed again?! I thought to myself. It wasnít delayed this time. I felt happy that we finally left the airport, but also a little sad that our vacation was truly over. I learned a great lesson about patience during that long day! Itís not hard to be patient, and it is not impossible, it just takes practice.
616	18529	7	3	There are some important qualities in life you need to succeed and one of those things is patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate them and when you experience things that are not ideal, you do not complain; that is when patience is. You have to have patience if you are planning on having kids or being a teacher or any other job; you have to wait in lines, for appointments, for results, and for people to learn and grow. Those are just a couple of reasons why you need patience. The final reason that I am going to say you need patience is because in life everything is not just handed to you. You have to work for it and to do that you have to have patience. So no matter what, if you don’t have patience you will have a really hard time getting through life. So these are all the reasons I think that you need to have patience. So if you don’t have patience, learn to be patient. I believe that you can do it; all you have to do is try to be more understanding of things and don’t complain about challenges that are hard in life; there is going to be a lot of hard things in life. There is only one more thing I have to say and that is just try your best to be patient every day.
617	18530	7	3	One day I had to put up with my big brother all day. He went to get a cell phone; I wanted one too but I was too young to get one. So when he found out I couldn’t get one he nagged me about it. I wanted to take that phone and break it but I didn’t because I played it cool, so when he got back home I walked away from all of the nagging. I went to do something else but he kept following me around the house, so I found a big tree that he could not get up to and I decided to hang out there till he left me alone. After that I went to go back inside. But I had got locked out and I thought to myself, man, should I have just gotten a plane to escape? Thanks for listening to my story about dealing with my brother.
618	18531	7	3	The time I was very, very patient was when I was about seven and me, my mom, dad, sister, brothers, and my grandma from up north, where we got my grandma, drove to West Virginia and back. Most of the time I was sleeping or waking up somewhere, eating, or playing at a hotel pool. We would sleep and then hit the road the next day. The thing that I had to be so patient about was that we were going to have Christmas there, so I wanted to open my presents. And one time we got stuck in traffic so that slowed us down about an hour or so. So when we finally got there I jumped out of the car, ran as fast as I could, opened the door, and shouted surprise Merry Christmas guys.
619	18533	7	3	One time when I was playing video games, I was waiting around the corner for a guy to walk around. I waited for like five minutes, which felt like a very long time. Then there he is. I waited to kill him; he walked past my hiding spot and boom, I assassinated him. That was the time I had patience during the game, and it paid off with a successful move.
620	18534	7	3	One time my friend told me to read this book, so I borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called “The Vampire Diaries”. It’s also a tv show on the television network. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named Stefan, brother of Damon, are vampires. They turned into a vampire because of a girl named Elena. Stefan and Damon died because they were trying to save Elena, or so everyone thought. Elena gave them enough blood so they wouldn’t die; they would become a vampire. They thought Elena was in the tomb because that was where everyone was taking the vampires after the town found out there was vampires there. Stefan came back after five years searching for something to help get Elena out of the tomb; I think that is patience. Waiting for five years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble is a long time. He waited a long time without giving up. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don’t complain while doing it, just like Stefan in the story.
621	18535	7	3	I remember when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy with his own projects in the garage, so I waited patiently till he finally had a free moment to put gas in it for me. When @PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had been thinking about, he also had to wait for the right opportunity and then he finally asked the question when the time was appropriate. Both of us learned that waiting is sometimes a necessary part of life.
622	18536	7	3	When I was @NUM1 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking my @CAPS3, “can we go to get pizza?” @CAPS1 every time I asked she would reply, “if you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza”. I didn’t want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 minutes, it got boring and the fun had faded. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water, hoping to find some distraction. @CAPS1 I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3. “@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?” I asked impatiently. “Were done with the house @CAPS1 the car has yet to be washed” she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat, deciding to go for a ride. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, @NUM3.m it said, and I felt a pang of hunger. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet, “Are you done?” I asked rudely. “You could help if you want it to faster” @CAPS3 answers calmly. “@CAPS4, fine I’ll help”, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows, finally contributing. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, @CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, “lets do!” @CAPS5 the whole day I waitd @NUM6 hours for my @CAPS3 and sister to finish @CAPS1 in the end I finished the job and we went to get the pizza, teaching me the value of helping out.
623	18537	7	3	One day when I was patient was when we all had to go on the same ride at @LOCATION1 @CAPS1’s out we where going to go on this one ride and there where tons’ of people in line for it and I had to wait patient in line because I was in the back of the line and we where there for about an half hour waiting for to go on the ride. The sun was hot and the line moved very slowly, but I remained calm. Then we wait there patient and the ride was dumb and it is not even going up @NUM1 sets of stairs, which was disappointing after such a long wait. Afterwards, we went on a whole bunch of water park rides to cool off and have more fun and then went home, the day ending on a better note.
624	18538	7	3	Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure, maintaining a calm demeanor. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do, like building a model or learning a new skill. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things, both in school and in personal relationships. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up and only makes everyone upset. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated, which I truly admire. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something before I start to feel restless. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done correctly and without unnecessary stress. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do manage to wait calmly. I think that patience is very good to have and is a quality worth developing over time.
625	18539	7	3	My mom was pation because when I came home late from the park she was be pation and did not get overly upset with me, but she wasn’t pation when she took the phone away from me she wasnt pation and acted quickly out of frustration. When my brother get he has pations for him and my sister but none for me, which sometimes feels unfair. Just because I came home @NUM1 minutes late, she said she had pations before I did that and now she has a little bit of pations for me just a little, showing that her patience can change depending on the situation. It is a complicated part of our family dynamics.
626	18540	7	3	"A time when I was patient is when it was winter time and my cousin and I really wanted to go outside. My mom kept saying, ""You will be able to go out soon, just be patient."" My cousin was very mad, she was having a fit, stomping her feet and complaining loudly. I was just sitting there quietly on my couch, calmly telling her to relax and remember what my mom had said. After an hour had passed, I was finally able to go outside, but my cousin could not because she was still too upset. She wasn’t being patient, and her impatience cost her the chance to play in the snow. That is a time when I was patient, and it allowed me to enjoy the winter day."
627	18541	7	3	One time I was patient because I was hunting; it was a cold, crisp morning and I am sitting in a blind with my dad waiting for a deer. It’s almost eight o’clock and we have been out there since before the sun rose. We hear the ducks and geese making noises in the marshland next to us, and we could see the trees dance in the wind. We could smell the fresh scent of grass and the morning fog hanging in the air. Then out of nowhere, around nine in the morning, a doe appeared cautiously. They went by us with caution, so I got the gun ready and waited for the right moment. Then out came the eight-point buck; I shot him through the heart and lung. I also gutted him myself afterward. That year during the youth hunt, I was patient and it paid off with a successful harvest.
628	18542	7	3	"My sister loved playing various games with her younger brother! One day when she was playing Sorry with him, sadly her brother was taking an unbearable amount of time on his turn. My sister was getting extremely angry at the table for taking so long, so she started to scream. As you can imagine, when their mom heard this, she ran to them with a worried look on her face. She questioned my sister, saying, ""Dear, what are you screaming about? I sure hope you're not screaming at your brother!"" ""Mom, I was, but that’s only because he won’t hurry up!"" my sister exclaimed. ""Well, you need to say sorry to your brother for being so sour and not letting him take his time. He’s younger than you, which means he doesn’t know any better,"" their mom exclaimed forcefully. ""I’m so sorry!"" my sister said with a tear trickling down her cheek. So they gave each other hugs and went on patiently with their game of Sorry, learning a valuable lesson about patience."
629	18544	7	3	"A time I was patient was when my sister got her license. When we got to the DMV, she pulled a ticket out of a machine and it said number fifty-three, but the screen said they were currently serving number twelve. I said, ""Well, this should be a short wait,"" but no, like every person ahead of us seemed to take half an hour, maybe fifteen minutes if we were lucky. We stayed there for three hours straight, just sitting in the hard plastic chairs and watching the numbers slowly change. I remember hoping silently that it would not take that long for my own license when my time came, but we waited patiently until her number was finally called."
630	18545	7	3	My name is John, I’m in the fifth grade. But the problem we have today is patience. One thing you have to know is that if you have no kind of patience, you won't get anywhere in life. Everywhere you go, you need some patience, whether you are in line at the store or waiting for your turn in a game. You will not have any friends if you do not learn to be patient with them. Patience will help you grow in life and achieve your goals. Let’s just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office in two days, you would have to prepare for a wait. So when you do go, you have to get your ticket number and sit down, and it might be for hours, but you can't just leave because if you do, you won't get what you need. Here’s another example: let’s just say if you had to go to the doctor because you're sick, you have to wait patiently to be seen, and you should because what if the doctor makes you go pick up a special medicine? These are some results and thoughts about the importance of patience in our daily lives.
631	18546	7	3	One time there was a huge project, and I needed to know what my grade was. It was really important, for it was the difference between a B+ to an A-! So I was vastly concerned about it, worrying about the outcome and the potential impact on my overall average. I was preparing for her to say my name, and when she saw my name on the list, I was so happy I got lucky on the paper! So I was patient in waiting for the grade to be announced, and I saw the result was good. I should not have shouted out, but my patience had finally paid off in the end.
632	18547	7	3	Being patient is like being a good person. If you are patient, then good things will often happen to you. Some patient people get good outcomes like moving to a better job, finding success, and achieving their goals, but some patience that you practice could also lead you to avoid bad situations. Ultimately, patience is a virtue that can shape your experiences and lead to more positive results in life.
633	18548	7	3	Patience is a talent that is difficult to master. Patience is a mental game that challenges your inner calm. Patience comes into everyone's life at various points. If you have no patience, then therefore you will likely have more anger and frustration. Consider the patience required for those minors stuck in a mine for two months, waiting for rescue. College takes several years of dedicated study, and patience is required there also. Patience is among people everywhere, whether it’s a child waiting for a toy or an adult waiting for God to answer a prayer; patience is something that will stay here forever as a fundamental human quality.
634	18549	7	3	This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the morning, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, vacation!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of summer, and we were on our way to the beach. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the DVD player for me and my brother Jake to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies while everyone else was asleep. Except for my dad, of course, he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to the beach. I was thrilled to finally get there, I burst out of the car and yelled “finally!” That was the story of how I was patient on that long journey.
635	18550	7	3	The first time I was patient was yesterday. Because we had to go to the next city to pick something up and it took about forty-five minutes. Then on the way back we took another forty-five minutes; on both trips it was boring. But I had to be patient. Also, just this morning I had to be patient because my brother was taking a shower and I wanted to, so I had to be patient because he takes like twenty minutes. Later, we were having chocolate milk; my mom was gonna make it and we had to be patient for her to make it. In all these small moments, I learned that patience is often necessary throughout the day.
636	18551	7	3	Patience is important. If you don’t have patience you can get angry easily, often over minor inconveniences. You will have a lot more friends if you are patient, as people are naturally drawn to calm and understanding individuals. Patience always leads to good things, allowing for better decisions and outcomes. A lot of times people are doing something and they get impatient, rushing through tasks and making errors. It would have been a lot easier if they were patient, as taking one's time often results in a smoother and more successful process.
637	18552	7	3	Sometimes when people take a long time my family is patient. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves, yet she remains calm. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that he is always waiting for, checking the mailbox daily. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother, managing our constant bickering. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end, counting down the days. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is taking a long time plus all the whining from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm always patient when I have to get the school day over with. My brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient whether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient, demonstrating resilience through all kinds of waiting.
638	18553	7	3	Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patience at many things. Examples of losing patience can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever, testing anyone's resolve. Having patience can be a good thing. You are calm and you don’t have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patience, because those people will struggle while waiting for something, becoming frustrated and agitated. In conclusion, I think that having patience will sometimes help you to succeed in life, opening doors that impulsiveness might close. If you are un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or you are waiting for will eventually happen someday, and your calm endurance will be rewarded.
639	18554	7	3	It was a light breezy morning. It was a Saturday, my parents were just finishing the packing for the long trip. We're going to a tournament because my sister has a lacrosse tournament in another state. It is a terrifying thirteen hour drive. We started loading the van with our suitcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the entire weekend. That is even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in our van. I ran back in the house and unplugged my video game console. I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on our trip. As we're just leaving I start plugging in all the wire and game controllers. Then we start off. For the first couple hours we just listened to the radio. Then came the effect of my brother and sister who never get going well in a crowded place, so we started bickering. Now we were two hours into the trip and we were in the countryside. We started seeing mountains. They were wonderful. Three hours through, we decided to watch a movie for the last hour. The hour went by like a flash. Finally done, that is a time I was sort of patient, managing the long journey without too much complaint.
640	18556	7	3	One time my dad planned a fishing trip to the mountains. I didn't know. He told me to pack my suit case for three days worth of clothes I said why he said we are going to the river tomorrow with your cousins and Ryan. I was so excited that I flew to my room and pounded clothes in my bag and looked through everything I would need. I asked my dad what we were doing there he said were going on a fishing trip in the main river for pike. The day before I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin reel. So I got my fishing poles ready packed my tackle box and went to sleep so I could get up early. Five am came and my alarm went off I was so tired I could barely see. We had to be at my uncles house at six so I had to get ready. Once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car but I couldn't. Once we got in the mountains it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even saw a bear near a river that we stopped at then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole with millions of frogs in it. When we finally got there my dad made me wait and unpack. Once me and my cousin got finished unpacking we went right to the store to fish. My first cast I caught a little six incher on a lure. After that we caught nothing so we came back up when it got dark and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake near the cabin we caught nothing. That night we went fishing on the main river and we still caught nothing. The guy that owned the cabin said we should catch four or five pike a day but it had rained seven feet so they weren't feeding. The next day we got up early again and fished all day. In the morning I had one hit we had nothing afterward. At lunch we found a little ledge to eat lunch on it had a actual rock cave and we had scared a bear off the ledge. Later we went to this little canyon that was really hard to climb I almost fell halfway down but I got hooked on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we video taped and we killed a chipmunk with a large rock that we threw down. Wham it almost took my pole I fought it for about ten minutes I waited and waited it was a gigantic pike but it snapped my line and I still have never seen that pike again.
641	18557	7	3	Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game with my family. It was almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field for the special kids' run. I had to wait a really long time in a crowded area underneath the stadium. I had missed about an inning of the game already just to be in line. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people all packed together. It was so crowded and hot. My mom probably couldíve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time, taking pictures of the crowd and the scoreboard. It was so boreing just standing and waiting. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked slowly through the outfield grass and onto the infield dirt. Most of us were on live t.v. as the cameras panned across the field. I was one of them, waving at the crowd. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game by one run. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field, a memory that made the long wait worthwhile.
642	18558	7	3	For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting, a lesson I learned from my grandpa. You must be tolerant and understanding, sitting for hours without making a sound. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst, you must remain still. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed, my heart already pounding. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunterís orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me in his old truck. The moon light shone bright on the frosty grass and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down and be serious. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was, not a single car on the road. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail, our boots crunching softly, and set evrething in itís place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air over the dew-covered grass. We heard a grouse drum in the distance and had a red squarle jump out at us from a branch, but no deer appeared that morning. After a long morning of sitting perfectly still we disided to pack up our gear. We always had tomarrow to try again. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time watching the woods wake up, and it was all because of patience. Patience @MONTH1 not always help in ways you wish, like getting a deer, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things you would otherwise miss.
643	18559	7	3	One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant, a big step for her career. After she took the test she was very nervous about the results. She waited and waited by the phone, checking it constantly. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients; she could barely focus on anything else. I understoond because I get that feeling when Iím waiting for test results at school. It is nerve racking and exciting all at once. The next day was not as hard; she managed to do some chores around the house. She just went on with her day, trying to keep busy. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would ever come, her confidence wavering. Later that day the phone rang with the important news. A smile spread across her face as she listened. She had passed the test with a great score. This is a time @CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days, a true test of her character that ended in success.
644	18560	7	3	"It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the effect it has on what you want. Even I lose my patience some times, especially when I'm excited. But one time I was so patient that I was about to explode with anticipation. On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1, watching the landscape change. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver mini van in a five dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1 entrance. First we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height, the people looking like tiny ants. After that we saw our cousins who were also visiting. I never even saw them before that day. As we were looking at the powerful waterfall my brother said, ""@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets,"" @CAPS4 my dad in a calm voice. We bought the tickets and went in the long, winding line. ""@CAPS5 are there so much people?"" I asked, my feet already getting tired. There was about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us, a huge crowd. ""@CAPS6 be patient,"" my dad replied, placing a hand on my shoulder. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us, a sea of bodies. We were never going to get on the boat, it felt like forever. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets to those near the front. After @NUM2 minutes we still did not get the jackets yet, barely moving. We were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were, a geological pace. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet, just a step closer. My brother was complaining about his thirst and my dad started yelling at him to be quiet. I was still standing, almost to explode from the internal pressure. At last, they called us up onto the wooden boat, its deck wet with spray. It was amazing going under the thundering waterfall, the roar deafening. We were in the mist, getting lightly sprayed despite our jackets. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was, the wait already fading from memory. Being patient has a reward at the end, a wonderful experience. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it and anyone can learn to. I was patient the whole time in line to get in the boat, and it paid off. Patience can be rewarding in the most memorable ways."
645	18561	7	3	In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever, counting down the hours. It was a cold winters day with frost on the ground and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day my new puppy would be home. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home for my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home from the breeder. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open, our eyes glued to the window. And the we herd it open, the sound of the car in the driveway, and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside, our coats forgotten. And there she was @ORGANIZATION1, a small, wiggling bundle of fur, the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world to arrive, a patience that was finally and joyfully rewarded.
646	18562	7	3	It was a normal old boring day in the summer, but I had just got a call from my sister in law. She literally just called me and asked if I wanted to go to cedar point the next day. I was astonished! I didn't know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding around the corner, but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so greatful I could not fall asleep that entire night. I ended waking up at five am and I was not to fond of that early hour, but it was totaly worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and headed straight for the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Half way into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. I’ve wanted to ride that one for ever. I was so disappointed. We waited patiently for around two or three hours maybe four. I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like half an hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law Sarah was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and Sarah, I think that’s why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day hind of sucked it was still our all a great time and a lesson in patience I will not forget.
647	18563	7	3	This year mom maryed my new step dad. I guess he wanted ous to bond so we took up trap shooting. It pretty much the same thing as skeet shoot, well actually is the same. Anyway he used to be a cop and had a shotgun so we went out and tried it. It didn’t work out. I missed every single bird I clay targets jet actped one. I only got one bb through the thing. But I was cool with it I new I was bad because it was the first time. So we tried the hit the thing died center. I feelt shown up by his skill. We left that day with only ten hits and a uncountable amout of missis. I was feteling pretty low. Within the next week we tried again. He lanched the bird and it almost like in slow motion I whated it ark across the sky. I followed it with the ball at the end of the gun an pulled the triserand I watched the bird explode into dust. Haha, I fanily did it? We lanched another and I hit it I went five in arrow! Amazing for someone who missed all about a few be for. And that’s how I was patient and learned that persistence really does pay off in the end.
648	18564	7	3	A time when I was patience is when our family goes to Adventure point. My family and I go to Adventure point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the Dragon Coaster, the wait was two hours, but we went anyway. We were about an hour in and then they had some technical difficulties which stopped the line completely. After about thirty min, the line was moving again, slowly inching forward. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted forty seconds) but the thrill made the wait feel worthwhile. A couple years later the new ride The Vortex opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn’t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing and incredibly fast. I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines for such exciting experiences.
649	18565	7	3	What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant of delays or problems without becoming annoyed or anxious. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining most people are impatient these days. Patience is like waiting calmly. For example, if you are in a traffic jam, in a long line at the store, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year more people become impatient. People want people to hurry or move faster. They need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down and counting to ten. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience there would be no more conflict and if that happened some day, everybodies lives would be perfect and much more pleasant.

(Cee-shen-tay) “Vince, my mami told me to sec that special beans get to Maria. Would you do it for me? “Carlos asked “cee, friends of the neighborhood has eachothers backs.” Thank you friend! I have to go now! Bye!” Carlos said as he ran off. Vincenta walked over to Maria’s house and knocked on the door. Nobody answer. So Vincenta walked over to the Miller’s old house. Abandoned,” I know! I’ll plant them here!” So he dug a hole and planted the beans. Ten minutes later he was still waiting. “Grow!” he yelled. Pedro was walking and soul Vincenta angered. ‘Boy, why you a screaming boy? You gonna wake up my papi!” Pedro exclaimed, “These stupid beans don’t grown Pedro.” he replied, “Why do you want to see beans? Go to bed they’ll be where under!” Pedro told him. “No! I am here staying! Eizel will support me on this one, haven’t you heard of that “Jack” guy?” “Fine, maybe will see you later Vince.” And Pedro strolled off. The next day Carlos walked by “oh my a god! Vince”he yelled. Vincenta woke up and couldn’t belive what he saw. The bean stalked ran right over the Miller’s two story house. “ You stink!”someone cavd right of a sudden Vincenta woke. It was a dream,he looked at the ground. “Nothing!” still nothing.   A day later he was still waiting hungry and tired, Pedro came by again. “Carlos doesn’t know, does he? Well, Vince please come inside and forget about the seeds. “No”, he screamed. “You’re just going to anger yourself “No! Go away! he screamed.”Okay! I will “and Pedro stomped off once again. Two weeks of waiting and finally something popped up. One was alive and lasted five minutes then died. The other was just a car bolt. Vincenta had bone bugs for the weeks and was putting inside air two. Then he asked himself, “Was it worth it?” cee-yes thank-friend. In the end, he realized some things are not worth the wait, but friendship is.
651	18567	7	3	Being patient is a very hard thing to do, and most people are very bad at it, though some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life was wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky summer day and cedar point was packed. There were flies everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away, and overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had ridden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem was, if you wanted the first cart, which I did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “Mom, can I just go ride the skyscraper again?” I pleaded. “No! We came all the way to Ohio; we are not going to leave without riding the best, funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” Mom quickly replied. “Fine! I never get what I want, do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want, but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over their arms. Heck, you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “Well, I don’t wanna put somebody else through that pain, but you I might!” By the time we were done fighting, there were only twenty minutes left, and we didn’t get the front cart, but the wait wasn’t even that bad in the end.
652	18569	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project, and this kid didn’t understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didn’t go with science, and he didn’t listen to anything, so he was doing it correctly but then he lost it! I couldn’t believe he lost all of our hard work! So we started over, and I helped him more and was very patient with him, carefully explaining each step again. After three long days, we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it, he presented it and got an A+ on it; he got an A+ on it, and it made me feel so good. I got rewarded for my hard work and for me being patient with him. To the end, being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient and learned the value of it.
653	18570	7	3	There once was a little girl named Kerry who was the important girl in the land of Narrative. Narrative was a little land filled with loving and patient people who waited for everything. And every child was patient but Kerry. Kerry was an only child living with her mother and father. Kerry hated being the only child, so Kerry's mother named Mom told her husband Dad that they should have another child so that Kerry would not be alone. Soon they told Kerry that she would be having a little brother or sister. Kerry was very happy. In fact, Kerry was so happy that she ran upstairs and began to make up baby names. Then she ran down stairs and shared them with her mother rocking in her chair. “I like Kevin,” said Dad walking toward the dinner table where Kerry and her mother were sitting. “Okay,” said Kerry cleaning the table. “Do you like Billy, Bobby, Ohio, Sammy, Tommy, or Ronnie?” said Kerry. “I like Lily,” said Dad pushing in his chair. “Me as well,” said Mother walking up stairs toward her bed room. “I can't wait till the baby gets here,” said Kerry on her way up the stairs. The next morning Kerry awoke early to see if her mother had the baby. “Mom, you have the baby yet?” said Kerry waking up her mother and Dad. “No,” said the Dad, “the baby has to grow inside of mommy, okay?” “Okay,” said Kerry. Nine months later, Kerry got up very early screaming, “Is it here, Mom, did it come?” “No,” said the mother lifting her head over her belly to see Kerry. “That baby will never come, I hate that thing, I will be lonely forever!” said Kerry walking toward her bed room. “Be patient, she will come!” screamed Dad from the other room. “She?” said Kerry, “It’s a girl?” Kerry got very much happy. Nine hours later, “Oh, oh, oh!” screamed Mother from her bedroom. “Are you okay, Mommy?” said Kerry walking into Mother's bedroom. “The baby is coming, call your Dad!” said Mother. “Kerry, yes, Mother is going to have to deliver this baby, okay?” Three hours later, Dad came home running up the stairs and went in his room and saw Kerry, his wife Mom, and the new baby Lily fast asleep. “Told you if you were patient she would come,” said Dad talking to himself.
654	18571	7	3	Some stories of when I was patient are when I needed a teacher’s help, when my grandma had surgery, waiting for my turn in sports, and waiting for my mom at work. When my grandma had surgery, we waited for three hours in the hospital. During that time, I played chess with my aunt to pass the time. I also talked with my family to keep our minds occupied. We went to the gift shop there to look around. Also, we went to the mall nearby to get some food. Another time, the teacher gave us homework and I did not understand a part of it. The teacher was helping a different person, so I waited patiently at my desk. I skipped the difficult part and came back later; by then the teacher could help me. Then I finally understood the homework. Sometimes, my mom took me to her job after school or I would have been alone at home. While waiting for her to finish work, I mopped the floor to be helpful. I rested my head and put it on the table when I was tired. I talked with some of the employees and passed time by walking back and forth in the hallway. These are the stories about a time I was patient and managed through different situations.
655	18572	7	3	A time when my dad was patient was when he had an important meeting with his boss, but the boss did not come yet. So my dad sat down and waited calmly. He waited and waited, and two hours later the boss came and said, “John, you wait for another hour because I need to talk to your wife because she is saying she really needs to talk to me.” My dad said, “Okay, but hurry!” An hour passed, and finally the boss came. He came and said to my dad, “Thank you for waiting.” Finally, he was done with his meeting. I said, “Dad, what took you so long?” He said, “Be patient.” That’s the time my dad became patient and showed great composure.
656	18573	7	3	"My cell phone buzzes in my pocket. Lexa, my best friend. I don't know if I can ever get over the fight that we had yesterday after she called me some names. I actually answered once and said, I need sometime to be patient. She definetly isn't listening. So, I decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring. ""Hey, Are you there?"" she sounds desperate to call me the nickname she always has. ''yes'' I reply. ''I'm sososososorry, I didn't mean it''. ''I told you I needed time and for you to be patient.'' I say almost in tears. ''I know but I can't be when I might have hurt my best friend''. ''Patience means that you are understanding & tolerant about waiting without complain''. ''I understand that''. ''If you would try to be patient and maybe you wouldn't be complaining''.  ''I'll try'' she says, then hangs up. Sure I think I am so mad that she thinks she can just apologize and it would be all better. She should've waited. I fonly she'd been patient, our friendship might feel more solid now."
657	18574	7	3	One day it was me and my mother we was going to the store, but first we had to go and pick up my big brother from basketball practice. We got there and he wasnít outside waiting for us. My mother was calling his phone phone and he wasnít answering, which started to make me feel a little anxious. My mother keep calling his number, her voice calm. My mother said that were going to wait until he get out, and we sat there in the quiet car for what felt like a long time. Now thatís what I call patience, waiting without getting upset or angry.
658	18575	7	3	There once was a time when someone I knew was patient. I was a cold winter day and I was at school. My teacher was very sick so we had a substitute. He was a very mean substitute who didn't seem to care about any of us. All of a sudden a kid started breathing heavy, his face turning pale. He needed his inhaler from his backpack. I told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no, to sit down. the person next to me said the say thing, but she was patient and said ìokayî in a quiet voice, not arguing. Then, after a moment, the sub let the kid go get his medicine. That was time a person I know was patient, and it helped get the right thing done.
659	18576	7	3	Patient! I was patient when I was waiting for my football game. It was a Saturday morning and I went to go get my shoulder pads, my helmet, and my pants for football. We woke up extra earlly though we were going to be the first ones there i thought wrong. There was like twenty people there already. I was freaking out man freaking out! I said to my mom ìyou said well be early you said well be the first ones hearî. Well wasent she totally worng. I was mad at her. We were the last people in line. All of thhe good helmets were gone. Mom said ìson, you need to be patient like the other parents. So i tried to be patient. It wusent working out too well. I was getting impatient,I was yelling, saying ìcomon we donít have time for you to be sitting around all day,we dontít have time to christmass. Finally when i got there i said out loud ìat last! The football stuff got mad at me,ìquiet downî I said ìI hope they have my size for my football stuff. Just what they didnít. I was really mad and just what she said ìcome back tomorrow and well have your size. Well thats my story i was kinda patient toward the end,but at the beging I was yelling and complaining. I guess that shows ya if your not patient youíll probley wont get what youíre waiting all day for, but sometimes you still might not get it anyway.
660	18577	7	3	My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and there was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, ìthereís one momî ìsweet,î she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at seven. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie ìNew Moonî I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so exided, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got there. This was the story when I used patience, and it made the whole experience much more enjoyable.
661	18578	7	3	“Can we watch @ORGANIZATION1.” I looked at the clock. It was only five thirty. “You’ll have to wait,” I said with a sigh. “@CAPS3 doesn’t come on till eight.” “@CAPS1 I wanna watch @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 z @ORGANIZATION1,” he chanted, his voice rising. Not again, I thought. Do we have to go through this every single day? Why don’t I still have any peace? I walked slowly to my room, my shoulders slumped, knowing I would have to keep him calm and occupied until eight o’clock. “Kumehnn, @CAPS2, quiet,” I tried, but he just whined louder. I was starting to get mad. “@CAPS3 doesn’t come on until eight, okay?” I repeated, my voice tight with frustration as I prepared for the long wait ahead.
662	18579	7	3	I am never a patient person. Whether it's waiting for dinner to be ready or waiting for a friend to arrive, I am never patient. The only time I can be genuinely patient is when I'm waiting for school to start; I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, or even years if I'm waiting for that. Then again, the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call, because I always want to be doing something every single second. I will run around the house for hours, pacing from room to room, until a friend finally calls. And when they do call, I rush right to the phone and answer it on the first ring. I will even sit there and stare at the phone, willing it to ring, waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for, however, is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back until bedtime just so I will never have to hear those words and clean my room.
663	18580	7	3	My cousin was incredibly patient when we were waiting in line for the top thrill @CAPS1 at Cedar Point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours to get through. My cousin was just simply silent the entire time, calm and composed, and just waiting without a fuss. I, on the other hand, was very impatient. I was tapping my feet, running around in the little space we had, and so on. I was about to die of boredom. My legs hurt from standing, I was getting hungry, and I was feeling too hot in the sun. I just couldn't stand it anymore. She was just standing there, not talking or complaining at all. When the line started to move, I got a little happier but was still fundamentally impatient. After @NUM1 long hours, we finally got onto the ride. After the ride was over, I asked my cousin why she had been so silent the whole time. She said that her mom had warned that for every word one of us said, we would have to do an extra minute of homework when we came back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework for the entire next week. That's how I learned my lesson to be more patient in the future.
664	18581	7	3	Being patient means that when you're in a bad situation, you don't complain and you endure it calmly. Some people aren't very patient and some are very patient. In my eyes, patience is very important, and I like to think of myself as sort of patient, or at least I think I am. One time I had to be very patient was when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1; it was not a fun experience. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom at the most inconvenient times. Once you have the privilege to go when you want gets taken away, then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself, be patient, we’ll stop at the next place. Another thing was you were always hungry or thirsty at the wrong moments. We only stopped three times the whole trip, and that was not fun. Also, whenever you did get food, it never seemed to be enough. But I didn’t complain out loud. Lastly, you just really want to get there; you couldn’t wait for the sandy beaches and the crashing waves. It seemed like we would never get there, and it was not the best experience. When we finally arrived, I realized that the entire trip was like a big test of patience and I passed, and actually, it wasn't nearly as bad as the long trip back home.
665	18582	7	3	"One day I went to the hospital, and the nurses gave me an IV, a cat scan, and had to pull tape off my arm. It hurt so bad, but I was patient through all of it. First, when I was getting the cat scan, I did not want to do it at all, but we had to, so I did it and was very patient and still. Also, when they gave me my IV, they missed my vein, so they ripped it out and put it in my other arm; I was very patient for the sharp pain to go down. Lastly, when I was done at @NUM1 o'clock pm, having started at @NUM1 o'clock am, there was a big piece of tape on my arm for @NUM3 hours. The nurse came and said, ""We can go home now,"" and then said, ""You can take the tape off now, sweetie."" I said, ""Okay,"" and I started to pull it off piece by piece. Then the nurse said, 'Here, let me do it!' She said, ""@NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6,"" and ripped it all off at once. It hurt so bad, but I was patient and didn't cry or make a sound. Now you know that I was patient even though I was hurt all day long."
666	18583	7	3	I was patient when my dad said he would get me some new basketball shoes. They were the latest style and the exact color I wanted, but the shoes cost a hundred dollars. I asked a few times over the next week. He didn`t answer, so I knew what to do to show I was responsible. I decided to wash the dishes every night and keep my room perfectly clean. I wanted the shoes so bad; I cleaned stuff that was already clean, like wiping down shelves and organizing my closet. After a month of the constant cleaning, I still didn`t get the shoes. Thatís how something went wrong at school. I haven`t been acting right in school because I was so disappointed. I realized I had to get my stuff together and focus on my work. Then I got the reward.
667	18584	7	3	Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before. Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin Emma to be born. I had to wait a long time, thirty-eight weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a great relief. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school today. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every single day I used to mark it off on my calendar. I used to tell myself every morning that she will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom each evening, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more and more excited. She had gotten a lot of tiny clothes from people at her baby shower. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to finally hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom every day. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better when you finally get it.
668	18586	7	3	Patience is a kind thing, people being patient, but still complaining about it thats not patience at all. Patience is waiting calmly and being kind while your doing it. People that loose their patience easily really is not cool, its nice when someone waits for you without getting upset if say your on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet or something loading slowly. Its very poliete if you have patience, I donít know the exact definition of it but am just gonna guess, I think its a person waiting patiencently and quietly on the other person even if they need to get somewhere or are in a bit of a hurry themselves. It shows respect for the other person's time and situation.
669	18587	7	3	"A long time ago when I was seven I was going to be able to ride on the roller coaster; this ride is thrilling for everyone, said Alex. The adventure park was a fun place with many exciting attractions. As I was waiting in the long line to ride the coaster I was getting very impatient. This is when my brother said calm down we are half way through. ""No I cant this is a long line,"" replied Alex. ""Well here is what you do to speed up the time, try to tell her the reason in hand on behave or talk with us,"" he suggested. ""Okay?"" replied Alex. So I was to talk to the people in front of me and we ever to the ride already in line and found out a lot about them. I thanked my brother for the good information. I managed to find a way to pass the time. Thats a patient time about me, Alex, and the help of my brother."
670	18588	7	3	Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you donít. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at Aunt Mary and Uncle John's, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly what happened that night I regret. My cousins Lisa and Sarah, and I were playing board games in their room. I couldnít stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over ìstiff upper lip.î I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didnít work tears rolled faster than rain falls. ìI want to go homeî I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin Jessica, who was babysitting. She finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said ìwhat is itî all grouchy. I had sniffled and said ìI want to come home, I miss you.î and sniffled more. ìSomeone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.î She said and hung up. I sadly told Lisa and Sarah as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was my dad, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in his car. ìWhy didnít you want to stay?î my dad asked calmly. ìI donít know.î And it wasnít brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks, and I knew I deserved it.
671	18590	7	3	I had to be patient many times. I had to be patient when my brother broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patient. When my brother broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the hospital waiting room. It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my brother. In fifth grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for four to five hours, but they were very good at their job. My mom and I were stuck watching the same show on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had a cold pack on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my fifth grade concert. I was so nervous and the nerves kept growing. I waited for twenty min but it felt like twenty years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I sang my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be patient. I am not good at being patient, but I waited and got good results in the end.
672	18591	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That one main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is Daisy Mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull. It all started when we took Daisy to the vet for her early check up. The vet said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side it means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed “Daisy is going to have babies” then I screamed with her. We went and got dog food and then we took her to the bark park and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now Daisy was getting bigger. The vet said it should be six months at least until she has the puppies it`s already been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now. I told my sister, that evening. “I wouldn`t doubt it,” said my sister then we went and took Daisy inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the vet and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if Daisy had her puppies today then I said oh cool but let`s not rush Daisy she`s going through a lot right now. Then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said “oh your just in time honey Daisy is having her babies” we both ran into the garage faster than ever Daisy was laying on a blanket, I rushed to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright. I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom Daisy Mae, the dad Buddy, and all six little girl puppies, Cutie, Boots, Tinker, Bella, Harmony and Melony. I love my dogs and the patience was worth it.
673	18592	7	3	On my birthday we went to go get a cake. I wanted an ice cream cake. It was over twenty people there. I did not have any patience. But my mom did. It was a playground near it. So I went to go play. While my mom got the cake she came and got me and we went to celebrate my party. It was a fun day that taught me a little about waiting.
674	18593	7	3	Patience can lead to rewards, Barney the brown bear learned that one day when he was in line to get an autograph from his favorite singer. He might have been very frustrated but he just stayed calm and looked forward to meeting her. One day Barney seen a big news headline in a newspaper. He put a coin in the machine and opened the newspaper holder to grab one, it was jammed. He went into the gas station to tell the people but they were not there, he hit the top of the bell and nobody came. Barney was trying to be as patient as possible. He went to a different store and got a newspaper there. The big news was that his favorite star, Bella, was going to be in town. Barney hurried to the town and seen the line that was very long. He was so excited to see Bella. Barney got to the line at noon and has been there for one hour and she only got a few autographs done. This was going to be a long day for Barney. Barney got a hot dog and a soda from the sidewalk food business at two p.m. Barney was still the last person in line his patience went down quite a bit. At five p.m. there were only five people including him there. He finally got to Bella at six p.m. Bella and her crew notified Barney that he won the patience contest. They told him he gets to see her in concert, gets her phone number and wins a date with her. He was so happy he kept himself patient for five hours. Barney was about to blow his top but knew he would never forgot this moment. Also, Barney ended up being Bella’s boyfriend. That is when Barney learned that patience can pay off in the end.
675	18594	7	3	When I was patient. There was a time when I was patient. There are more and more ways I get more patient when I’m not in no hurry to do something. I’m going to tell you a true story when I was patient. And I was not in a hurry to get it done. My first day at school and we was having fun with a bunch of people and on that first day we had work. When we started to do it some people was not patient. I looked around the bright room and I was thinking about how should I be patient, “just be patient I said” to myself I have to take the time and I could reach a good grade and so I was patient. The next day I was ready to see my grade on that work. I had a fun time and that’s the day when I was patient and taking my time, which really helped me.
676	18595	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the amusement park. I was patiently waiting for my turn to get on the rollercoaster, a wait that lasted for an hour and a half in the warm sun. I was also patiently waiting in a long, slow-moving line when I had to get something to eat from a crowded concession stand. Furthermore, I was patient when I wanted to get on any of the other popular rides, each requiring a significant amount of time standing in queue. That is a time when I was patient, enduring the lengthy waits for the enjoyable experiences that followed.
677	18596	7	3	A time when I was patient was last summer. My friend, Sarah, took me to Cedar Point in Ohio. The place was so packed, it took five minutes just to get from the car to the entrance through the throngs of people. As we got in, the place looked amazing with its colorful rides and cheerful music! It was almost like a dream come true for any thrill-seeker. They even had a small train ride to take you from one part of the vast park to another. The first ride we went on was the Magnum XL-200. We waited, and waited for about ten minutes and then things got boring as the line barely moved. It had been almost fifteen minutes and we weren’t even close to the ride's platform! So we waited, and waited about ten more minutes, and things finally got a little faster as the line began to advance steadily. At this part, the line was moving a little faster, raising our spirits. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We were assigned a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenaline already starting to pump. After we were strapped in securely, the ride operator who locks people’s seats said “go!” and we took off like a bird soaring into the sky. In the end, the thrilling speed and the incredible view made it worth being patient.
678	18597	7	3	Have you ever been a patient? Like at the doctor’s office? Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick with a high fever and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight, feeling miserable. Then my mom decided to take me to the hospital where she works as a nurse. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying, distracted by the large building. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me firmly that I still had to go see the doctor. When we went in we seen this man rushed to the emergency room on a stretcher. We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up by other sick people. When Dr. Evans came out she asked a man to come in to see her with his young son. That fortunate event gave us two seats to sit in while we continued to wait. After about twenty minutes she called us in to a small, clean medical room. She examined me with her stethoscope and I was really scared because I thought I might have pneumonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her small office I was holding my mom’s hand tightly for comfort. She came unto us holding a small piece of paper and my mom asked her anxiously what I had. Luckily she said I only had a bad cold and an ear infection, which was a relief. When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to stop at the front desk to pay. She only had to pay about thirty dollars for the visit. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went down to the ground floor, and went into the hospital pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full of people waiting, I felt like a pancake under another pancake in the crowd. When we finally got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop for me. When I got home I took some of the medicine immediately and went straight to bed. The following day I woke up feeling a bit better and about noon I got to have the lollypop as a treat. That was a time when I was patient through a long and frightening experience.
679	18598	7	3	"One day my sister was ordering a dress with a pair of shoes and a matching handbag from a magazine. But when she was ordering it they said the item was temporarily out of stock and would be delayed. The customer service representative explained that it had not yet arrived at their warehouse. You would have to wait, they told her. Rosy said, ""no thank you for now, I know it will arrive eventually,"" said my sister with a sigh. The next two months passed and the dress had still not been delivered. Then the magazine company called and said, “we are very sorry for the late arrival of your dress, and to thank you for your patience we will offer it at no charge.” Pleasantly surprised, she ordered two more dresses from the same company and they arrived the very next day, which made her still happy with the final outcome."
680	18599	7	3	I am not a patient person by nature. I hate waiting for anything and everything, from a late bus to a slow internet connection, and I often complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school, which really tests my limits. There are a few girls on my team that completely kill my patience during every practice and game. I am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way about them. These few girls are pretty nice people off the court, but volleyball is just not the right sport for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try to improve her skills. She even said so herself that she is going to skip a few practices, and that casual attitude was driving me insane. Another girl tries pretty hard, but she is boring to play with, overly controlling on the court, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball strategy. I think she made one successful overhand serve in all these years of playing volleyball, and now she thinks she can do it perfectly every single time. She can rarely even serve underhand correctly, for crying out loud! This third girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into dealing with her. She was probably the worst player on the team before, and now that she has broken her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and discusses plays with us and trys to act cool but fails miserably at it. It is actually kind of funny to watch sometimes. Now, I knew that these girls needed quite a bit of practice to improve, and I know it wont happen overnight as skills take time to develop. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them for the sake of the team and keep reminding myself to be patient.
681	18600	7	3	Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. “You can get it this time,” I encouraged myself. I stared at the net, a tall and imposing barrier. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing thoughts. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap! I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. “Come on, focus,” I think. “You got this!” my entire team stared at me, their silent support giving me a little more strength. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand. I will myself not even to look in the crowd, blocking out all distractions. My hand strikes the ball. It flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the court. A wave of relief and joy washed over me. Since I was patient and didn’t give up, I achieved my goal. This taught me one thing. Patience brings victory.
682	18601	7	3	Patience is something you have to work on. I do not have a lot of patience; I do not like waiting at all because it is not fun. I do not like waiting, because being patient is boring and five minutes feels like twenty minutes. Then when you wait you start something and then as soon as you start its time. Waiting for a package is the worst. You wait and you sit and wait, then you forgot about it and then it comes. One day I was waiting to go to my friend's house; it felt like forever since I’ve seen her but it had only been about ten months. I missed her like crazy. We have been planning this for weeks and it was finally the day I get to go over there. Now I was only waiting on my dad to drive me, and he takes forever. Finally we got in the truck, but the waiting wasn't over. We were waiting at a red light for what felt like five minutes. Then he gets a phone call and drove away slowly while talking. I swear we got stopped at every red light from my house to my friend's house and got stuck behind the slowest drivers so that made it worse. When we finally got there, I jumped out of the truck, ran through the door and down the stairs, almost tripping down each one in my haste. She practically jumped on me and we were hugging for like five minutes. That is why I’m not patient, because the waiting is always so agonizing.
683	18602	7	3	My story is about a time I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was Halloween and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn five pm because my best friend was going to pick me up in her pink convertible and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only noon, so I did my chores thinking time will fly by. So I did my chores, but my mind was elsewhere. Instead of putting dish soap in the dish washer, I put grapes in the dish washer. When the dishwasher was done I emptied it and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I looked at the clock and it was only one o'clock. Then I remembered that my favorite movie was on so I ran to my room but instead I ran into the wall and got knocked out. After a few hours I was fine, so I told my mom that I will be patient because I don’t want to get knocked out again. On the bright side I told myself I only have a few hours and some minutes to go, so I went to my room and watched some T.V. until eleven twenty, so I had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating. But first, before I did my make up, I went into the kitchen and I put all the grape smelling dishes in the dishwasher and washed them the right way. Then I put my costume on; I was a bumblebee. Then I put my make up on; I looked so cool. Finally the clock turned to five and suddenly I heard a horn; my friend was here. So I got in the car and we went to pick up Cate. I almost forgot to tell you that my friend was a ladybug, Cate was a witch, so then we went trick or treating. So that's a time when I was patient and it all worked out in the end.
684	18603	7	3	I remember, just a few days ago, my mother had to get her tooth checked out and guess what I did, I read a book! The waiting room was quiet and I tried to focus on the story. Even though it took forever, I was done with my twenty minutes of homework while I waited. When my mom finally came back we got up to leave and my feet were numb from sitting for so long. So far my patience was tested, but then we got ice cream as a treat. So you could get rewarded if you’re just patient and wait without complaining. It was a good lesson learned.
685	18604	7	3	I must admit there are times when I’m not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was. I was seven years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctor's office. It was around ten am on a Tuesday morning. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when an elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The woman at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait; she explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My mother told me to be patient but I didn’t know what that meant, so she explained it to me. She said, “You have to wait quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes.” I told her I could do it and sure enough I could, sitting still and looking at a magazine. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others who may need more attention. And I know other people are patient for me, so I should be for them also. It is a simple act of kindness that makes the world a better place.
686	18605	7	3	Being patient isn’t that hard if you try. It was a Tuesday afternoon and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for my turn. Five minutes past and they still weren’t done so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done, but it was only two minutes before class ended. Oh well, I guess I’ll give it another try and if I still don’t get it I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until the next day to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didn’t have to do that one and I laughed and told her I had tried to figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of being patient.
687	18606	7	3	One day I spent a night over my best friend's house for two days and ended up going to school with her. Mind you all of my clothes and shoes were over her house still. I wasn’t really able to get my clothes because right after school I went out to eat. I was really angry because I left my brand new white shoes so I called her and told her to bring them to school. The next day I was really looking forward to getting them and I confronted her about it and she says she forgot so I gave her until the following Monday and she still didn’t give them back. Notice I was very patient with her and this was the month of September. I finally got them back in the month of November. Finally she gave them back and you will never believe that I am still friends with her because my shoes were worn out and dirty but I had to realize that she’s a good friend and I’m a patient person.
688	18607	7	3	A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush because I was running late. It was Thursday and my appointment was at three o’clock. I was at least fifteen minutes away from the place. When we got there it was basically three fifteen, so I missed my appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time; my mother and I had to wait until all the people who made their appointment were finished. We waited at least an hour and a half. As I was being patient I talked on the phone and went on the internet. Lastly I listened to music the rest of the time until they called my name. In conclusion this is a time when I was patient.
689	18608	7	3	"""Hey, just sit down, my friend says. You don't need to be moving around like you're a fly on the wall."" I sit down anxious to get up and move again. ""There's too many people here we're never getting in,"" I say. The line was the longest to get my driving test, so I'm thinking to myself to get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend thinks its annoying and awkward. ""Hey, I wonder if they had a vending machine here."" ""I doubt it,"" I proclaim. My friend glances at me and I turn away. I got up and I walked away. I came back ten minutes later and my friend was gone. I sat down and talked on the phone for a little while. I sat and looked at everyone wondering who to talk to because I was bored. I wanted to get up so bad and move around but I would look like I was walking in a circle and plus my friend left. I sat and waited; thirty minutes past and we were getting close to 2:00 p.m. I was number fifteen and I'm number sixteen so I knew I was next. ""Number sixteen, you're next,"" I think in my head like, ""finally."" I get up and walk to the teller. ""Thank you for your patience, now how can I help you?"" I looked at her and said, ""Hello, I would like a driving test please."" When I got my paper to go in I thought to myself that I wasn't patient because it seemed like I was there for like a cazillion hours. I thought again and think maybe I was patient; it was probably the boredom that made me impatient because I had no one to goof off with. So maybe I was patient after all. I never was patient in like forever but I did wait because I was ready to leave. ""What was the wait? The driver's ed teacher says."" Honestly I felt patient enough to be there for about two hours. This is the time I never knew but now I know I was patient enough to wait."
690	18609	7	3	Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient you wait for something without complaining. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. Some people have good patience but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is what patience is.
691	18610	7	3	A time I had to be patient was at the doctor's office. The clock on the wall went around and around, its slow ticking marking the time. It was so boring I started to say the abc's forwards and backwards to pass the time. Every time a doctor came out, they did not call my name. I sat and sat with nothing to do, watching others leave. I tried to fall asleep, but the stiff chairs made that impossible. I tried to watch t.v., but the only thing that was on was the news and a boring documentary. Finally, after two long hours, they called me in, and I was so relieved the wait was finally over.
692	18611	7	3	One time when me and my mom were patients was when we had to sit and wait for my mom to get her new license tags because it was her birthday that day. So it all started that morning; we had woken up, ate breakfast, and took our showers. We put on our clothes, did our hair, and brushed our teeth. By the time all that was about done, it was nearly ten o'clock. After we did all of that, we had left the house and then we had stayed in the car for a while, just buying time. We had got to the DMV and took our number, and we were both hungry so we stopped at a burger king on the way home. The long, slow wait at the crowded office made that the day I truly had to be patient.
693	18612	7	3	Before, when I had to go to the doctor for a check-up, I had to wait forty minutes in the waiting room. So I just played my Nintendo Switch to pass the time. I was playing Mario Kart, racing against the computer. I got bored after a few races, so I just fell asleep in the chair. My mom woke me up because it was finally my turn. So we went in, did my appointment quickly, and went home. Then, at home, we had to wait another twenty minutes for my dad to get home from work before we could have dinner, testing my patience all over again.
694	18613	7	3	Last month, I had to go get a root canal. I was very nervous about the procedure. I arrived at the dentist office, half scared to death by the thought of the pain. There were two people in front of me, so I had to wait my turn, which made me even more scared. The time had finally come for me to go back with the dentist. I was patient the whole time, staying calm and still in the chair. After it was done, I was fine; it didn’t even hurt. When I got home, I fell asleep from the relief, but I woke up in pain though, my tooth felt on fire. I never complained though, and when my mom was trying to hurry with my medicine, I never yelled at her to hurry or cried. This was the time that I was truly patient through a difficult experience.
695	18614	7	3	This story is how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days. I have been patient by wanting to see what I get for my birthday even though it bugs me really bad! Also I’ve been patient because I’m having a sleepover with all my close friends. It seems like it is taking forever for the days to pass. At my sleepover there is going to be cake and ice cream! I can hardly wait! I’ve also been patient because I'm turning twelve, which is a big deal. Then the day after my sleepover my mom, me and my brother are going to the mall and then to the movies and I get a hundred dollars to spend. It is very hard being patient to do fun things. Finally I’ve been patient by not asking all my friends if they are coming, even though some girls forget to ask their parents and it bothers me because there is only two days left. This story showed how I have been patient waiting for my birthday, but you have to be patient to do fun things, a lesson I have learned just recently.
696	18615	7	3	When I was little we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally big enough to go on the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2! When we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there. The line looked as if it were five miles long, snaking back and forth behind the railings! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for! I was not going to miss this opportunity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking, step by step. It took what felt like two days to get to the top of the line. My mom and I were so patient! So we waited, and waited, and waited, watching the people ahead of us get on and off the ride. Till we were finally at the top of the line. Then we came down the other side after our thrilling ride. It had been worth the wait! we were so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great accomplishment of waiting so long. I never knew I could be so patient and my mom and I could wait so long for something we really wanted.
697	18616	7	3	Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear “@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2.” so I got up and checked it. @NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from and at @NUM2, all from @CAPS6 dad. I felt something was wrong immediately. I called him back and I hear “@CAPS1 get ready grandm @CAPS4 I coming to get you.” I said “it`s @NUM3 @CAPS5 are you nuts?” At this time I was at a family members house @CAPS8. @CAPS6 dad said “@PERSON2 was in a bad crash.” @CAPS6 heart dropped and I started crying. “Get your stuff together and I will call you back with more info.” I got off the phone. @CAPS6 aunt was up; she came into the room and I told her what I knew. I was getting @CAPS6 stuff together, trying not to wake anyone else up. When I was waiting for the call, everything went through @CAPS6 mind. I was just with him, what happened, is he ok, is he going to die? @CAPS8 I heard a beep beep, I said goodbye and ran out. Running made me think of more questions like: how bad is he hurt, what was he driving, what was he doing out? I got in the car and I questioned @CAPS6 grandma, asking her where is mom, where is @LOCATION1, where is @CAPS7, are they ok, when will I see him? All I knew is I had to be patient. @CAPS8 I got the call and I asked @CAPS6 dad “what happen, what did he hit, who called @NUM4, where do we go?” The first thing that came out of @CAPS6 dads mouth was “calm down, I can`t come home but @PERSON1 will be there, I want you to stay with him ok?” “Yes dad I will,” and dad I said “you…” he said back. I said ‘I love you.’ “I love you too,” he said. The worst time for @CAPS6 life was waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were @CAPS6 dads when @CAPS6 dad wasn`t home. I know I would be fine with @PERSON1. How will he act seeing his best friend like that? @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are firemen; I wonder if they knew who helped @PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hard to do but I had to be patient. I remember closing @CAPS6 eyes and wishing it was a dream. Now I get to go in; @PERSON1 was right behind me walking. I saw all the glass on him. @CAPS8 dayna said look who is here; he opened his eyes and they got really big when he seen me. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said “@PERSON1 come here.” @PERSON1 went. @PERSON2 said ‘thank you for taking care of @CAPS6 little sister, I love you man.’ That is the time in @CAPS6 life I had to be patient to see @CAPS6 brother. I didn’t care how he looked as long as he is ok.
698	18617	7	3	There is this little patience I use a lot; I called it hunting patience. On @DATE1 my dad and I were hunting in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. we got into our stands looking over a @NUM1 yard bean field, and not @NUM2 hours later two does walked in from our left; they were coming close to @CAPS2. I was about to draw my bow when I look around and saw my dad waiting for @CAPS2 to shoot, but when I look in the forest corner of our field I saw a big six point buck standing there not moving. I decided to be patient and see if the buck would come in. I saw a deer move into my blind spot where I couldn’t see it; I thought it might leave like that buck last year in my blind spot too. I waited for @NUM3 minutes, just when I thought he left I saw him again coming right for us. It was at @NUM4 yards, then @NUM5, then @NUM6 and stopped. I looked at my dad and nodded to give him the sign to shoot. He understood, drew back his bow and let that arrow fly. The arrow sailed into the deer and at that moment I know that because of patience we will have some good eating tonight with a party to honor the good days of hunting.
699	18618	7	3	It was a bright sunny day, and I was playing with my play dough. Finally I finished making my tower; it took an hour of careful fixing. I started at it in amazement. I was proud, very proud of myself. I got out a piece of play dough and I made it into the “@CAPS1”. I put it on the top of the tower. Well my five minutes of amazement was near its end @CAPS2! I look up to see that my tower was ruined, smashed flat. I look in front of me and see my neighbor. I told him why did he do that; he said because it`s fun. I told him it`s fun for you but not for me. It took me an hour to finish it; it`s a good thing I was patient and did not get too angry. He looked down and said @CAPS3 sorry for what I did. I told him it all right, how about if we build it again but even better together. He agreed and we both set to work. See how patience is important; the problem could have become bigger if I had yelled. We ended up having a fun time building it again.
700	18619	7	3	Once in @NUM1 grade my teacher @PERSON1 asked us to “get an A.M.P out.” @CAPS1 we all did and quietly we started to work on our math sheets. All of a sudden I was on my last problem and I was thinking “man, already to the end.” @CAPS1 I started to work on it but I was @CAPS1 confused; this problem was like seventh grade work. @CAPS1 I raised my hand and waited for @PERSON1 to call on me. She saw my hand and told me to go on in my math, but I told her “I can’t go on, I am stuck on my last problem.” @CAPS2 @PERSON1 went on helping all of the other students and I was waiting and waiting, trying to figure it out myself. Finally after she went to eight other people, she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem step by step and I figured it out. That was the time I waited patiently for my turn and learned a new way to solve a difficult problem.
701	18620	7	3	Well, one day I saw a commercial on the awesome xbox @NUM1. The commercial said it would be out in @NUM2 weeks. @NUM2 weeks ìI thought well thatís going to take forever so I waited and waited and waited. I kept checking the calendar, counting down the days, but it felt so slow. I glamced at the clock. It said @NUM4, ìI said,î @CAPS1 only been @NUM5 minutes. So I started to play a game and I forgot about the xbox @NUM1, becoming completely absorbed in it. My dad said that we were going shopping to get my x-box. Iím like, wow did it fly by. I guess if you donít think about it and be patient it will be over in no time, and you might even be pleasantly surprised when the wait is finally over.
702	18621	7	3	One day my sister had a volley ball tournament. It lasts all day. I just got there the worst time and wary for it to end. The gym was loud and hot, and I had nothing to do but watch. I canít complain or I will get in trouble I just have to be patient, sitting quietly in the stands. I am very patient now because she has a lot of tournaments, so I have had plenty of practice. When there are finally over my mom usually ?? me for being  good the whole time, which makes the long wait feel a little more worthwhile. As you can see being patient is hard but it is a very important trait to have, and it’s something you get better at with time.
703	18622	7	3	This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every @NUM1 months. Me, my brothers and my sister and it takes about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. The waiting room is always crowded and the chairs are uncomfortable. When the doctor ask my brothers questions when he says then I am already coming up with my answer and then its my turn, but before my turn @NUM4 sce the doctor I was ireally patient, trying not to fidget. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with, which felt much longer. Then he has to talk to my mom that comes my time with lls, and I have to wait even more. When we do to the doctor or dentist we and really patient but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do, and being impatient doesn't make it go any faster.
704	18624	7	3	Once on @DATE1 break my family and I went to @LOCATION1. While we were at @LOCATION1 we went to a huge water park. My two sisters and I convinced my parents to go there, promising we would behave. A few days later we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothing, and started looking for waterslides. Right as we walked in there was a huge (take) sunken ship. On the very to where zip- lines! We all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line. Not a short line. A giant line that snaked around the deck. We must have been there @NUM1 minutes waiting, watching person after person go. Eventually it came my turn. I grabbed the handle and kicked off the ground. I had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. I let go falling into a pool. The wait was totally worth it for that thrilling ride!
705	18626	7	3	ìPatience is a virtue.î You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Hereís a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, Iím going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, itís very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1î services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience, expecting everything instantly. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money, as success rarely happens overnight. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members, who can be frustrating. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I canít deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way in the future. Those are the proís and conís of having patience thank you for reading my essay and considering its points.
706	18627	7	3	One time when I was patient is when I was a little kid and my mom said we were going on a trip to visit my cousins in Texas. I was just a little kid so I was very excited to take my first plane ride. I remember fidgeting in my seat and looking out the window at the clouds below. When we finally got to the hotel I was so excited. I asked my mom when we got to the hotel can I go swimming. She told me to just be patient and wait until we were all unpacked. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could be, sitting on the edge of the bed and watching the clock, then I couldn’t wait anymore. So I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. The water felt wonderful after the long journey. And that was a time when I was patient for something.
707	18628	7	3	I am going to be writing a time when I was patient. Me and my family went to Cedar Point and it was this ride called the Millennium Force, the best and highest roller coaster at Cedar Point. So we got in line it was so long we had to wait for hours to get on the ride, because the line was so long and winding. So I had my uncle who wasn't getting on the ride to go get me some pop, elephant ears, and some chips because I was so hungry and thirsty from the wait. So while I was being patient, calmly eating my snack, my other family was not being very patient. I was the only one patient. So thirty minutes past we still in line my family started fussing and complaining about the slow movement. One hour past they were getting madder, sighing loudly and shifting their weight from foot to foot. Then two hours came we were starting to be able to see the roller coaster and people getting on and off, which gave us a little hope. So finally, we got on the ride, we enjoyed it and the thrill was worth the long wait. Then I had to explain how patient I was and how impatient they were not.
708	18629	7	3	One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He thought that everything he wanted would come to him right away. His name was John. John soon realized that not everything came right when he wanted it, which was a frustrating lesson for him. So he got really mad when he saw a house for sale, it was a really nice house with a big garden and a new roof. But the people living in the house weren’t done moving everything out of the house and needed a few more days. He paced back and forth, grumbling about the delay. Then he discovered that patience is key and that when it’s time to move in he will, and everything will work out as it should. So from that point on he learned to wait calmly and was always patient for the rest of his life.
709	18630	7	3	This is a time I was patient. It was a Saturday afternoon on my birthday, we had five boys at my house. We all wanted to play Xbox. Only have two controllers. So you know the rule let your guests go first! They all played for what felt like forever. Twenty minutes! I had to wait twenty minutes to play my own game! All my friends were lucky I was patient. I hated sitting there it got me mad plus after a while they didn't even want to play anymore. So I asked my friends Mike and Chris if they would play a racing game with me. They said yes so after waiting all those minutes and then nobody wanted to play anymore. It made me feel pretty bad! It was my birthday you can't play a little? I felt good I stayed patient and didn’t go berserk. This is a time I stayed patient on my special day.
710	18631	7	3	"The clock is ticking down, waiting, ready, ready to burst into a frenzy. A never before been seen explosive device, the bomb is planted at the white house, patience is key because with this device, anybody that attempts to defuse this bomb except from the last minute of the count down to certain destruction will detonate this explosive. The alpha team says is waiting, waiting for the right time to make their move. Ten minutes left, five minutes left, three minutes left, one minute left. ""Now, now!"" yelled Alex, the leader of the saved. This our only chance to save the white house. Time is running out, thirty seconds of the entire operation riding on our shoulders, the fate of the white house is in our hands. The enemies are calling in reinforcements, just as all hope is lost, ""I got it!"" I exclaimed as I located the correct wire. All that was left was to cut it and let the army do the work. We rushed to the van with our shields out and pummeled through the defenses. Suddenly, we heard a strong noise and we noticed a charge on the bottom of the van, we ran for our lives as our night equipped van exploded to pieces right behind us. We hid patiently waiting for the patrol to walk by, our hearts pounding in our chests. We just need to cross the field to the army helicopter and were home free. We sprint across the field and victory is ours. A sense of accomplishment and greatness rushes through me as we complete the mission."
711	18632	7	3	It was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I was up watching tv waiting an waiting for @CAPS1 and I was being patient and not pouty because I wanted @LOCATION1 to come to my house and, they were playing @CAPS1 tv shows and it was making me so excited and it felt like my heal was about to burst but I being patient, sitting quietly and just watching the screen. Then my mom said it was time to go to bed so I because I wanted @LOCATION1 to come to my house. But the only problem is I couldnt sleep so I went to get a glass of water and I turned on the tv queitly and on acident I feel asleep on the couch and next thing I new it was @CAPS1 and the had went by so fast that it felt like it was @CAPS1 in @NUM1 minutes, a sudden and joyful surprise. Because I was patient, the wait felt much shorter in the end.
712	18633	7	3	I have been patient many time here are a few of them. First, I was patient for my friend. I patient with him because we were going to walk to school. He told me one minute, but it was more like twenty, and I just waited by the door without complaining. We barely made it to first hour. Another way I was patient was when my mom and I went to go get my new shoes from @ORGANIZATION1. When my mom and I were waiting the man in the store went to go get the shoes. The man walked back there and took like a half an hour, looking through the back room for the right size. But it was worth it for my new shoes, which fit perfectly. These are only a few ways I was patient, showing I can wait calmly when I need to.
713	18634	7	3	Patience is like waiting for something and not froaring out. Imagine if no one had patience everything would suck, it would be pure chaos all the time. Picture this your at the store there is a line at the register, no patience and people are fighting to get to it, pushing and shoving to be first. Knowing that most people have patience that would not happen, they just wait their turn quietly. Since the people have patience the world has order so if you think about it it's a good thing, a simple virtue that keeps everything running smoothly for everyone.
714	18635	7	3	A time when I was patient was on the city bus. So me and my mom could go to walmart. We waited for @NUM1 hours till we got there, just looking out the window as the city passed by. Before we got on we had to pay a @MONEY1 each, which we did without any fuss. Then ask for transfer very nicely, and the driver handed us the small paper slips. T hen hop on another bus then get off and go shopping, walking through the automatic doors. Then wait till bus comes back and go home after @NUM1 hours, another long ride sitting quietly. Then get of bus at the corner and walk back to the house, finally arriving after a long day of waiting.
715	18636	7	3	Just before @DATE2 break, in the fourth grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighborís house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didnít have plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room, its lights twinkling brightly. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didnít understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait, placing the gift on my dresser at home. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on, each one feeling longer than the last. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient, looking at the wrapped box every day. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1, my fingers itching to pull the paper. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper awayÖ and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders, a beautiful book for my thoughts. Inside was a note: @CAPS7 only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience, a lesson I finally understood and appreciated. Now I understood the true value of waiting.
716	18637	7	3	"This is the time when I was patient. One Saturday day I was playing with my Nintendo DS game, I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my games were kinda old. My mum said ""Honey sweetie just be patient"" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine she got that to. So I just keep waiting and I was also patient. My dad came back from work, and I asked him. I said, ""dad can you get me a new Nintendo DS game?"" ""Honey honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" ""ugh okay!"" I hollered to the next day my dad had already gotten what my brothe and sister wanted, and I was the only one who my dad and mom that never gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard just takes patience. Thats how patience helps you ecomplish what you want."
717	18638	7	3	To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at a airport then canceld it was not very fun because I didnít eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my ds. The story was we went to Florida on the fifth for vacation to disney land. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security line. When we got to the boarding gat we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed that ment we had to stay here in the airport. I aleast saw that we were going to new York first then to Florida but I stayed patient. We waited for hours, playing my DS to pass the time. Well thatís the day I stayed very very patient, and I learned that patience makes a difficult situation easier to bear.
718	18639	7	3	"I was patient for my birthday present. It was almost my birthday and I m kept asking for birthday presents, but my mom kept saying no. it was getting closer and closer and I kept asking, until my mom said be patient you will get them don't worry, but of course I had a hard  time being patient. Final it was the night before and I couldn't wait but I had to. That night I went to bed I asked once more and again she said no. The morning come and I went to school. I was so happy because today was my birthday and I got present's to open, I got home and my mom was waiting with a cake and a present, she said ""there are more "". I was so excited to see all the gifts. That was the t i tryed being patient and it was worth it in the end."
719	18640	7	3	It was a dark saddanly night we went to go pick up some subway for my family. Boom, a struck of lightning hit every thing went dark. The manger came out every body be calme she and use navy blue flash lights we couldn‚Äôt get to our car because it was raining & thundering so hard we were scared we were going  get shocked. So we waited growl, whent my tummy.‚ÄùI‚Äòm hungry‚Äù so me and my grandmother asked can we still get our subs made because we have light. The manger said ‚Äúokay‚Äù. She told the worker to get back to work. Twenty min later the manger started passing out subs chips, soda, and cookies it was eight pm. We all ate drank I felt asleep on a booth seat. We all woke up the next morning sun shing lights on. So we all walked out to our cars smelling like break & meat. That was the best patient day of my life, a night I will always remember.
720	18641	7	3	I ride a beautiful paint horse named Patches, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. Patches is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so Patches has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset Patches she is patient most of the time, only flicking her ears back. I try my best and so does Patches, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so Patches has to put up with me. After Patches and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get Patches a treat. Patches watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat, her head hanging over the stall door. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. Patches then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while.
721	18642	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when we went to @LOCATION2. It was a long @NUM1 hour flight with a two hour layover in @LOCATION1. It was really hard for me to be patient because I was so excited and I really wanted to go to @LOCATION2. In the layover, to pass the time, I listend to my ipod and used my macbook pro to get on face book to talk to my friends. It really helped me be patient because it took my mind of thinking about @LOCATION2 and we were in @LOCATION2 in know time, and when we arrived my patientís paid of because I got to swim on beautiful beaches and party I @LOCATION2 for @DATE1 break @DATE2. It was a fantastic trip, and that is my story about a time I was patient.
722	18643	7	3	There was @NUM1 girls and there mom was gay and she took them to a motel for the middle childs b-day. It was all good units the moms girlfried cathy and my mom @CAPS1 went out to go get presents for @CAPS2 so it was just the ddest @CAPS3 middle @CAPS2 baby meme. Well they left and left @CAPS4 and the girls at the motel. They came back @NUM2 hours later. So then @CAPS1 was walking back to get us and I notice she wasnt in the van so I start crying when she told one that cahty got took to jail and we had no money, no was, we didn't now anyone in that town so we had to go to this gas station and me and my sister were siting on the curb and my mom went across the street buse the pay phone. We had to wait patiently in the cold winter, feeling very alone. Untill @NUM3 really nice ladies saw us sitting on the cold ground and big us up and that show I moved to bangor from southhaven, which was a big change for our family.
723	18644	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting in the hospital. One time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing, we were all very worried. When we got to the hospital we couldnít go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, and uncle were just sitting in the waiting room, waiting very patiently and quietly. When the next day came we still couldnít see her which was sad and scary for everyone. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital my mom was very upset because we couldnít see her at all. Finally, the doctor came out and said we can see her. When we got into the room she was sitting up and smiling, which made us feel better. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see you. My granny scud the doctor said it wasnít a really big deal, just a fainting spell. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left but my mom stayed. In conclusion I told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didnít and we stayed very calm, which was the right thing to do. This is the time I was patient.
724	18645	7	3	Being patient is a good thing, and it is something I am learning. Sometimes impatient @CAPS1 and sometimes im not, but I know its better to be patient. My cousin is very patient so when I tell her to wait and be patient she will wait as long as she want without complaining. My other causins tell me to be patient and I will just be waiting for a while and I ask then hurry up and they tell me to learn to be patient, that good things take time. My cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient and we tRied different ways to practice waiting. So now I can stay longer being patient, which is a good skill to have in life.
725	18646	7	3	"I was in class waiting for lunch, and I new that it would come soon. The time was almost here, but I was still waiting for the first class to yet over. Which was math. Personally I didn't like math all that much so unfortunately l had to wait, which felt like forever. @NUM1 more minutes and l was home free. The time had come and l was happy. @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 your folder away"" @CAPS2! I @CAPS1 it away faster than I can say supercal fraja list expeal & docinus, my heart racing. So then in his voice he said ""You @MONTH1 go to lunch"" I hurried and I was going to be the first one there I almost thought I wasn't patient enough but l was. I booked it there home free, feeling victorious. When l relized a figure in front of me. ""no"" l said. I was defeated by a girl! I was devastaded that is my story and I'm stick to it, a lesson in patience and speed."
726	18647	7	3	When most people think of patience they think of waiting. But that’s only half of it. Patience is waiting without complaining, like when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five hour drive. I know that doesn’t seem like a lot but I @CAPS1 corridor. I just @CAPS1 them pure and simple. But me and my brother didn’t complain, mainly because the night before our mom said if we complained we’d sit with her in the hotel room the whole time. Isn’t that scary? So we finally got there. The week was fun, we ate good food, played sweet games and went to an awesome museum. But on the ride back it was another trial of patience, even more so because we got in an accident. The car was damaged, and we had to wait for a tow truck and a new ride, all without a single word of complaint from either of us. It was a true test of our ability to endure delays calmly, and we passed.
727	18648	7	3	In @DATE1 my dad had a business trip in @CAPS1 dinsney land. We got to the park and rode some rides. My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did. After a while I saw something cool, space @CAPS2. I got in line and I saw a sign, @NUM1 hours until lift off! My mom was shocked so we left. I was so disappointed. We came back the next day and the wait was @NUM2 hours. We got in line and waited and waited and waited. After @NUM3 minutes I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave but the line was too big to get out. After hours that seemed like years we got to the front, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom got out of line and so did my sister, but I stayed. I waited all by myself for @NUM4 minutes when I got on the coaster! It was fun, and I got a fastpass for @NUM5 other rides! In the end my patience paid off, and I felt proud for sticking it out alone to experience the thrilling ride and the rewards that followed.
728	18649	7	3	It was late @DATE1 when my @CAPS1 is and I was going to @CAPS2 point for my @CAPS1. So we take forever to drive there just sitting in the back seat all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally get there wasting all my patience on being in the car after we get in we go on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5 wait to ride a @NUM1 minute ride it is worth it but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I'm waiting then we get off the ride then we go on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there were at least 1-@NUM1 hours long. Except one ride the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowd came in. So it was only @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on the ride and at the top of the hill it was probably a @CAPS5 line. So we really lucked out on that one. But @CAPS8 the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and that was all the patience left so we were in line to leave the park for another @CAPS5 and a half so we waited and waited and finally it moved and once we got through the park and out of it the road we had to take was closed because of a car accident so we had to take this huge detour that added a @CAPS5 to our time because of traffic taking that way and @CAPS8 the time we got to our hotel I didn’t have one drop of patience left I felt like I was going to blow up but I didn’t I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patience, and I learned that patience is truly tested at the end of a very long day.
729	18650	7	3	A time when I was patient, was when I went to @CAPS1 point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. We rode some rides, then @CAPS6 sister said “can we ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again?” I replied “sure,” even though it was our fifth time riding the ride. @CAPS6 sister and I went and stood in line for the ride. I said “we should ride front row.” @CAPS4 said “we should.” @CAPS5 we went to the front row and the line was packed. @CAPS5 we waited twenty minutes or @CAPS5 when someone threw up on another cart. The employees had to clean up the barf, which took another twenty minutes. @CAPS5 we kept waiting and waiting until they let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed “who would barf on a ride like @CAPS7,” @CAPS6 dad replied “I don’t know.” @CAPS7 day is a day that I remember @CAPS6 patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasn’t worth the wait. What was worth the wait is seeing the smile on @CAPS6 sister’s face and her laughing, which made the entire long, tedious wait completely worthwhile in the end.
730	18651	7	3	I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many experiences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something she texts me saying, “@CAPS1!” or, “@CAPS2 onnn!” @CAPS3 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunately, @PERSON1 wasn’t mad! She was understanding and said that it was ok. Usually, she would say something like, “@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?” @CAPS5 time she didn’t say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had experiences with many patient people and @CAPS5 experience turned out to be fun, proving that patience can truly make any situation better for everyone involved.
731	18652	7	3	"I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you don’t want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Specially at cedar point you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force so I hope the thing would turn off. But that morning I was going to cedar point and I couldn’t wait. So I got up, took a shower, and ate breakfast which was great my mom made blueberry muffins.  I got all of my clothes packed a week early because I was so excited. I put my clothes in the car and then my brother, sister, mom, and dad got in so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasn’t so great because it was three hours long but we had a tv in our car so it didn’t take as long as it normally does because we were occupied so it is like a shorter car ride for my brother sister and I. When we got into the hotel it was awesome because it was like fifteen stories high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our room on the tenth floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wanted to buy the furry things but she couldn’t. My mom woke us up saying, ""Come on, the rides open in about thirty minutes, we got to be there."" So I raced up out of bed running around like I got fire on my butt trying to find my clothes. I found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the other side of the bed. By the time we were all up, dressed, and showered, the rides had been going on for an hour so we walked over to the gate and got in line for one ride called Millennium Force. The sign said four hours wait and also said, ""Sorry, the ride is now just getting started because of difficulties with the seatbelts and other technical difficulties, sorry."" So my mom said, ""Wait here, this ride is really fun."" So we waited and waited; I had no patience any more. She said she would buy me a hot dog after this, so I did wait, and the ride was a blast after waiting for hours at the park. It was fun but we had to go tomorrow. And I got my hot dog. That was my story of being patient at cedar point when all you want to do is have fun. Sometimes you got to be patient to get what you want."
732	18653	7	3	One hot summer day my family and I went to Cedar Point. There was a new ride open called Shoot the Rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was, it said one hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about ninety degrees outside, and we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way through the line when my nerves kicked in; I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About forty-five minutes later we were ten people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another half hour. As time passed we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but I’m glad I didn’t chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regretted the experience.
733	18654	7	3	"One time I had to be really patient when my grandma said there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing showed up for days. Then I started getting impatient. My grandma said, ""Just keep waiting, it will come soon."" So I did what my grandma said and the next day a big package finally came. I was so happy it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and me some new sneakers. Also we all got MP3 players. I was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth the long wait."
734	18655	7	3	"One day when I was in third grade, my mom was driving me to school and she said, ""When I pick you up today I have a surprise for you at home."" That whole day I had to be patient but I couldn’t; I just had to get home to see what it was. I could have pretended I was sick and went home but I decided to just calm down and be patient. I told myself the school day will be over soon. At three o'clock I left school and my mom picked me up. I told her I was so excited to see what she had for me but I told her I was patient the whole school day! Finally we got home and she told me to go to my room. I said okay. When I got inside I saw a little, cute, black puppy. I was so happy I got a dog! I said, ""Thank you mom, thank you so much dad!"" I ended up naming her Chloe."
735	18656	7	3	"Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go through it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldn’t wait to get to Florida. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait two hours until the plane left and we’d be on our way. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into the speakers, ""I’m very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we cannot proceed until it clears up."" Oh no! ""How long will it take?"" asked my mom. ""About five hours,"" she said. It’s a good thing we brought our DVD player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, we played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we were very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five Disney World pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter how hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family was."
736	18657	7	3	"Patience is a great thing. It means to be understanding and calm. Sometimes people can take difficulties and pain and still stay calm. Any time when your brother or sister annoys you, you're still patient and never lash back. ""Wake up already!!"" my brother shouted. ""I’m awake!"" I hollered. I took in a huge gulp of air and let it out with a sigh. ""I’m so bored!"" my brother shouted in my face, ""can we go walking?"" I was counting past ten in my mind and then finally spoke, ""Fine."" I got my coat off the rack followed by my little brother. We walked outside right when we saw my mom coming to give me a chore. ""You’ll have to cut the grass today and rake the leaves,"" Mom said calmly, ""after you walk your little brother."" ""Okay,"" I said, though I was completely furious on the inside. I tried to keep calm, but that didn’t last long. ""Hey there!"" my brother's friend said cheerfully, ""can you come over and play?"" he asked him. My brother looked up at me and I was closing my eyes, barely holding on. ""I guess,"" I stammered, walking back home. I grabbed the lawn mower and right when I was about to turn it on—""Stop, get inside and start your homework. . . Then, you can go out!"" ""One two. . . Three..."" I counted silently. I walked with a fake grin on my face. ""On the other hand... go take out the trash!"" ""One hundred seventy-five...!"" I kept counting. I ran downstairs, grabbed the trash, and walked to the trash can. As I dropped the garbage inside I tried to put myself in a happy place—Crash! I sped inside to gaze at what had happened; it turned out my sister broke my Xbox on the tiles because she wanted to play. If I get passed one hundred in counting in my brain I’m going to explode! I thought. I held my little sister and gave her to my mom. ""She broke my Xbox!"" I repeated. ""Don't worry, your dad will fix it,"" Mom said calmly. ""Now go get your brother."" ""Okay..."" I speed-walked down to my brother's friend's house and told him I had to get my brother. ""Let's go!"" I shouted, ""your brother is here to get you."" ""Coming!"" he yelled. I urged myself to stay silent and patient and I managed to. We walked back home and I threw myself on my bed. ""What a boring day!"" I spoke to myself. ""I don’t think I’m ever going to be this patient in my life again!!"" And I smacked my head into the pillow and said, ""Good night everyone!"" and went to bed. Wow! What a day! Patience means to be understanding and calm. Patience is great. I tried and learned a powerful lesson, always try. My life is way better now because I try to stay patient and never hit my brother or sister even though they get me so mad sometimes. The world would be better if everyone would just stay patient; people have to try to succeed, it’s a very, very famous phrase."
737	18658	7	3	"It’s like when you're waiting in a long line; that’s patience. Or like when you keep on raising your hand and the teacher keeps on saying, ""Do your work,"" and you do it again, so she will say, if you do that again you will go to the choiceroom. That’s when a teacher loses her patience because she has asked you repeatedly to stop. It shows that everyone has a limit, even those who are supposed to be calm. Staying patient in frustrating situations is a challenge for everyone, but it is an important quality to practice every day."
738	18659	7	3	I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it was the first week of football. We went down to Subway before the game and got a sub. I was the first one in line but then I was followed by other people; only one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next and I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana peppers, cucumbers, and great fresh spinach. I learned something in that line: being patient really pays off and by the time I sat back, it had been over thirty minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first game; we played hard and we tied it, though, but that was still a great day! The experience taught me that good things come to those who wait calmly.
739	18660	7	3	"The time I was patient... One after school I was walking home with my friends from school. Being me, I wanted something to eat so I told my friends to come into Burger King's restaurant (it’s a fast food restaurant.) After we walk in to Burger King, the place is crowded so I waited in line. After about five minutes my friends said, ""Come on man let’s go."" So I say, ""I’ll meet you guys outside."" ""Alright,"" they said. About ten minutes later it was my turn to order and I ordered a double stack and some fries and I got a free milkshake for my patience. She asked what kind did I want; I said strawberry and I didn’t have to pay for it, it was totally free. I went outside and I told my friends I got this for free and then they said, ""Ooooooooh,"" that’s when we went home, proving that patience can have its own sweet rewards."
740	18661	7	3	About three weeks ago I ordered a book series online, I had to be very patient so it wouldn’t feel like a year of waiting. This book series was not like any other book series; these books are my favorite, they’re called the Harry Potter series. I have read the series many times and I am still reading them. But, I had to wait to get them. I was trying to be patient, but it was hard. The mailing date said it would arrive in less than one hour, but I had to wait for five days before it came. When I finally forgot about them, they arrived! Being patient is a good quality people can have. So if you are patient you will probably get what you want, and the waiting makes the reward even better in the end.
741	18662	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I took my first state test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy either, requiring careful thought for each answer. I finished it with about one and a half hours left in the testing period. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent, staring at the clock on the wall. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a ten year old, imagine ninety minutes! At first I was fidgeting with my pencil, then my neck started to hurt from holding the same position, so I layed my head down on the cool desk. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still, listening to the quiet sounds of the room. Soon enough the time flew by and the English Language Arts assessment was over for the day. I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those ninety minutes, proving I could handle the challenge.
742	18663	7	3	Hi my name is Alex and I’m going to tell you a story about how one time I was patient. I remember when I was patient. It was Christmas day. There was tons and tons of presents under the tree, wrapped in colorful paper and shiny bows. There was tiny ones all the way to huge ones. But I couldn’t even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up, and the rule was we had to wait for everyone. I wanted to go into my mom’s and dad’s room and wake them up right away. But no, not without some breakfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so I can open my presents. I carefully set the tray with toast and juice, trying not to spill anything. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my presents, and the wait made it even more special.
743	18664	7	3	"Patience is when you are tolerant and understanding, able to wait calmly for an outcome. Many people don't have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but here’s a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon. The sun was shining like there’s no tomorrow. Too bad I couldn’t play outside. I was too busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big football event with my brother. It could give me bragging rights I figured I needed some hope and patience. ""Steelers,"" my brother yelled all happy and in my face. ""Ha ha loser, lions are winning and steelers are loosing,"" he added. ""Don't get too happy, there’s still plenty of time left,"" I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I’d lose, but taking deep breaths in and out, I was very patient. The clock was winding down. It was the beginning of the fourth quarter. The score was 21 to 17, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the quarterback for the steelers made an awesome pass and touchdown I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, ""who is the loser now, huh?"" Wow all it took was patience, and hope I told myself. Patience can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little competitive but if you just wait and tolerate what’s happening around you, you’ll end up getting rewarded in the end!"
744	18666	7	3	I guess you could say that patience is one of my best talents. I go through many things that involve patience and I live through it without a word. Everyone knows that the worst place to be patient in is church service on Sunday. You are up, then you kneel down, then you stand, then you sit, and it goes on forever. It seems to last for hours. But I know that there are a lot of kids that aren't as patient as me, some of them have all kinds of other feelings that make them impatient while others are just built that way. I know people who are like that and really energetic, they just can't sit still. I know that those people struggle in school and I feel bad for them. There are times that I start to feel impatient when there are other people around me that are impatient. The worst is I get impatient with them and I get frustrated because no matter how many times I tell them to stop tapping their pencil or to stop complaining, they just don't stop. I guess what I'm saying is that everybody's different; some people are quiet and patient, but some people are athletic while others are academic. It is no different with patience, as we all have our own strengths.
745	18667	7	3	There was a fish named Finn. Finn lived around the Sharpfin archipelago, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly due to the strong, unpredictable currents. Luckily, Finn was the legendary coelacanth, a fish that does is float slowly and wait. Yesterday, Finn caught two small fish and gave them to his wife. Today all of the fish are in the desert, a barren area of sand which Finn absolutely despises. Using his patience, Finn waits for something to jump out from the sand. Suddenly, Finn sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny, a hook hidden just beneath. It was too far away to grab, though. Finn went home to his wife empty-handed. The next day, Finn went to the current and saw the floating meat again, drifting temptingly. Finn lunged for it and started chewing when something sharp stabbed him in the mouth. Finn started pulling fiercely when he heard a loud snap. When Finn tugged again he fell into the current, the line finally breaking. Finn was finally free! Finn also realized the current felt pretty nice, carrying him along. Finn ate a couple of small fish and slept. When Finn woke up, he saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins, a predator out of water. Finn couldn't breathe and he was in a net. Finn snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and died in the struggle.
746	18668	7	3	In sports you always have to be patient. Like if you're not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you, you must maintain your composure. If you are patient and keep working hard, sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient throughout his entire basketball career. At @PERSON2 High, where he went to school, he wasn’t the biggest, fastest, or strongest player, and he wasn't even considered the best, but he was exceptionally patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school, he tried out for the varsity team, but unfortunately, he didn’t make it. He was deeply upset with himself and the coaches because he truly felt he should have made the team. His mom went to him and told him firmly not to give up. Unlike most kids, @PERSON1 didn’t quit or tell himself that he wasn’t good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard on his game every single day. All that work eventually paid off because the very next year he successfully made the team. He went on to attend @LOCATION1 for college. There, he won a championship with a memorable game-winning shot. He then went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. At that time, the @CAPS3's were one of the worst teams in the entire @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple of years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple of seasons, @PERSON1 stayed calm and focused, and he went on to win five more championships after that. In his last championship run, @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew his patience would be tested once again. They made it to the finals, but the @CAPS2 were getting tired. They went down in the series @NUM1, facing elimination. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting, refusing to give up. Finally, the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some incredibly tough situations throughout his career, but he always stayed patient and ultimately played like an all-star, proving the value of perseverance.
747	18669	7	3	The day I was patient was at camp, and I was on the high ropes course. The person in front of me was moving very slowly, so I had to be patient and wait my turn. When I finally got up and went through the first obstacle, I found he was waiting on the next platform, blocking the way. I had to wait patiently again until the camp counselors took him down safely. Then I finally got to go out on the course, but when I got halfway through the obstacle, the instructors told me I had to be patient once more and wait until all the people got off the platform ahead. It took a couple of minutes of standing still, holding onto the ropes, but then I finally got to go and complete the course. That was the day I truly learned what it meant to have to be patient, a lesson I will remember.
748	18670	7	3	My mom is a very patient woman. She shows it every day by helping my brother, @PERSON1, with his homework. @PERSON1 hates everything about doing his homework after school. He hates doing his math problems, he dislikes the required reading, but most of all, he absolutely hates spelling. When my mom is helping him with all three of those subjects, she shows incredible patience because since he hates all of those homework assignments, he doesn’t always do them without throwing a fit. When he does throw a fit, she is very patient with him, speaking calmly and working on the assignments with him step by step until he is completely done. That is how my mom shows her patience, turning a frustrating task into a calm learning experience.
749	18671	7	3	Waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life; I love the way a song can make you feel, and I love how walking a line on the @ORGANIZATION1 can change your entire day. As a young musician, all I can ever think about is music. I had reached my @NUM1 instrument, which was the @CAPS1, and I also play the @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION1. The only instrument my family owns that I couldn't play is the bass. So when my @ORGANIZATION2 broke, I took Mr. Groth up on his need for a @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4 band. I studied my butt off learning the art of the bass @ORGANIZATION1, reading the clef, and learning all the notes. I was waiting for my skills and ranking to increase, and through diligent memorization, I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better, and it seemed each week I improved more and more. I had easily fallen in love with the deep sounds it made, and I found I loved it way more than the @ORGANIZATION2. Sure, it will take time to become a pro, but I have learned that the journey is worth the patience it requires.
750	18672	7	3	When I first saw my puppy, @CAPS3, we were at @ORGANIZATION2. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had brought over some dogs to be rescued. As @CAPS3 saw all six dogs, the second one I saw I just knew he was going to be mine. So @CAPS3 got him out, and the lady said that he’s scared and he gets carsick, but I didn’t care because he was my immediate favorite. @CAPS3 said she wanted him, so she told us to go to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and tell them @CAPS3 wanted @CAPS4. So @CAPS3 raced to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and on the way there, @CAPS3 thought of potential names. My dad came up with the name @CAPS6, and @CAPS3 liked it, so that was his name. I had to wait a whole, long week before I could finally take him home, but as long as I got my puppy, I was fine. @CAPS3 got him a toy, and when @CAPS3 went back to see him, I had it with me every night, knowing I was closer and closer to getting him. The day finally came. @CAPS3 told my brother we were going fishing since he didn’t know we were getting a dog. But once we were there, I ran inside to go see him. @CAPS3 took him home, and he was afraid of everything, even leaves outside. But @CAPS7, he now loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell @CAPS6 it's bed time, and I sleep with my wonderful @ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough, patience is always the key to achieving it.
751	18674	7	3	My dad has a girlfriend named @PERSON1. She has two kids, one that’s seven years old, and one that is four years old. The oldest one is @PERSON2, @CAPS1 loves to skateboard. The youngest one is @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 is kind of a spaz and if you jumped out of an airplane, @CAPS1 would too, always eager to copy any daring action. This one day @PERSON2 and I were going to go skateboarding at a park, @PERSON3 wanted to come but @CAPS1 didn’t even know how to ride a skateboard. @PERSON2 went over to the park and when we got there, @CAPS1 realized @CAPS1 didn’t have his skateboard. I had to let him use my skateboard for the entire time. I didn’t have a problem with him using it, it’s just that I didn’t get to use it myself, so I just sat and watched them skate.
752	18675	7	3	I believe that patience means that you are understanding and tolerant and that a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. This story is about the time I was patient with my little brother. @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1. Five more minutes I muttered after about fifteen more steps from the alarm clock. I jumped out of bed remembering that I was babysitting my little brother that entire day. I take the crispy toast from the toaster. I thought to myself, as I tried to swallow the rock hard breakfast on my plates. I quickly take a shower and get dressed into jeans and a t-shirt. At the time @PERSON1 was about two years old and could walk. He was mischievous, and it was hard for anyone to be patient with him because of all the disasters that he has created. But he was so cute that it was extremely hard to stay mad at him. When I heard the sound of a car entering our driveway, I knew my mom had left. When @CAPS3 comes in the house I went up to his room where he sat waiting for someone to get him out. I dressed him in a clean and adorable baby outfit. I brought him to the kitchen and made cereal for him, which was much softer than my usual food. Crunch crunch went the colorful cereal. Later, as we played outside, we had a good time. After the game, we played with cars for a while and then it was dinner. We had more fun and before we knew it, it was night time. I sat him in the bath and then went to go get his pajamas. When I came back the whole bathroom was wet with warm bath water. When I finally got him dried and dressed, @CAPS3 was not in the tub. I sighed as I wiped up the water, and then I helped him get into bed for the night.
753	18676	7	3	I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1 their was a @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @LOCATION1 was it went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready @NUM3 after @NUM4 and the line didn’t even move. I was so mad. Every @NUM5 minutes the line would scoot up a little bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. @CAPS2 was there when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me an airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2 was all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me a good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys we were next in line. We went up to the front. I ask him what I wanted and he said “you’ll shoot your eye out, kid.” @CAPS2 was when I got mad because I had to be so patient for that. That is the last time I’m going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall.
754	18677	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my football game and the defence was in and I was waiting to go back in. Then finally my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball and the offense including me ran in on the field, and then they had me run it up the middle and I scored and then we passed it for the two point conversion and it came to me but it was high and I tipped it then it came right down in my hands and I got it but then I had to wait again because the defence went back in but then it was half time. I am the kick returner and we got the ball as I got the kick and returned it all the way for a touchdown and it was really cool because my team was bleeding and I broke a lot of tackles. Then it was the @DATE1 and all the other players were doing their jobs. They were kneeling it and finally my teammate swatted the pass and on one play the my team jumped on it and we had the ball then our full back got a pass and got the game winning touch down and that's a time when I had to be patient for my chance to help the team succeed.
755	18678	7	3	The definition of patience is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you don’t ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patience is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with a whopping overload of stuff in their kart, & you don’t get mad at the person that is called patience. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don’t get mad and you keep trying to teach them that's patience. Another example of patience is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don’t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and doesn’t pay you any mind and you still try to teach or show them something that’s a sign of patience. Sometimes patience is important because, if you maybe want to have a job as a therapist you need a lot of patience. Those are some definitions and examples of what it means to have patience in different situations.
756	18680	7	3	Patience. What is patience? Patience is waiting for something calmly, without becoming annoyed or anxious. Its waiting for the right time to propose, or ask her on a date, understanding that rushing can spoil the moment. Life is going to be hard unless you're patient, as many worthwhile things require time and perseverance. You need to be patient when getting a job, carefully preparing for interviews and waiting for responses without giving up hope. Cultivating this virtue can lead to greater success and peace in all aspects of life.
757	18681	7	3	This is a writing piece on how I had to be patient to get a phenomenal bowl of ice cream. My grandparents had just picked my brother and I up from our house to go get ice cream at Cold Stone. I had never gone to Cold Stone before, but my friends said it was really good. So I had asked my grandparents if we could go, and I was amped. When we arrived at our destination the line was huge, winding out the door. It was shaped like a snake, and the sign said “fifteen minutes wait.” I was disappointed and was about to leave when I saw it: the peanut butter cup perfection. It was staring me right in my face, so I talked to my grandparents and said we could stay. When we finally got to the front of the line I ordered the peanut butter ice cream. It was time to send my taste buds on vacation, and it was fantastic. It was so smooth and creamy. I was thinking to myself how I was glad that I was patient enough to enjoy that amazing dessert. That was the time I had to be patient to go get a phenomenal ice cream bowl.
758	18682	7	3	Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant of delays or problems. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining, maintaining a calm demeanor. There was a time when I was patient at a theme park. Being patient is difficult to do, but I did it before. “This line isn’t even moving,” my brother said, obviously not being patient himself. He then said, “Hello, man, can you walk any slower?” to the person in front of us. A nice man said in a kind, friendly voice, “I can if you want me to.” My brother replied, “Are you that dumb? I wasn’t for real. I might cut you just because of your stupidity.” He was only a year older than me and he thinks he’s all big and can do anything he wants. The man said, “Little man, you can’t cut me, I was waiting in line forever.” While my brother was making enemies, I was waiting patiently in line even though it wasn't really moving; inside I wanted to shout, but unlike some people I have patience and can wait. After my brother cut that man and didn’t get punished, he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were very mad at him, but not one did anything besides say, “Hey, don’t cut me.” That didn’t really help until he cut the wrong person, a young, pretty lady with beautiful blue eyes and pretty blond hair named Sarah. She said, “Call the police, this young boy just cut me and everyone else.” While I was waiting there patiently, my brother got kicked out of the whole park. When it was finally my turn, I got on the roller coaster. It was the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard, but it can be rewarding. I also learned that to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerance. Now, I know you get the best results when you're patient, and the worst when you're not.
759	18683	7	3	A kid in my school, Michael, has had a crush on my best friend Mycaela for who knows how long. He has asked her about fifty times, and each time she has kindly turned him down. She likes him as a friend but nothing more, a point she has made clear on numerous occasions. She has dated many guys since Michael first asked her out. Mycaela can be a little boy-obsessed; in fact, she is now dating a boy who I asked out just two days ago, but sorry, that is off topic. Anyway, Michael is always very patient, hoping Mycaela will come around someday. It’s been almost two years with him quietly admiring her from a distance, and she still hasn’t come around. I just think that Michael is very patient and he is a great kid for handling his feelings with such persistent grace and respect.
760	18684	7	3	One time I was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least three hours. We were in the car on our way to my aunt's house at the lake. I was watching my dog sleep on my lap for the first hour, which was somewhat peaceful. The second hour I was sleeping myself, trying to pass the time. The third hour I was watching a movie on my tablet, and by this time I had to go to the bathroom really bad. Then by the last hour and a half I was legitimately tearing up because I had to go so badly. By the time my mom finally got off the phone, we were already at my aunt’s house. I legitimately ran inside, dashed into the bathroom, and then I was finally fine, relieved that my patience, though severely tested, had ultimately paid off.
761	18685	7	3	I'm @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids living in the home, which created a lot of uncertainty. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a suitable home to move to, a process that felt endless. Secondly I wasnít told when I could go home to my real mom, which was incredibly difficult. I had to wait till everything was over and the decisions were finally made. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed my bags immediately and waited with a nervous heart. I had to have patience with everyone involved in the process. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to actually get home, a delay that tested my spirit, and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack; to this day I am still unpacking some boxes. Being a foster kid takes a lot of patience, more than most people can imagine. I learned that through all the waiting and the silence.
762	18686	7	3	There was a new restaurant opening in town! He really wanted to go, so his family decided to check it out. It had opened just @NUM1 minutes ago. They didnít think there was going to be a line at all. They got there and they didnít see any cars in the drive thru, which seemed like a good sign. They went through the drive through, which started at the back of the restaurant and wrapped around the building. Then they saw about @NUM2 cars ahead of them. He was really mad at the sight. They were about to leave and then there were @NUM3 cars behind them, blocking them in, so they stayed in line. Since it was a new restraunt, everyone was picking their food very slowely, unsure of the menu. They where also making the food very slowely in the kitchen. Then people started yelling, ì@CAPS1 up,î they where also honking their horns loudly, but he was the only one who wasnít honking his horn. They where waiting for @NUM2 minutes and @NUM1 of those had gone completely @CAPS3. He was starving and he still was being very patient, clutching his stomach. He usually is not a patient person at all. He was very excited to eat at the new restraunt he had heard so much about. When it was finally his turn the cashier said, ì@CAPS2 you for being very patient and not causing a scene.î @CAPS3 the time they finally got their food it had taken @NUM6 full hour. The food wasnít even good, which was the biggest disappointment! He showed a lot of patience that day, more than he knew he had. He didnít honk his car horn and he wasnít yelling at anyone. He had stayed in the car for @NUM6 hour and he was starving by the end. It is a great thing to have patience, even when the reward is not what you hoped for.
763	18688	7	3	This is a story about patience, pateince is when someone gives you a older or specific job to do, and you do it without a fuss. Then you do the job or order with no @CAPS1 askd, even if you dont wont to do it or find it difficult. Last week my mom told me to cleam the living room, a task that seemed huge with all the toys and clutter. Even know it was hard and felt overwhelming, I still did not complain or refuse. Even know I did not want to do it and thought it was unfair, I understood it was my responsibility to help out.
764	18689	7	3	Patience is a very important virtue that everyone should try to cultivate. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 key aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience, no one will want to be your friend for very long. You have to have patience with your friends when they are late or make mistakes, or they will not be your friends. I know this from personal experience with my own friendships. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience and persevere. Whether is waiting for the bus in the rain or waiting for a response from a job interview you really want, itíll always matter to keep calm. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have for a happy and successful life.
765	18690	7	3	I believe patience is important for many reasons that affect our daily lives. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything without getting upset or angry. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line at a store or a movie theater. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday in small ways. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket for a concert or waiting to get gas for your car, you have to wait your turn to get it without pushing ahead. Lastly patience is important because without patience you wouldn't be able to read a long book or study for a test. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and get into, and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it if you were impatient. That's exactly why l believe patience is important for getting through many of life's common tasks.
766	18691	7	3	One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there, enjoying the lively atmosphere and the bright lights. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had, which made me feel incredibly lucky. I thought to myself “nothing will get in my way,” well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival I saw this new ride, a towering structure that spun people around at high speed. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got in front of me. That’s when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only fifteen minutes. People kept on going ahead of me, cutting into the line without a second glance. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark, my frustration boiling over. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me, and that losing my temper would not help. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything, simply stepping onto the ride platform. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I was so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasn’t so bad in the end. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought they were gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they thought I was gonna say something.
767	18693	7	3	Every day I must be patient in difficult things. I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weekend my brother plays in a football league and it can be wearing. I have to wait almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me watch the entire game. My favorite sport is baseball and since I am a first baseman and an outfielder, I have to wait for the ball to come to me so that I can help the team. The game involves a lot of waiting for action. I also have to be patient during the school day because it is a long one and I must wait until people are done with their work. As you can see, I am very patient and have to be in many situations, which is a necessary part of my daily life.
768	18694	7	3	Freezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the charity walk to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talked with themselves, leaving me and my friend Sarah. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and she hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, Max, tugs on his leash and Sarah, being the one holding the leash, stumbles sideways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tenth time. “No, I got it!” she says happily. I was cold, bored, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, Max was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was no easy task. “Really!” Sarah says lightly, “I got it!” Max pulls her again and Sarah falls into me. I catch her, and she mumbles a sorry. I had my doubts, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb,” I say shoving them into my pockets. “True, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said,” Sarah smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the speaker, “All walkers. Let’s get moving!” I glare at Sarah and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” She pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”
769	18695	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to babysit my little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I couldn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, but I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I would gently rock him or try to offer him a bottle. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important for anyone caring for a child. I am proud of myself for being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not losing my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else.
770	18696	7	3	"Ugh, what is taking the gym teacher so long? John whined. ""It's been hours."" ""It's only been ten minutes."" Mike said. ""Seriously, it has felt like its been a couple of hours."" John said. ""Well, you just have to have a little patience."" the coach explained. ""Fine,"" John said. ""While you sit here and have your so-called patience I'll be putting my bag on the stage."" Then John got up and everybody tried to tell him to sit down but all he did was ignore them. ""Come on man just sit down and have patience,"" Mike said. ""No, I've been waiting too long I'm bored I'm tired and my feet hurt!"" John yelled as he was walking behind the stage. ""You're gonna get in trouble."" Mike said, looking down. ""What was all that yelling?"" yelled the gym teacher with an angry face. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw John behind stage and said ""You all could have played basketball but John messed it up for everybody."" So nobody played because John didn't have any patience. Today I hope he'll have a little more patience hopefully."
771	18697	7	3	I woke up early before school started, getting ready for the day. I grabbed all my stuff and walked out the door. When I got to school I started hanging out with my friends and was having a good day so far. At around @NUM1, the @NUM2 hour is over and we go to lunch. I wasn’t hungry and I wanted to go with my friend @CAPS1, but she wanted to eat, so I waited patiently for her and we went outside afterwards. When we go outside we like to do back walkovers, handstands, backbends, front handsprings, cartwheels and stuff like that. After the bell rang in @NUM3 hour it was recourse; I wasn’t feeling good, I was hungry. I just wanted to go home and grab something to eat but we still had to wait till recourse was over, then we had to ride the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home I didn’t feel good, my dad asked me whats the matter and I told him I was hungry. It was around @NUM4 and he said we have to wait until mom gets home; my mom gets home at @TIME1. I had to wait and be patient for @NUM5 hours, and I realized its ok to wait because it was a delicious dinner. If I would have ate something else before dinner I probably would not have eaten any of my dinner, and that would have been a shame. And that was a story with @NUM6 examples of me having to be patient, which taught me a valuable lesson about self-control.
772	18698	7	3	There haven’t been many times where I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 made me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t allowed to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first, sitting there quietly, but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do and made the time pass more quickly. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at Cedar Point. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride. We talked and played games on our phones, and it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you finally ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that, proving to myself that I can manage the feeling.
773	18700	7	3	Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go a friend's house. Savannah's dad is a firefighter and he had to put out a fire and could not pick me up until the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I hadn't seen Savannah in @NUM1 months. I spent the day thinking about all the fun we would have when we finally saw each other, trying to keep my spirits up. That day I learned patience is a way of life people have to live with and this is the time I had to live with it, understanding that sometimes good things are worth the wait.
774	18701	7	3	There I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on a @DATE1 standing in the blazing sun. I could feel the sweat drip off my face. I looked ahead; there was at least two hours left for standing in line for the roller coaster, The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @CAPS7 was silent because they were getting irritable. All of a sudden this guy screamed, “@CAPS6 up!” @CAPS7 in line started screaming at each other except for me. I didn’t want to yell because it would get @CAPS7 worked even more. An hour later everybody chilled out. Then I looked ahead. @CAPS10 were almost to the front. I wiped my face and smiled. Then I said, “@CAPS8 hoo!” @CAPS7 looked at me like I was from a different planet. My mom asked, “what?” I replied, “@CAPS10’re almost to the front!” Then @CAPS10 were next to go on the ride. When @CAPS10 entered the ride I fastened my seatbelt. Next the ride took off! The breeze felt good against my face as we sped along the tracks. When the ride ended I said, “I knew patience would pay off.” That is the time I had to have patience and learned how rewarding it can be.
775	18702	7	3	It was blistering hot, it had already been an hour in line. “When can we go?” I asked in a moaning voice. My parents replied, “just be patient, we're almost at the front.” @CAPS1, that is what I did. My body was aching from walking around all day, but that wasn’t going to stop me from enjoying all these rides. Ten more minutes had passed and I began to get thirsty. My @CAPS3 and sister wanted to go get a drink with me while my mum held our spot in line. We made it to the booth. “I’ll take water,” I said, feeling relieved. I said thankyou, as I grabbed the ice cold water from his hands. As we all started walking back towards the line, I spotted a bright colorful shirt that said, “@CAPS2.” I couldn’t help but ask, “@CAPS3, can I please get this shirt? We still have to wait a little bit longer in the line if we go back.” “@CAPS4,” he responded, “but let’s hurry up @CAPS1, your mom doesn’t get impatient.” After I got the shirt we walked back in the line. Thank goodness we were the second ones up. “All aboard the mummy ride,” the person controlling the ride explained. We walked on; being patient paid off, because I had a feeling this ride was going to be a blast and it truly was.
776	18703	7	3	Hello, my name is Ethan and this is a story about the time I was patient. Once when I was eight years old my mom said that she would take me to the fair that day. So after lunch we went to the fairgrounds. I wanted to ride the biggest ride there, the giant roller coaster, so we had to wait in line for it. The line was very long so I had to be patient to get on the ride. I did not want to wait in line so half of the time in line I was complaining, but my mom reminded me the line was not that long and I have to be patient. I am glad I was patient because the ride was full of fun. That day I learned that it was good to be patient. I told my mom I will never be impatient again. That was the story of the time I had to be patient at the fair.
777	18704	7	3	Being patient is a good thing to have. Let me tell you about a time I was patient. Once I had a dentist's appointment; we arrived at 9:00 am and my appointment was at 9:30 am. Me and my dad sat and waited until 9:30. It was hurting my patience. I didn't have anything to do. I don't read magazines, and they didn't have a TV or anything. I was really hungry because I didn't have any breakfast. At 9:20 am we were still waiting. I couldn't do it. It was so boring until I remembered I had a Nintendo DS in my pocket. So I took it out and started to play it. Time went past fast. That’s the time I was patient.
778	18705	7	3	Patience is the thing I am mainly going to tell you about, a time when I was patient and how I did stuff to make myself patient. One day my dad and I had to wait in the hospital to get a trip replacement and we had to sit and wait in the waiting room for one hour. I was wondering why we had to wait all the time and come back. Well, the thing kept telling us to wait one more hour. Anyway, I hurt my mouth and then my chest. Two hours later, I touched my chest and looked at it, unsure when I'd get to ride a scooter. Then after that, when we had counted the ceiling tiles for three minutes, I noted that I remembered there were over one hundred tiles. That was a challenge, but I didn't complain about that yet at least. After I counted the ceiling tiles I played a game with my dad; I won and we ate up five minutes of the rest of the time. Then I played my game console. I played Minecraft on the game. It occupied me for a while and then I did it. One more hour and it was time to go home; my dad and I were tired beyond help. I didn't complain once and that is the time I was patient.
779	18706	7	3	Patience is truly the hardest thing and nobody really knows that as well as I do. I find it hard to be patient because I'm on punishment for not doing what I was supposed to do. So I have to be patient and wait it out until it is over. Being patient is what is required for a person to get through it. From my perspective, that is how it is. So while I'm on punishment I am just waiting it out so my time will come, because I can't speed up time and just make it go quicker. But if I could, I would. For now, I have to wait. I'm on punishment for quite a while so I can just be patient. I know beforehand it is hard, but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to do it; patience also helps the situation and can save you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can wait for certain things like; money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, car (transportation), and things of the sort. Because if you rush everything, you won't get it the way you were supposed to, but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be!
780	18707	7	3	As I sit in the waiting room at St. Jude's Children's Hospital, waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to the recovery room, I think to myself what if something went wrong or what if he doesn't make it through the surgery. Then I say to my mom “can we see grandpa now”, she said “Honey, just be patient everything will be just fine if you sit, relax, and for heaven's sakes,” “be patient!” “Okay,” I say to my mom. After an hour passed, I had gotten anxious, so I thought to myself and said to myself, calm and patient, calm and patient. Then this lady comes out to the waiting room and said “the surgery was a little longer than we expected but everything went perfectly fine but he will be staying in the hospital for a week and a half at the most,” which was perfectly fine with me as long as I was going to get out of this boring hospital. And as soon as I said that, my mom said as soon as grandpa gets to the recovery room we will go see him then we will leave!
781	18708	7	3	A time when I had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @LOCATION2. From my house to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 it’s about @NUM1 hrs away. So I had to sit in a car for @NUM1 hours, a journey that felt incredibly long. The only things to do were listen to your ipod and sleep, which I didn’t do either of those things. As you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour had passed it would have felt like @NUM4 if you weren’t doing anything. By that time I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping peacefully in the back seat. I knew I couldn’t do that though, as it would only cause trouble. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people but no one answered, leaving me feeling even more bored. I tried looking out the window at the passing scenery but that made me sleepy. Getting there took too long, and the minutes dragged on. Finally @NUM1 hours passed and we made it to @LOCATION2, a huge relief. This was a time when I truly had patience.
782	18709	7	3	"I was off, I was off to the onto rama to be exact. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 got to see a whole bunch of cool old cars, @CAPS1 also got to see some old ones. Some cars were old and rusty and some are new and state of the art. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 saw a sign that caught our attention. It read come see chip foose! So @CAPS1 went and looked around, hoping to catch a glimpse. ""@CAPS1 found him! I exclaimed. ""@CAPS2"" @CAPS8 brother yelled. ""@CAPS3 is!"" @CAPS4 @CAPS1 went and looked at the end of the line, and it was @CAPS5! So @CAPS1 figured the crowd would die down after a half an hour, but @CAPS1 were very wrong. It was @CAPS5! The line @CAPS1 thought was big was nothing compared to the line now so @CAPS1 had to wait, and wait, and wait. @CAPS8 brother got to the point to where he said he could run a mile if he didn't he was going to explode from boredom. So I had to go walk around with him. I was relived because standing and doing nothing for @NUM1 hours gets boreing real fast. I was getting to the point where I had to get up and walk around or I was going to fall asleep right there. So I went for a walk with him around the venue. @CAPS1 got back and I sat back down, and @CAPS1 waited, and waited, and waited and waited. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 heard a voice shout stop! ""@CAPS6 body behind these people have to go and come back after the break,"" @CAPS7 the security guard. @CAPS1 were the last people allowed in line. The people in front of us was a nerdy couple who had no life, chatting excitedly. @CAPS8 brother started to cry because he didn't get fooses autograph, his face full of disappointment. The kind nerdy couple @CAPS7 ""here have our spot, @CAPS1 have all day and you @CAPS2 like you really wanted this autograph."" @CAPS8 brother replied ""sniff @CAPS9 won't it!!"" @CAPS1 got it after 51/@NUM1 hours of waiting and waiting and waiting and dying from the endless delay. That was the time I had to be patient."
783	18710	7	3	Patients are people who been injured in same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got a shot to help me feel better. On our way out of the hospital I suddenly blacked out and hit my chin hard on the door, which was very painful, so we had to stay their for about an hour while a nurse checked me over. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient, an experience I will not forget.
784	18711	7	3	I was patient when I was at home yesterday watching the movie called @CAPS1. So I waited for a long time until the food was ready and he came with it. I was so interested in the movie that I couldn`t get my eyes of the t.v because the movie was so good and exciting, until when I was really hungry then after that I had a second plate to fill me up. After that second plate I didn`t get to eat the rest of my food as I was full. And I didn`t complain that I was hungry, showing my patience throughout the evening.
785	18712	7	3	Being patience is when someone could be busy and it is just better to be patience while the other person is done. I am going to write about a time when someone I know was being patience. Well on one morning my mom had got out of work when she came I told my mum that I really wanned to go over my friends house. But my mom just keept on saying to wait and so I had to wait so I did, though it was difficult. My mom wasn’t even done still so I told her if I could go walking to my friends house by myself. But she said no and that I had to be patience till she was done with her tasks. My dad was leaving to his work in the afternoon so I had an idea. I told my dad if he could drop me off my friends house and then he could leave to his work, which seemed perfect. So I did I went to tell him my plan. But guess what he said no coz he was already late and I looked at the time and yhea he was already late so I dicided to just be patience coz my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving so I just sat down and watched tv while my mom was finishing up. My mum had went insid the room and so I got up and asked if she was done and she said “yes” I so yelled so you are tackeing me and so she did I was so happy I rushed to the car and so we went and I went and my mom had left and that was the day I got to go to my friends house for just being patience.
786	18713	7	3	I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait calmly at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in a long line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up from school, or waiting quietly for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to finish her coffee and drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to be passed out, for a slow class to be over, for lunch to finally start, and for night to come so I can sleep. I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know what that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out one day. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday for many small things. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy having it.
787	18714	7	3	On @DATE2 I finally understood what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn't get @CAPS1 anything special for @CAPS2 because she had to pay all the bills first. She thought that she wasn't doing a lot for @CAPS1, but I told her I'm fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn't understand that she was doing good on her own; my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids by herself and @NUM2 of them are his. But my daddy would always say he knew if he had it he would give it to @CAPS1. But being @CAPS1, I didn't want to hear his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to find two jobs, to keep up with everything and all of us. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok until my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all her funeral stuff; she looked pretty and everything went well but now we still cry and think about her. That was a time I didn't have any patience because it was too hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she's in a better place with some of her love ones. But to this day I can't understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten.
788	18715	7	3	The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only supposed to be three hours long but one of the cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to get past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited patiently at a gas station and they finally caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to prepare them appropriately for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time as we all waited. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the road to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs that said “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1” and “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead” and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said “@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1”! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives, all because we had been patient! By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong.
789	18716	7	3	“@PERSON1 lets go this line is taking too long!” “@CAPS1 @PERSON2 just be patient!” “@CAPS2?” asked @PERSON2. “@CAPS3 @NUM1” replied @PERSON1. “@CAPS4 @CAPS2?” “You have never heard of patient?” “@CAPS1” “@CAPS6 you want to tell me that out of all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience?” “@CAPS1” “@CAPS6 your trying to tell me that out of all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience?” “@CAPS9” @PERSON2 replied in a confused voice. “@CAPS10 @CAPS12 well patient is when. Wow I never knew patience would be @CAPS6 hard to explain.” “@CAPS11 now do you get why I don't know!” “I got it!” he yelled as he snapped his fingers. @CAPS16 one in the line was staring at them. Their faces turned red. But @PERSON1 ignored that fact and said, “@CAPS12 @CAPS6 patience is like when you wait a long time but you don't care that you wait a long time and in the end because you @CAPS20 patiently you get what you wanted.” @CAPS6 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 @CAPS20 and @CAPS20 and @CAPS20 in line. Soon @CAPS21 they were up next. “@CAPS14 tickets to @CAPS15 @CAPS16 where I look please:” @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 said excitedly. “@CAPS17 ummm hold on one sec while I open a new package of tickets.” the ticket booth man told them. @PERSON2 glared at @PERSON1 then said “@CAPS12 @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21: @CAPS19 @CAPS20 in this line for twenty minutes and now I have to wait more?” “@CAPS23 you go kids that's @CAPS14 dollars please.” @PERSON2 was embarrassed but yet happy he got his tickets, @PERSON1 said “@CAPS11 you @CAPS20 and got what you wanted that's called patience.” @CAPS6 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 sat down in the movie theater and watched a great movie. If they weren't patient they would have never gotten to @CAPS11 their new favorite movie!
790	18717	7	3	Patience is a key role in life. If you are not patient, you will live an unhappy and frustrated life. Almost everything in life calls for some patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arouse something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co-workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can't stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me in the end. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my lack of patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and more fun with the people I'm around everyday. That is why when you are patient, you will often get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get your way, it will never happen.
791	18718	7	3	A time I was patient was when my friend was coming over and I was very excited. But I waited and waited for what felt like a very long time. I kept checking the window and looking at the clock, but she was not there yet. But she finna showed up in the end. That's about it, and I was happy she finally arrived.
792	18719	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait for my grandpa in the emergency room. We were there for his heart because he is not doing very well. My grandpa is in and out of the emergency room often for his heart condition. Every single day, my grandpa has to go see his doctor to check up on his heart and make sure he is okay. Any time we are at the hospital, it is a long and worrying wait. That is why I am a patient person when I need to be.
793	18720	7	3	Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed in your mind. I have been patient almost every day in school this year. This means being patient with my teachers during long lessons. I have also been patient with other kids at school who like to pick on people and tease them for no reason. I have patience some days, and on other days it feels like something is going wrong and that means I don’t have any more patience left. I like having patience because it makes you feel relaxed and everything seems easier to handle. Patience is a good thing that you can have in life. I even think patience increases your life span by reducing stress. Many people in the world don’t have that much patience, and I think that decreases your life span because they are always angry. I don’t think if I didn’t have any patience I would be in school right now, cause some kids just have problems and they don’t have patience and they get bad grades and everything becomes harder for them.
794	18721	7	3	In this narrative essay I will write about a few different times when I was out and I had to be patient. Such as when I was waiting to get out of school on a holiday. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my new video game. Another thing I had to wait for was to get my final test score back, as in the results, and all these times I had to be understanding. One day I was very anxious to get out of school on a Friday. And to make it feel bad, the clock was dragging and I had a planned schedule for my whole day. When one thought passed by, there was like another one setting in, and I was thinking of ways I could stare at the clock and it would change faster. I was about to get a call home for being restless, but the teacher saved me by starting a fun activity. And I had to be understanding about that moment and wait calmly. Another time I had to be understanding was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a good grade last year on my report card and a new game was coming out so I wanted it as a reward. My mom was asleep and it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before and was very tired. And that was the time I had to be patient and wait for her to get up on her own.

Here is a major scene in the first book. “Hey, are we there yet?” the little girl asked with curiosity in her voice. “No, not yet,” the guide replied with a sound of fear in her voice. They were lost, really lost in the big forest. “Are we there yet?” little Anna asked again, tugging on a cloak. “Please, Anna, you’ll just have to be patient,” the warrior said, becoming annoyed very quickly. So they walked for hours, but still no sign of the castle. Little Anna was eager to meet the queen, for she had imagined the queen as a kind, patient, and beautiful woman. The warrior could see that Anna was tired; lifting her onto her shoulders she said to Anna, “Look, see if you can spot the castle from here.” After a few long, patient minutes, Anna finally saw the castle towers. “I see it, I see it!” she said with a big smile. Jumping off of the warrior’s shoulder, she bolted down the narrow path way. Because she had waited so long, she was as excited as ever. Not only because she had found the castle but because she had learned how to be patient on the journey.
796	18723	7	3	A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient. I waited in the waiting room for about fifteen minutes, trying to calm my nerves, and then the assistant finally called me in. First, she told me what she was going to do, explaining each step of the procedure. Second, she took an x-ray of my teeth to see their alignment. Third, she put metal bonds with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth to secure them. Fourth, the orthodontist put the brackets on with really strong glue, which felt a bit strange. Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal bands, tightening everything into place. Finally, she asked me what color I wanted for the bands, then she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit still in a dental chair for that entire long time. I had to use a lot of patience; it was hard but I did it. That is the time I had to be truly patient.
797	18724	7	3	“So what do you want for your birthday?” “A PlayStation.” “What else do you want?” “Just a PlayStation.” I have been wanting a PlayStation 5 for so long. It was my thirteenth birthday and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted one… I wanted one really bad. The only exception was that it cost five hundred dollars and I already had a one hundred dollar birthday party; all together it would be a six hundred dollar birthday. So my mom and I decided on an agreement: I pay half then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my birthday. I didn’t want any other presents; I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over, give you your present, and celebrate. I knew that's where I would get my three hundred dollars. Everything seemed perfect; I had it all planned out. Have the family party a couple days after my birthday then go buy my PlayStation! I didn’t mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. “Hey mom, when are we having the family party?” “Next month.” At that moment there was steam coming out of my ears; I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You may not realize it, but next month is a whole month away from my birthday. If waiting thirty days isn’t patient then I don’t know what is. From this day on I still haven’t gotten my PlayStation, but two days from now I’ll be holding a stack of cash in my hands and heading to Gamertop. If I had to wait any longer I probably wouldn’t have made it. I’m not very patient, but this experience certainly tested me.
798	18725	7	3	A time I was patient was at my friend’s cousin’s birthday party. I was patient because the whole entire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friend’s parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaur pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and ice cream, decorated and painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, and watched my friend’s cousin open his presents and much, much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little nap, but it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go, and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover. But then my friend’s mom said not tonight because my friend has a volleyball game in the morning. It felt like I waited for nothing at all. Then I realized that when you're patient, you get what you want more often, even if it doesn't happen right away.
799	18726	7	3	Being patient is important, as I’ve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins Leo and Max. Leo is eight years old, and Max is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my aunt anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn’t get paid. I was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle Leo and Max. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my aunt’s house at about one thirty on the dot. Leo and Max had just gotten back from a friend’s birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like candy, cake, and ice cream. I could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My aunt left and I was stuck with them. Leo wanted to play on his PlayStation. But Max wanted to play Xbox. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call my aunt when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a board game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. Leo and Max played tag while I watched. However, Max, being the unfair one, denied that Leo had tagged him, and began to pout. I was frustrated at them immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, I told them that only I would count so they wouldn’t fight. Finally, my aunt came home and I got paid the money I had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards, both in money and in personal satisfaction.
800	18727	7	3	Patience is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient; if you're not patient that means you are just about practically mean because you are judging someone or making them do something really fast. For example, if you are waiting in line for a ride at an amusement park or something, then if you are patient you're being nice to other people by not trying to hurry them or something like that. If you are impatient and you are standing in line, you would be mean to other people by saying things like “hurry up, I want to be on that ride” or “hurry up and start the ride already.” That is the example. If you are a patient person, people will probably like you and appreciate your calm demeanor. If you are impatient, then you will probably have a hard time getting along with somebody, as your frustration can push others away.
801	18729	7	3	There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the state test; we had a very long time for the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldn’t go on to the next part. Also we couldn’t talk or get out of our seats. I really wanted to go on to the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Everyone in the class got done early too, and since we couldn’t talk we just sat and waited for the testing time to be over. I think everyone wanted to go to the next part but we didn't; nobody complained or said anything. We had to do this for a few days every year, and every year I’m always patient. That is a story on when I’m patient, showing how I waited quietly without causing any fuss.
802	18730	7	3	"Patience is when you understand and you don’t complain. A person who is patient is someone who can wait and they don’t whine every two seconds. A person like that can succeed in life. My teacher was getting closer, moving from desk to desk. First she went to one student, then another, and another. She was coming down my row next. This was a nerve-wracking moment; I wondered when someone would pinch me so I could wake up from this anxiety. Then she stopped at my desk and said my name. The teacher looked at me and with a disappointed tone stated that I had done a poor section on this test. I think you should put more effort in, she advised. In my mind I was praying for her not to say the words that would mean summer school, but she responded by saying I needed tutoring. When I got home my mom read the letter and agreed with it. Why did I have to fail history? The next week the tutor arrived. We sat down and she was about to say something, so I took a deep breath, remembering you have to be patient and avoid complaining. I nodded my head with a smile so big it looked like my lips were about to fall off. A few weeks later, I got a little better every day. Her name was Mrs. Smith, and she was very nice and thoughtful. She told me I was progressing by waiting and seeing the results. Finally, the hundred-point test came. I was nervous but confident at the same time; that test is going in, I wished it the best for me! A week later the teacher passed back the graded papers. A smile was on her face as she said, ""Good job, you got an A-."" It was hard in the beginning but I was patient and I got a good grade. The lesson is to wait and don’t nag and see the results at the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant; a person who is patient is a person who accomplishes a goal."
803	18731	7	3	A time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister, my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at three o'clock. I was getting my hair cut by an official barber, but the shop was very crowded that day. I waited all the way until five o'clock to finally get my hair cut. I sat quietly in the waiting area, watching others get their turns before me without complaining. That was a time I was patient, understanding that good things come to those who wait calmly for their opportunity.
804	18732	7	3	A time I was patient is now during the summer. The reason is because I am waiting for my new phone. See, last month, I spilled orange juice on my phone. Everybody would call me weird and irresponsible. At first my phone was fine and everything was alright. Then one day the speaker stopped working. I couldn't call anyone or listen to music. My heart sank. I quickly ran to my dad and told him about the problem. He first laughed and shook his head. Then he grabbed my phone to test it. After he checked it and it did not work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how did that happen. Now at the time I was so stunned, so I couldn't figure it out. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from my dad, but I told him anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a 'why are you laughing, dad' expression. He said, “You are going to have to wait until I get the money.” My face was calm, but here I am still waiting for the phone, practicing patience every day.
805	18733	7	3	Sarah was your average fourteen year old. She had a mother, a father and an annoying eight year old brother named Tim. Her parents weren’t that eligible with names. It was the beginning of school and her mother had to take her brother clothes shopping for his new school. Problem is she made Sarah go in with them. Sarah wouldn’t complain for a month, she decided. Patience, oh patience, did she have to be a saint? Sigh. Oh well, too late now. Sarah thought here she was, in the boys department helping her mother pick out clothes for her brother. Out of the corner of her eye she sees someone from her class, daring to get a better look, she gasped. She could fail to have those guys see her at school since she was picking out clothes in the boys department! I stared, she needed to get to the girls bathroom and stay there until they were ready to get her. The entire time was awkward. “Thank you for being so understanding,” her mother said. “I know that was hard for you and I appreciate you not complaining.” “You know what,” Sarah thought, “patience is a good thing.” She concluded this as she finally got out of the store and into the car.
806	18734	7	3	When I was at a local shop I unexpectedly found my friend from the neighborhood and he started to talk to me about patience. He began to explain the topic to me and I told him that I didn't really know what that concept meant in a deeper sense. We started a conversation about it and he began to explain to me what it was and how the idea of patience first started to be produced in philosophical thought. Then he told me a detailed story about that and I was genuinely learning about the history and the story behind the virtue. It was an enlightening discussion that gave me a new perspective.
807	18736	7	3	Every day I have to be patient, and actually, every one has to be patient in their own way. But have you ever been patient for a sibling? If so then you know exactly how I felt when my sister didn’t want to go out side out of her own self wanting reasons. The other day I was trying to get my sister to go out side with me because we have a special willow tree that we hang out at, but anyway, I was getting off topic. Since she kept refusing to get out and exercise I had to result to telling my mother, and you can imagine she didn’t listen to me either. My sister brought a book, we started to walk and then? We got to a pathway in the middle of my neighbor hood and we went separate ways. I, of course, didn’t like this and had to wait at a friends house for what felt like a long time until she realized I wasn't going to follow her. So I’ve been annoyed with patience, but I’ve heard it’s a virtue so I guess I have to be okay with that for now.
808	18737	7	3	Patience, I understand, is the ability to be tolerant, and patient people sometimes experience difficulty with waiting. Today we will talk about what patience means for us in our daily lives. It is a concept that requires time and understanding. Sometimes it is hard to practice, especially when someone is in front of you and they are not doing what you expect. But she was an honest person who tried her best. She struggled with it, but in the end, she learned a valuable lesson about self-control and calmness that she carries with her every day.
809	18738	7	3	One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming out that I really wanted. I asked my dad if we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until the official release date. So I waited patiently until the day arrived and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game and tried not to show my disappointment. It was then my birthday came and I opened my last gift; it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents a big hug and my brother and me went to play it together immediately, making the wait completely worthwhile.
810	18739	7	3	When you have patience you are calmer, more peaceful, and ultimately happier. It is like when your birthday is next week and you don’t want to wait for it and you start to get mad because you want your presents today not next week. But you can’t have them immediately, so you get mad and start to hit things and then you don’t get a good behavior report. Then you make your parents mad and then they might even bring some of your gifts back to the store. That is not patience. That is non-patience when you get mad because you can’t get what you want right away, and it only leads to more problems and fewer rewards. Learning to wait calmly is the true key to getting what you want in the end.
811	18740	7	3	"The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. My family were loading up for a three-hour drive to the popular water park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if he was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother Tyler was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until he finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" he exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" Tyler was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than he had. Which tells you a lot? Tyler comes out five minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another ten minutes which my brother mad. ""What took you so long?"" Tyler asked. ""We had to make sure uncle John was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered. As soon as we got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least we were all patient, except for my brother Tyler's still like that now, always in a rush to get somewhere."
812	18741	7	3	Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I canít tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didnít mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called Justice For Girls. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister Emily who was ten. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about fifteen minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, another shopper raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited fifteen minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about twenty minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another five minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether itís a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around, a lesson I carry with me always.
813	18742	7	3	I was very patient last time I went to the doctors, I and my brother Michael had to wait outside in the waiting room until they called us in for our shots. Everybody else was getting to go a head of as and we stayed patient. It got really boring sitting in there but we stayed patient, reading old magazines and watching the clock on the wall. After about two or three hours we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago. So we decide to go up and ask what was going on, our initial patience finally wearing thin. We found out that we forgot to sign in and so once we did we got in, proving that a little proactive questioning after a long wait can sometimes solve the problem.
814	18743	7	3	Being patient is about waiting your turn without being cleam you don't complain about waiting like being patient throw the day and waiting for school to get out. Not complaining about school being to long or fakeing sick just to go home or fakeing pinkeye. Ect. You mue to wait for school to get out Being Patient isn't wait for something to  get over it can be about wait for lines. Waiting to use some thing like the bathroom or a computer. Ect. Not all people are patien. I not a very patien person when it comes to getting home on time! I don't like waiting for people or my ride or food! I'm very patien when it comes to shots or anything to do with doctors, sitting calmly while others might fret and worry.
815	18744	7	3	"It was one Saturday morning in wisconson last day of deer hunting. I got up and dressed me my dad and friend where all sitting down to eat we had pankacs and milk. Out side it was about twenty degrees so we buttered up and  and headed at. I was kind of scary in the worst at night because we don't know whats out there or whos out there. but after we got in the deer stand all my ways went away. After three hours in the stand my dad tells me ""Son time to get back and eat"" not right now"" l said ""Okay"" said my dad then l guess I'll see you latter so after he came back it wa right around noon when out of the bruch came the buck l was wating for. So l bought my gun up and shot he went right down. I have never been  so proud in my life The wait in the cold stand had finally paid off."
816	18745	7	3	"Patience, if you are a patient person you are tolerant and understanding. There was a time I was very patient. ""Mom, can I go yet!?"" ""No,"" she replied, ""I need to buy all of your school supplies."" I always didn't like back to school shopping. That would mean going with my mom to a store for two hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencils, binders, and pens. ""But I really have to go too?"" ""Just be patient, ok?"" ""Fine,"" I replied. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I began to get more patient. Whenever I had to wait for my mom, I just sat there quietly. I just sat down and waited calmly. And the day seemed to go by a lot faster; it had been two hours but it only felt like twenty minutes when we left. I wouldn't wait till next year, I wanted to go shopping all over again because I had learned the value of patience."
817	18747	7	3	When you are patient you are calm and without complaining. And you are understanding and tolerant of delays. And when you are patient with something you are steady with it and do not give up easily. Because if you are nervous you are not patient; patience gives you a lot of time to think. And a person who is very calm and steady is a patient person. And a patient person experiences difficulties without getting overly upset. And when a patient person is waiting to get something, they do not complain or become frustrated; that is what it means to be patient. And when you have patience, you remain calm and steady even in frustrating situations, which is a valuable quality to possess.
818	18748	7	3	Patience, having patience means you don’t complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding of the situation. Some reasons why you should have patience are things like waiting in line. You might have to wait in an extremely long line and the whole time you are waiting you say things like, “Man, this takes forever.” Or, “Ugh, when will they just leave.” “Can’t they just hurry?” Your mom would be thinking, “Oh my gosh would you just stop talking?” Or she would just want to scream. So your mom probably wouldn’t ever want to take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are too impatient to handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldn’t want to be patient or you would want to be impatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would make a bad first impression. So your mom is taking forever talking on the phone so you keep saying, “We have to go now, Mom we have to go now!” Then you wait very impatiently. Although, patience is basically like a kind, gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, you're picturing yourself screaming at someone who you’re waiting on, on the outside you are calmly waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try it sometimes; just don’t let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside, and you will find things go much more smoothly.
819	18749	7	3	Patience is when you are waiting on something without getting upset. When you rush, that’s not being patient. When you are being patient you don’t rush and you remain calm. That's another meaning of patience: when you stay calm that’s being patient, staying calm and not getting angry. Some people say they are losing their patience, which means that they are about to get angry. Those are the meanings of patience. There was a time I was being patient. I waited for my friend to come. I waited, and I waited, and I waited; I didn’t rush because they said it was my friend’s birthday. In the bible it says to be patient and I did what it said. It was no telling when my friend was coming, but I still waited patiently and finally my friend came, which made the wait worthwhile.
820	18750	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when my dad came home from work. I was getting very hungry, so I went inside and asked, ""When is dinner ready, Mom?"" She said it would be ready in about an hour. So I decided to wait patiently instead of complaining. I found a book to read and sat on the sofa, letting the time pass quietly. Before I knew it, the hour was up and my mom called me for a delicious dinner, proving that patience makes the waiting easier."
821	18751	7	3	Being patient is a valve that can release the pressure of difficult situations. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her kind uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not to worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch out for the wicked witch everyone feared. @PERSON1 skips off happily to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks straight to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle had lovingly built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the small door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked witch, who captured her. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry terribly. He searched and searched for her through the dark woods but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was incredibly hard, not knowing where she was. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that he had kidnapped @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again, trusting the system from his jail cell. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was freed and reunited with his niece. From that day on, @ORGANIZATION1 truly understood the value of patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient.
822	18752	7	3	This week I have been very patient, which is a big accomplishment for me. I really wanted a wii and no one would buy me one, so I knew I had to get it myself. So I saved up my money for so long, doing small chores and forgoing other treats. Then I had to wait for it to arrive, and what felt like weeks was actually @NUM1 long days (which is @NUM2 week). I was counting down the days one by one. That just made it feel even longer, watching the calendar. So I decided to tell my self I didn’t want it so I wasn’t anxious to get it, trying to trick my own mind. That kind of worked, but the desire was still there. But when I finally got it, to tell you the truth, it isn’t as fun as I thought it would be, which was a surprising lesson about wanting things.
823	18753	7	3	In my opinion, I am a very impatient person, and it shows in many parts of my life. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something, they’d better stop it on the spot or @PERSON1 I rate, child makes a huge breakthrough, also, I am not one of those kids who waits patiently for dinner, I snack my way right to it, ruining my appetite! and when I am at school, I just can't stand @CAPS1 listening to meap instructions for hours on end; it feels like torture. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy with his own impatience! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one tiny noise, he immediately goes on a rampage, yelling and slamming his hand on the desk! Overall I think people need more patience these days, myself and my teacher included, to make life smoother.
824	18754	7	3	Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack, but it is a powerful virtue. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient for the past couple years, building his team slowly. He did not try to make his team be better than they were; he just had them try their @CAPS2 and see what the end result was, learning from each game. The @ORGANIZATION4 ended up going @NUM1 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3 they earned the second pick in the twenty tend @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft the @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5, an defensive lineman out of the @ORGANIZATION2. He is an outstanding player and the @ORGANIZATION4 other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out of the @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team is so good this year precisely because of @PERSON1's patience with his team and his deep understanding of his player's individual talents.
825	18756	7	3	Who likes being patient? It’s so boring and feels unproductive. Pretty much all it does is waste your time, or so it seems. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience for a reason. I am not a really patient person but they’re lots of times where I have had to be patient. When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me, so it was a full house. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station to share between us all. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller, which made things worse. It was really hard to be patient to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off, hogging the screen. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it immediately. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain; I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in, listening. I sat there with tears in my eyes, feeling the time pass. I felt empty but I was still not complained, practicing patience. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 long hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play, which was all I wanted. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it, just be patient and it will pay off in the end.
826	18757	7	3	"A time that I showed patience is when my sister broke my futon. It was the very day that I had gotten it, and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a sudden I heard ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!"" I ran upstairs to find out what happened and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost. I showed patience by not yelling at them, even though I was very upset inside. I took a deep breath and calmly asked them what had occurred. I soon got another futon that isn't broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And that is my story on how I showed patience once!"
827	18758	7	3	"One day when I was walking outside I found a snake on a rock. I yelled for my big brother who was playing his game. He said, ""hold on I need to beat the level,"" but the snake was getting agitated so I said, ""now!"" Finally, after ten minutes he came out of the house and stared at what was in my hand. He asked me, ""why do you have a snake?"" I replied, ""I saw it and thought it was cool."" He looked at it, decided he liked it, and then we let it go together in the grass."
828	18759	7	3	"One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were asleep, our parents were on the computer. @CAPS4 usually don't stay up that late, so I just thought @CAPS2 was doing something for work. In the @TIME1, when we woke up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. ""I wonder @CAPS3 it could be…."" I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom, ""@CAPS3's going on!?!"" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowly brought up a document from behind his back presenting it to us. The heading on the document said ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 parents were smirking @CAPS11 @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 if we were reading each other's mind, we both well knew that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the @CAPS15 on the paper. ""@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2"" it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2, ""That's like, two months away!!!"" ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, ""you must be patient."" @CAPS11 normal kids did, I said, ""@CAPS12…"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 disappointment and said, ""@CAPS14 things come to those who wait."" I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to rough the two months out and be patient. The first couple weeks felt like months to us. We were oh so anxious @CAPS11 you would guess. But, @CAPS11 time progressed the patience got easier. I was able to focus on other things beside the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time came for us to head on a plane for the cruise. ""That quick! It went by that quick! I'm so excited, @CAPS2!"" I said when we were boarding the plane. ""I'm proud of you, son. You were patient!"" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS14 things will come to those who wait."""
829	18760	7	3	I’m going to tell you a time when I was patient. A time I was patient was when I had to save up my money to get the new game Halo Reach. I had to pre-order it with my own money, so I did a bunch of work. I cut the lawn at my house and then I cut other people's lawn for two dollars, so I did that for about two months. At the end, I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre-ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks, so I did just that. I waited patiently and bought some other small stuff with the left over money, and the game finally came in the mail. That’s a time I used patience to wait for something I really wanted.
830	18761	7	3	"Once there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day @PERSON1 was going to get her driver's licence. She was to go and was so excited to be able to drive. When @PERSON1 got to the licence place she saw that there were a lot of people waiting. She estimated about @NUM1 people were there. ""@CAPS1 did there have to be so many people here,"" she thought to herself. After about @NUM2 minutes of waiting she got @CAPS6 mad, because only one person got his licence in that time period. She threw a big fit right there. ""Ugghh! I was supposed to get my licence today not wait around for a bunch of experienced adults to get their licence renewed!"" she started blabbering and said, ""@CAPS1 do you guys take so long! You are so slow!"" She went home and started talking to her friend @CAPS3 on the cell phone. ""@CAPS2 there were many people I am never going to get my licence @CAPS3!"" ""@PERSON1 just calm down. Stop being so impatient."" ""@CAPS4 the line was so long and—"" @PERSON2 cut @PERSON1 off. ""@CAPS5 you keep running home crying, you will never get your license. The line for a driver licence is always that long. I had to wait @NUM2 hours to get mine."" ""@CAPS6 five hours!"" ""@CAPS7, @CAPS4 I took @NUM4 hours with me so I wouldn’t be bored. Take your phone with you."" ""@CAPS8,"" @PERSON1 replied. The next day she went back to the licence place; she took her phone and a book with her. While she waited, she texted her friend, went online and read her book for her book project. She kept moving in the line @CAPS4 she didn’t even realize @CAPS11. @PERSON1 waited for @NUM5 hours that day @CAPS4 she only thought @CAPS11 was @NUM4 because she was preoccupied. @PERSON1 felt great when she finally got her licence; she was the second one in school to get her licence (after @PERSON2). ""@CAPS9 @PERSON2, you taught me how to be patient and calm down."" ""@CAPS10 problem, @CAPS11’s the least I could do for my best friend."""
831	18762	7	3	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant, calmly enduring difficulties without complaining. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. One day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didn’t know about. After school I waited in the parking lot for close to thirty minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up, watching as other students gradually left until I was nearly alone. I was starting to think my parents weren’t coming until a teacher noticed me and asked what I was doing. After I explained my situation the teacher kindly let me call my parents. My dad apologized and went to get me after I explained, and then I could finally go home. This experience taught me the value of staying calm.
832	18763	7	3	I’ve been patient plenty of times, but when I ordered a new game console is when I had to be particularly patient. My dad and I were getting a game console that would be at our porch in two weeks. For me it felt like a life time, but I had to keep patient and focus on other activities. Not for those fourteen days did I complain, neither did my dad, as we both understood the delivery process. when it finally came, it was definitely worth the wait, and we enjoyed setting it up together. That is a time when it was necessary to have patience and to not complain, and it made the reward even better.
833	18764	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at the festival. I wanted to get something to eat and the line was big, stretching far from the counter. Another time is when I wanted to get on a ride the line was giantle large. It was for the massive, towering pirate ship, the swing, which looked exciting from a distance. There was also a line to play this basketball game and it was big, with many people ahead of me. Despite the long waits, I remained calm and eventually got to enjoy the activities, which made the day fun.
834	18765	7	3	Have you ever had enough patience to deal with seven screaming kids? I can proudly say that I can. It all started when my uncle Steve and Aunt Mary decided to move to Florida. They needed a lot of help so my Aunt decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to Florida to help them. The only problem was there were seven kids and only one of her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My Aunt has an expedition car so all seven of us could fit. But, it didn't take long for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the seven kids start fighting. My Aunt got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was at least a DVD player in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn't get to watch it. After about two hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about five hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then BANG! Everybody screamed, even my Aunt. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about ten hours we reached Florida. It was three in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patience I had. After that I don't think that I want to go on a road trip again, but I learned I can handle more than I thought.
835	18766	7	3	Patience is when you have problems and don’t complain, accepting situations with calmness. You need patience at an amusement park to wait in all the long lines for the popular rides. Patience is also not complaining about being bored on a long car ride, finding ways to occupy your mind. You need to be patient to fish or to be rewarding, as it can save others headaches and make the experience more peaceful. You won't always be stressed if you are patient, approaching challenges with a relaxed attitude. So you should always be patient; it can make your life so much easier, long lines won't seem so long, and fishing is very rewarding for those with patience.
836	18767	7	3	Patient day. I remember the time when I was patient for a toy car. Four years old, I had to wait for four whole days. Each day it felt like I was in jail. So I was getting mad each day, slapping people in the face; it was so funny, but my dad and grandma were mad at me. Then my mom put me on punishment. Then a couple days later I was doing good in school. So my mom was so proud of me. Then she bought me a lot of stuff. Later that Christmas day we had turkey and ranch dressing. Then I opened my presents. I got the toy car, two monster truck cars, shoes, and Nike’s blue, red, and all colors you can think of. So that is why I was patient for that toy; I was so happy and my grandpa stopped by and gave me three dollars. Then he took me ice skating, and I had to wear these skinny tights. But it all worked out for me at the end. I got everything I wanted and I even got a loud touch with the three cars. It felt like I was rich for Christmas day.
837	18768	7	3	"One day this girl really wanted to go school shopping. She had to wait because her mother said she didn't get her money now; she would get it later. Her mom said wait until later. The girl did not know that her new stuff was up in her room, so when her mom got back, the girl had said, ""When are we going to go?"" Her mom said, ""Go get your jacket upstairs in your room."" The girl went upstairs to get her jacket, and when she went up in her room, she saw new clothes and five pairs of new shoes. The girl had to scream, and she came downstairs and told her mom thank you. Her mom said, ""You're welcome."" Her mom said, ""I told you I was going to get your stuff."" And the girl said, ""You just have to wait with patience."""
838	18769	7	3	Patience is a feeling that you get when you experience a difficult task and do your best to overcome it without complaining about the task, like when you're getting paint out and then you squeeze the tube and it won’t come out, but you still keep trying until you figure out that it is all gone. Then you go get a new bottle to start using. I wish that more people were patient, then we wouldn’t have to listen to constant complaining from others. The world would be a much more peaceful place if everyone practiced a little more patience in their daily lives.
839	18770	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was when I had to watch my little brothers and my two cousins. This was going to take a lot of patience. One day I got a phone call from my aunt. She said she needed a babysitter for my two-year-old and seven-year-old cousins. She said she would pay me if I would watch them. So I said sure. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. A couple days later, my mom came home and it turned out pretty good for me after all. The children were finally calm, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment for having managed everything so well.
840	18771	7	3	Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to Cedar Point. When we went to Cedar Point we all were ready to ride the Magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line, and after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop; the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful, but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the people started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good everything worked out until we got to the bumper cars, where our patience was tested once again, but we managed to have fun regardless.
841	18772	7	3	"Waiting into the grand double doors of the fravential I am greeted by a man in a suit. ""Welcome to the fravsthat,"" the man says as soon as we enter. We can walk on further to the main hall, a vast space opening up in front of us. ""When does the show start?"" I ask excitedly. ""Not until about eight thirty,"" my mom replies. Eight thirty was about an hour away and we couldn’t sit down due to the crowd ahead of us. Ten minutes passes by and only one person was admitted into the show. Not even the elegant music could mask the crowd's uproar. Another fifteen minutes passes and our seats finally await us. Walking down the walk way I ease into seat forty-two as the show begins, the lights dimming to a hush."
842	18773	7	3	Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. Patience is a good one to have too, as it can help you in a lot of situations. If you have patience, you won't get nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend Sarah was getting me. I didn’t think about the gift that much so the wait didn’t really get to me. I knew the present was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. I was still able to keep the curiosity off my mind. I had to make sure I didn’t think about it, so I wouldn’t beg my friend to know what it was, because that would be impatient. If you're impatient people might get annoyed because you will always ask questions, and get on their nerves. It is good to be patient with friendships, so you don’t become mean to them or anyone else. It is certainly not good to be impatient with your family. If you are patient you can work things out better, and stay more on task and focused, leading to more harmonious relationships.
843	18774	7	3	When you're at a store or the doctor or anywhere where you have to wait for something, you always have to have patience or you will never be able to do anything. I remember when I was at the store with my mom we had to wait in this long line just to buy a few groceries. But if we didn’t have patience we would have put our stuff back and went back home. Since we did have patience we got to buy our stuff and complete our errand for the day. That is why, if you don't have patience you won’t be able to do anything you want to do, as many worthwhile things in life require waiting.
844	18775	7	3	"Here’s a story about a time when I was patient. So the story begins at Art Prize, and I loved to see the beautiful art there, but I was dying to see the winning picture. My parents told me to wait until we all see the rest of the Art Prize's amazing art. So I sighed and replied, ""Okay, we can see the rest of the Art Prize things first."" While we were looking at the art the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That is all I thought about for a while. A little bit later, I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at Art Prize. So I cheered up and decided patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while, it all of a sudden seems more valuable. A couple hours later I started to head to the car, and my mom interrupted and said, ""Don’t you want to see the winning piece of art?"" ""Oh yes, I forgot,"" I replied. There was not a line now, so when we went to see it there was no crowd. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of soldiers drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patience is important, because that way it was worth the wait to see something that you like, making the experience even more special."
845	18776	7	3	"A time when someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have a sleepover with my friend Lily. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversary dinner. It was around six pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish pepperoni pizza. Halfway through dinner I got a text from my next door neighbor, who is my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parents are out, they’ll be back in a few hours, and that I’ll ask later. Finally, around nine pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. My mom said, ""I don’t know,"" and walked away. About an hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted Lily and said that I could. She replied, ""Finally!"" Now I had to go pack. Quickly, I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, ""I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!"" So I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to Lily's house she opened the door and let me in. I said, ""Sorry it took so long. Thanks for being so patient!"""
846	18777	7	3	"I don’t have a time when I’m patient, so today I'm going to write about how impatient I am. I think one day I was in a long line at the store. It was a hot day and I was ready to go to my cool and big house to relax and chill out. You all know how old people are; they walk slow and talk too much, if you haven't already noticed. One of those people was in front of me. He was taking all day taking out his wallet and talking too much to the cashier. So I said, ""You know what, I’ll just go to another store and get me a Slurpee right now, I can’t deal with this slowness on such a humid day,"" and I left the line immediately."
847	18778	7	3	"Being patient can sometimes be very hard, especially when whatever you are being patient about is really distracting and painful. This is the story of how I had to be patient when I fell outside and hurt myself. One day, my brother and I were playing outside. We were having fun throwing water balloons at each other. I was already soaked from head to toe, but we still kept playing. Suddenly, I heard a buzzing sound by my ear. I turned around and saw a huge bee next to me. I was only eight years old and very afraid of bees. I turned and ran down the driveway and kept going around the house, thinking that the bee was still following me. I was starting to get tired, so I tripped and fell, scraping off a good amount of skin in the process. I immediately began to cry when I saw blood passing from the cut. I ran inside to tell my mom. ""Mom! I fell!"" I managed to scream between sobs. ""Oh my gosh! Let me go find some band-aids,"" my mother replied. The pain was intolerable for my little body. I kept silently crying, but I knew I had to be patient while my mom went to look for bandages. Just last week I had wasted a bunch of band-aids by plastering them across my doll's face. I had to be patient and wait for a long time, till my mother finally found the bandages. ""I found them!"" my mom said, while running down the stairs into the living room where I was sitting. ""Thank you for being so patient."" She stuck the band-aids across the cut on my leg and then gave me a lollipop. I knew I had been a good girl by being patient and waiting calmly."
848	18779	7	3	Yo! I’m the narrator, you know, the dude that tells the story. Well, I’m gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is Arnie. Now Arnie is no ordinary armadillo. Arnie was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So Arnie, being the smart armadillo he is, thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. Arnie went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal, so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. It took him many days of careful work, hammering and shaping the metal. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. Arnie was no longer made fun of. Arnie had to be patient to make his shell, and his patience finally paid off.
849	18780	7	3	Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people can’t be patient. For example, my brother. If he orders something online or is waiting for dinner to be prepared, he always has to be whiny about when he’s going to get what he wants. I’m not like that. I actually have patience. For example, I needed shoes so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the Nike store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom orders them online, and I was so excited. I waited and waited. After three days, I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldn’t drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was coming home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning everything up. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front porch. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lay there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were supposed to arrive on Friday but since you were patient, they came early.
850	18781	7	3	I have never been a “patient” person, unlike this girl I know named Sarah. She is always patient, like the time I was scared to go sledding down the hill and I would not go down. I kept saying, “I’m not going down the hill.” After about ten minutes later, she was still patient. She said, “What if I go down first, then will you go down?” I said yes, so she went down and then I went down. And on the day of last year’s dance, I was taking so long to get dressed; we were already late. Sarah was so very patient, and I was so surprised. I think she has a surplus of patience. I hope some of it rubs off on me because I need some, and as soon as possible, and a lot of it too, because I bet I’m the only person in the world without patience, wow! I really admire her for that.
851	18782	7	3	One rainy day my dad's leg was bothering him a great deal. He took some medicine but that didn't work, so we decided to take him to the hospital in Coro. They looked at his leg and told us we had to go to the main hospital, Covent Hospital in @LOCATION1, so we got on our way immediately. When we arrived at the hospital, there were like @NUM1 people in the waiting room, but my dad had the patience to wait without complaint. When we were finally called into the examination room, my dad had to get x-rays taken of his leg. He also had enough patience to wait calmly to see what was wrong with him. When he found out what was wrong, he had to wait even longer to see if he would need surgery on his leg. Well, after mustering all the patience he had, he had to go through with the surgery. He had enough patience to go through the entire surgery and the recovery that followed. It is a good thing my dad had all that patience because now his legs are all better, though I honestly didn't think my dad had enough patience in him for all of that.
852	18783	7	3	I am practicing patience every single day this year for the upcoming @CAPS1 so I can get some wonderful @CAPS2. I was buying @CAPS2 before, but I can’t buy any more now because @CAPS1 is coming up soon, which is why I have to be patient; it will seem longer if I keep getting excited about it. Every day requires patience; sometimes I can’t wait to get out of school so I can go outside and play. I’m always trying my best to be patient because it seems like one holiday arrives after another, and each one gets more exciting than the last. Every kid tries to be patient, but being patient is one of the most hard things to do when you are young. How I manage to be patient is I act like nothing exciting is even coming up, which helps the time pass a little faster until the celebration finally begins.
853	18784	7	3	Today was Thanksgiving. We had to drive up to the countryside to visit my cousins for our family dinner. The car ride was a long and burning @NUM1 hour trip. But the patience required was so hard; I wished I had a plane ticket to get there faster. I saw many cool things out the window to distract myself. We eventually turned off the highway and finally arrived at my cousin's house. With all the family gathered, we sat down, caught up with each other, and we gave out gifts. Then we enjoyed a wonderful @CAPS1, a delicious turkey dinner with all the @CAPS2. It was a warm and fulfilling end to a long journey that tested my patience.
854	18785	7	3	On my way to @STATE1 I was patient because I had to wait a long time for the buses to arrive. I also had to wait patiently on some of the stops along the route. It felt like there were @NUM1 buses that passed by, but I had to wait for the one going to @CAPS1. I had to go through all those haves and have-nots of travel. I was so tired that by the time the correct bus finally got there, I fell asleep almost immediately after finding my seat, grateful the waiting was finally over.
855	18786	7	3	Today was the final day of tryouts, the deciding day. Tryouts were over and I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to hand out the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I didn’t know if I could handle the suspense. “@CAPS1 until you’ve left the building to open your envelope,” @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS3’s only fair. If everyone opens them in here then people who don’t make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn’t make @CAPS3 feel even more bummed and left out. Be patient and @CAPS1 until you leave the building.” Then she called my name. I came up and grabbed my envelope with a nervous hand. She dismissed us, and some girls opened their envelopes right away against the instructions. But, they didn’t make @CAPS3—a bit of instant karma, I suppose. I waited until I got outside, as I was told. I could barely @CAPS1; I needed to know the result but I had to @CAPS1. Patience isn’t such a lovely thing always, especially in moments like these. Finally, I opened my envelope and read the letter inside: I made the team! I was so excited and I was truly glad I had the patience to @CAPS1 and be properly surprised by the wonderful news.
856	18787	7	3	It was my family vacation, we was going to Disney World. We was staying in the magical hotel is was, was beautiful you can see a real waterfall and it like haven. We was in this huge room it have two huge bathroom and bigs beds. Then as I look out of the window I can see rolercoster and all kind of ride. But they have come with these knew ride call the Ship breaker: it two hundred feet tall and big as the statin of libaty and it pikes you up drop you two hundred feet twist like a! Tarnado. It move from sides to side. Me and my mom and dad went there, we want to ride. But many people wateing in line. My parent wont use to ride a different ride but I wanted to rid this. So I got in line and wait, I knew I have to be patient but two hours pass I start to loss my patient. There was only a few people in front of me. Finaly it was my turn, I got on it, frist laft me up several hundred. Feet and dropedme, spin the around, twist me until I got tired and finally I got off it. You can see me crying but it was not a bad cry, it was a good cry so that was the time I was patient.
857	18788	7	3	I stood in the elevator tapping my foot, smooth jazz music humms out of speakers above me. Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting for their turn of departure on the flight. I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the polished floor as I searched for room 104. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up old magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did five minutes ago, “Mom how much longer?” The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, “not much longer now dear.” Sighing, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but can’t help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as she texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock she scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope. “Jane, the doctor is ready to see you now.” Relieved, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. “You know it’s funny,” she says well snapping her gum. “For someone so young you were the most patient person out there!” I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that I’m a patient person.
858	18789	7	3	One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctor’s because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor’s office’s and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom told it will only take two minutes. Guess what she was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was patient I texted my aunt and friends. I also played some games. I actually brought my Nintendo Switch with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored I went outside for some fresh air. Then I got tired I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess what my mom said “how are you sweety”, then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at McDonald's after the appointment. I was patient at the clinic so then we spent thirty minutes there. I was so tired I started to fall asleep in the car. I was proud of myself because I was patient; its not that hard to believe, its actually easy. That’s a lesson I learned that day.
859	18790	7	3	Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great jorney to california. I had to stand in six very long line for up to three hours it took forever to get on the plain when we finaly got there we were hungry so we had to wait inline for forty minutes when we were finally up to get our food we were starving we ate and went to a friends house we stayed for an hour it started to get bouring but I had patience and waited turns out it was not so bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life wether you are or arnt patient is up to you that week was all about patients and lines lots of both it was a long day. Sadly we had to leave after that day which equals. Yap you guessed it for patience first was had to go huston, texas then Dallas then we had to drive six hours to get home when we got home we were so tired and passed the story to my friends and family, who all agreed that my patience had been truly tested.
860	18791	7	3	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This Saturday, I went to my cousin’s house to watch her daughter Lisa’s baby, for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldn’t wait.When I got to their house, the baby was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldn’t hush. Tthen I said, “Sweetie, what’s the matter ?” As soon as I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because I stayed somewhat calm and I didn’t complain to Lisa’s mom, and that felt like a real accomplishment.
861	18792	7	3	Every year since I learned about Christmas and presents, now that I think about it, they never said you’d have to wait months until the holiday came around. I love Christmas, but once a year or so I am not patient enough to wait until December rolls downward. The first chilly day of December told me Christmas was coming along with all the decorating, carolling, and wistful feelings of holiday joy. I usually try to pass the time by having snowball wars with my cousins in the backyard. I still feel the temptation, trying to rush time, which makes me anxious, and it feels grueling to wait so long, but I still try to be patient and let the temptation go away. When Christmas Eve came, I feel grateful I made it this long with patience because I am just like my parents and can't wait for anything that takes a month. Then it comes around as slow as possible and then leaves quicker than I could think, leaving me to wonder how fast it left. Just like the saying, time flies when you're having fun, but the wait itself feels like an eternity.
862	18793	7	3	"Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old, I was extremely patient about an Avatar toy I wanted. Ever since Avatar: The Last Airbender was on television and in stories, I was crazy about them, and I still am today. Aang, the Avatar, is the only person in the Avatar world who can master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. Now I can write you a whole entire book about the show. So I saw an Avatar toy set on T.V. and I asked my mom if she could buy it. And she said when she got the money, but until then, no. So of course I was upset. So I was waiting, counting the days as they went by. Then finally that very payday came, and you know what that means. ""Payday, payday,"" the day has arrived, the day I get my toy, but I didn't know that she only got two hundred dollars, so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran upstairs and locked my door and cried myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the payday, and when my birthday was here, can you guess what? I finally got the best gift of all, the Avatar toy, and my mom said that all that patience I practiced got me what I wanted in the end."
863	18794	7	3	Patience is like waiting for something and you don't complain it's taking too long; you're just sitting there waiting quietly. Here is an example. One time I was waiting to go get a check-up at the doctor's office, and you're sitting there quietly, reading a magazine, and just waiting without making a fuss. That is a clear example of being patient, where you accept the wait without frustration. It is a valuable skill that helps in many situations throughout life.
864	18795	7	3	One day a kid was going to school and was going to turn in a paper for math that he did. During English class, he was doing a chapter sketch. His teacher called him over. The teacher asked if he had a page of a story that was due a month ago. The kid said no. The teacher asked why, and the kid said because he had been going to a basketball tournament. The teacher said he had until tomorrow. Then the next day the kid is at English class and said he was sorry but he didn't have his paper. The teacher asked why, and the kid said because his grandpa died. The teacher said okay, he could have one more day. Then the kid finally got his paper done and turned it in, learning the importance of meeting deadlines.
865	18796	7	3	I have been patient lots of times in my life, but this time was really hard to be patient because I was so excited about building. Left in my reach, we had been planning it for a while now, and we started on a Tuesday after school was over. We got like half of it done that day, but then we couldn’t work on it again for a week because my brother, sister, dad, and mom all had work or other commitments, so I had to wait a whole week just to work on it again. It was really hard to be patient this time though because I had been waiting to do this for a while. After a week finally passed, it seemed like a month, but now I could finish my work and I was so excited. A few days later we finally finished the walls, painted a blue and gold for U of M, and my loft was all we had left to do; we just had to put my bed in my loft, then it was ready to sleep in. I was so happy that we had finally finished my room and I could sleep in it, making the long wait completely worthwhile.
866	18797	7	3	One time that I was patient was when I was saving up to buy a game. The name of the game was Halo Reach. I had to wait several weeks until I could get it. Each week, I would put a little bit of my allowance into my savings jar, watching the total slowly grow. But I was patient by waiting the whole time and not asking my parents over and over again for the money or for them to buy it early. I focused on other games I already owned to pass the time. Finally, the day came when I had enough, and I went to the store to buy it myself. The feeling of finally playing it after such a long wait was incredibly rewarding and taught me the value of patience.
867	18798	7	3	"The little filly a few days after the older horses began to run, Sparkle, a small, anxious, chestnut foal saw her mother plowing a large oval and covering it with what looked like dust. ""What's mother doing, Mama?"" asked a very curious Sparkle. ""She's plowing."" replied Daisy, the young horses' caretaker. ""She's going to be in a race called the Kentucky Derby next year and that's how she will practice."" I want to race! ""hollered Sparkle excitedly ""Patience my darling, you're not even a full-grown filly! "" Daisy stated, conclusively. And so Sparkle waited patiently for weeks, watching from the fence. When she could, she ran the track at night under the moonlight. She counted her times and she got faster and stronger with each practice. Two years later Sparkle was the champion, a title she reached for three years in a row. ""Daisy was right! "" she claimed ""Patience is the key to success!"""
868	18799	7	3	“Did you buy it yet?” I yelled across the room. “I have not yet, let's get it ordered,” my dad said back to me. I was buying a scooter on the internet and it was being shipped from China. The website said the scooter will get here in five to eight business days. “Yes!” I yelled as I bought it, “Now all that’s left to do is wait.” The next morning I woke up at six am to catch the bus to school; during all my classes all I could think about was the scooter. Patience, I need patience, I thought. After school I would go to close country until five when my parents would pick me up. Five business days finally came. “I can't wait any more!” I yelled. After close country my mom drove me home and I sprinted to the mail box. “Darn it!” I said. “Oh yeah, the website tried to charge our credit card extra money so we had to cancel the order.” “I am sorry,” my mom said, “let's buy you a new one from a different store.” The new scooter finally arrives three business days later. “It’s about time,” I said with joy as I unwrapped the box.
869	18800	7	3	One time when I was at Cedar Point amusement park I had to wait about two hours to go on the Top Thrill Dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were waiting and waiting, watching the coaster shoot up and down the track. When we got to the front of the line I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the rollercoaster I said that I don’t want to go. So my dad asked if his son could get off the rollercoaster and they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go on it over and again. The initial fear was replaced by an incredible thrill. Even though it was a seventeen-second ride it was the best thing that I had ever waited for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted, and it was completely worth the long wait.
870	18801	7	3	"I had to be patient waiting to go to Disney World. It went through many months of planning and appointments. I was so excited and had to wait patiently through many school achievements and other activities respectively. On the days leading up to the trip, I would help with everything, making sure especially to finish my chores. My parents would tell me, ""You must be patient. We will get there."" I had to be patient. I did all my homework, and in the process, I worked hard to get a good grade. I watched the days pass on the calendar and did everything else I needed to in the meantime. Sitting on the plane finally felt so rewarding because such a vast wait was then over, and the vacation was everything I had hoped it would be."
871	18802	7	3	Do you know someone who is patient? I do; my mom is very patient with us kids. When I just blow my top, my mom is still cool and calm. All the time, my little brother makes me so mad that I can’t stand it, but she is barely ever like that. Even when my grandma died, she stayed cool and composed. Two of my aunts just broke down that week, but they are good now. Every day, things don’t make her very uptight. When my sister makes her mad, my sister always regrets it. I want to punch her when she makes mom mad because it wears off on me and she gets cranky. So as you can see, my mom keeps her patience so well, and that is a quality I truly admire.
872	18803	7	3	My friend was waiting for two hours to talk to my dad, who was busy fixing his motorcycle. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting patiently till my dad fixed it. I was wondering what the question was the entire time. He was sitting inside, watching TV and waiting for him to be finished. Then my dad was finally done, so my friend asked if we could ride the motorcycle. My dad said yes, and we were all happy. My friend was being very patient throughout the whole long wait, and it really paid off in the end.
873	18804	7	3	Being patient is a good thing because if you are, then you can handle some rough times in life. Patient people can manage by bringing something to do. They could wait there for three hours and not be heard complaining. There are some people that can’t wait there for three hours. There are some people that can’t wait there for ten minutes. These people get mad at that and they will just give up. But after all, of those people that can and can’t wait, people can’t just quit. Some people wait there for one hour and will blow up. And then there are people that can’t do it but they do it anyway. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you can’t handle the wait, and that is how you learn to be patient.
874	18805	7	3	“Dad, are we there yet?” I keep asking over and over again. “Not yet, but almost,” he replied. Today we are going to Adventure Park, and I am so excited! After I asked my dad when we would be there, about twenty minutes later we finally arrived at Adventure Park! The line to get our tickets was long but not too long. Once we got them, we went to look for a locker to put all of our stuff in! The line for that wasn’t long, so we did that fast! We were now all hungry, so we went to go eat! By the time we got into the restaurant, the lines to order were very long! Ok, so now that we are all done eating, it was time to ride some awesome rides! “Oh, man!” is what I kept saying when the lines to the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, ok, say I had to go change my clothes to go into the water park and change back or go to the restroom—man, these lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost done, and the park will be closing, my family and I went into the gift shop; we were in there for about thirty minutes walking around. When we were done and we were ready to check out, the checkout line wasn’t long at all! Finally, there was a line that wasn’t long! All that day I was a very patient girl, even with everything that went on throughout that long and exciting day.
875	18806	7	3	A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at the theme park on vacation. I was having a blast. My family didn’t come because they don’t like roller coasters. We decided to ride the Thunderbolt, and it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting, it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first, but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the Thunderbolt. We really wanted to ride it, so we waited patiently until the rain stopped. After another hour, most people had left, so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting two and a half hours for it, and we even went on it twice, which made the patience worthwhile.
876	18807	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was in second grade and I had to wait to play football till this year. I was patient because I waited for a long time without doing anything, simply watching the games from the sidelines and hoping for my turn to come. I never complained or gave up on my wish to join the team, even when the seasons seemed to pass so slowly. Finally, this year arrived, and I was able to sign up and play, which made all that waiting feel worthwhile. That experience taught me the value of patience.
877	18808	7	3	Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something you need in life. I’m going to tell you a little bit about being patient. First, patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need for when we go shopping, or when your in the car. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you don’t then you could get into an accident by rushing or making a hasty decision. Patience has many qualities. If you aren’t patient when you are some place then you are going to become annoying. When their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. Second, being patient is important. If you have kids and you're impatient, then your going to teach your kids to be impatient. That’s not a good thing for them to learn. As you can see I have told you as much as I can about patience and why it matters in our daily lives.
878	18809	7	3	A time when my parents were patient was when I wouldn’t eat my dinner. One night my dad made chop suey for dinner. I didn’t like chop suey at all! The smell of it really made me gag! But, my dad loves chop suey so he makes it all the time! We all sat down to eat. I ate a potato and my dad gave me whole scoop of chop suey. “I’m not gonna eat it,” I said. “I hate chop suey.” My dad sat patiently at the table waiting for me to eat what was on my plate. “Fine,” I said, “I’ll eat the meat out of it.” I took the fork and stirred the chop suey around looking for the meat. After I ate all the meat, I said, “Now I am done.” My dad laughed at my stubbornness. “Eat the vegetables out of it,” my dad said. “But no! I hate celery!” I whined. After a half hour of the war of wills my dad won. I really wanted to leave the table but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the chop suey and leaving the table. That was when my dad was very patient and showed me how to handle a difficult situation calmly.
879	18810	7	3	One time when I was being very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were suppose to be going to Disney adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn’t get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at eight like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said that’s ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready without complaining. So as we were walking out I noticed that my grandparent were caring suitcases and I said why do you guys carring suitcases my grandma and that we were going to spend the night in a hotel I so we would be even closer to Disney adventures. So she drove all of us back to our houses to get our things and one extra pair of clothes after that we were as our way to the hotel and ready to go to Disney adventure that next morning. Even though we were suppose to go earlier, our patience made the whole trip start off smoothly and happily.
880	18811	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when I went to Texas with my mom, dad, my sister and my grandma. My cousins live in Texas so we were going to visit them. We had to drive twelve hours in a small cobalt with five people. We had to be patient on the car ride there because we were all really exited and the space was cramped. When I first found out that we were going I was really happy and I knew I would have to be very patient during the long journey. We had to drive the hole day then get a motel to stay in. Then we had to drive till about noon and we were finally at my great aunts lake house, my my grandmas sister. It was so fun geting to see them again! But then came more patients on the trip home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home everyone of us was tired and tired of being in the car but we were glad we didn’t have to drive anothe hour home like my grandma. That was a time when I had to be patient, and it showed me that good things often require enduring a long wait.
881	18812	7	3	This is a story about a time I was patient. It was late at night and all of a sudden a wire from my braces popped out of place. It was sticking out of my mouth, poking the inside of my cheek, and there was nothing I could do about it. I had to wait for my mom to get home to help me. I was scared but I remained patient, carefully avoiding moving my tongue near the sharp end. I kept waiting calmly until my mom finally got there and we got the wires safely out. In the end, my patience paid off and the uncomfortable situation was resolved.
882	18813	7	3	A day when I had to be patient was on my birthday. I was waiting for my dad to give me some money so I could go to the store. I waited all day until six o'clock, and when he finally agreed, I got twenty dollars. It was worth being patient because if I had kept rushing him, he probably would have lowered the price and it would have been my fault. Another time I had to be patient was when I was waiting for my mother to pick me up from football practice. We had to wait for a while and I was the last one there. I stood under a tree when it started raining and lightning, so I couldn't put on my helmet as it would have conducted electricity. Being patient in these situations was important, as rushing would not have changed the outcome. In the future, if you are in a similar situation, just don't rush.
883	18814	7	3	What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something without getting upset or annoyed. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tried everything for four years, including begging, pleading, and even cleaning my room without being asked, but it still didn’t work. My mom said I had to be sixteen before I could get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her further, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do now is wait until soccer is finished and find a place, and she’ll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place in the end.
884	18815	7	3	Sometimes being patient is hard, but I’ve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I’ve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see all my presents, but there were none. My mom was just watching T.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, “Good morning.” All she said back was, “Good morning, why are you up this early?” I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing had happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, but nothing did. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until noon, just waiting for someone to say “happy birthday,” but yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until six pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient because I got a good party and now I’m patient every day.
885	18816	7	3	Last summer I went with some friends to the annual Christian rock festival. The festival is about Christian rock music. The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite Christian rock band, MercyMe. They played new songs and had a lot of amazing guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The part that made me patient was the long line that my friend Jake and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost stretched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long, the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front, the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave their lead singer, Bart, my lucky bracelet. That was the time I was patient and it led to a memorable experience.
886	18817	7	3	One time there were two twin chipmunks, their names were @PERSON1 and A.J. @PERSON1 always had patience, but A.J. not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up their camping gear and headed farther into the woods. It was around dusk when they reached where they wanted to be, a small clearing near a stream. So they tried to build a fire. A.J. started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how their mom and dad had taught them. As I said in the first part, A.J. has no patience so he kept on trying but after a while he stopped; he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldn’t start, so he would give up and try again a different way. So @PERSON1 tried, and in just @NUM1 minute he got it started with a steady flame. A.J. didn’t care, he got the acorns and started cooking. But every time he’d only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds, so they were always cold and hard. He tried and tried, getting more frustrated with each attempt, and finally he just stopped. Well, it took @PERSON1 a full @NUM2 minutes to roast them perfectly. A.J. was really mad now, his face flushed with anger, so they went to bed without another word. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning, the sun was just rising, and he found A.J. cooking breakfast over a new, carefully built fire. A.J. had finally learned to be patient, understanding that good things come to those who wait.
887	18818	7	3	My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine, a small piece of paper that felt like a golden key. I was going to see three days of @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined internally, but only in my head, a constant, excited murmur. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay, having settled into a state of nervous anticipation. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow; it was a blur of school and waiting. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called Flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled by, each hour feeling longer than the last. I wanted to explode with excitement, my legs jiggling uncontrollably. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dad's car at @NUM2. Cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1, the music fueling my excitement. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums. We passed a limo with one window open, and I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1, a moment that made everything feel real. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long, winding line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left, taking a deep breath. The enormous tunnels the lines were in were gray and drab. We had to walk for what felt like a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line snaked along, made up of what seemed like snails, but before I knew it, the line moved and I was in, the noise of the crowd washing over me. I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience, and ready for the show to begin.
888	18819	7	3	One day I was being really patient. I was babysitting and it was going great until the kids started fighting! It was my two little brothers, of course. They were hitting, kicking, and the youngest one was even biting; so I told them to stop in a firm but calm voice. They did for a while, playing quietly with their blocks, and then started again over a toy truck. So I went back to their room, the floor littered with toys, and told them to stop again, explaining they needed to share. So they stopped for good, until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said, repeating every word in a silly voice. So I said stop or you’ll go to your room, pointing to the door for emphasis. So he stopped, his lower lip trembling slightly, and everybody was good for the rest of the night, eventually settling down to watch a movie. They were all quiet and well-behaved until mom and dad got home, and now that's a whole different story. So that's the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters, and it felt like a real accomplishment.
889	18820	7	3	A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game, a promise that filled me with excitement. So the next day when I woke up, I woke up far too early, the sun barely up. My aunt never told me what time she was coming, which was frustrating. So I got ready at @NUM1 am, putting on my favorite jersey. So at @NUM2 am I called her, my fingers tapping nervously on the phone, but she didn’t answer. So then I just was watching TV and playing my game, trying to distract myself. Then around @NUM3 pm my aunt called back saying she had to go to the store first. So now my frustration started to build up, a tightness in my chest. I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you going and how long you're gonna be gone, but I was trying to be patient and not pester her. Now at @NUM4 my mom said lets go! Now I was really getting mad because I was not expecting to leave with my mom, my plans feeling up in the air. So me and my mom got home at around @NUM5 pm from running her errands. Now I was real angry because she had not even called since we was gone, and I thought I had missed my chance. So I called her, my voice a little shaky, and she said she was comin' down the street right at that moment. I was so happy, my frustration melting away instantly. So later on that day I had fun with my cousins and aunt at the game, and the wait was worth it.
890	18821	7	3	“@CAPS1, when @CAPS5 we open presents?” I asked, barely able to stand still. “@CAPS2 we get back from church,” she replied in her calm mother-voice. It was our typical @DATE1 schedule: make @CAPS3 Eve dinner all day, go to the @CAPS3 Eve service, have grandparents for dinner, than all the kids get to open one present than go to bed for about one hour, get up, and open more presents. “Amen,” our pastor concluded the service. “@CAPS5 we go now, @CAPS1?” I blubbered, tugging on her sleeve. “@CAPS6,” she said firmly, taking my hand. @CAPS8 we ate dinner, a delicious meal I could hardly taste. I felt like I had ants in my pants, I was so excited, my knees bouncing under the table. Time seemed to go by so slow; I felt like I was @NUM1 years old before my grandparents finally finished their coffee and left. Finally we were all gathered around the @CAPS3 tree, its lights twinkling. @CAPS8 I was about to open my present, my hands trembling with anticipation. All it was was a sleeping bag, soft and blue. Then my dad said, “you @CAPS5 all sleep on the floor in @LOCATION1 room, but be sure you go to bed.” @CAPS8 I was laying on the floor in my new sleeping bag, while my sister was sound asleep beside me. I was thinking, I wonder what I’ll get for @CAPS3, imagining all the possibilities. I eventually fell asleep, my dreams full of wrapped boxes. The next morning at @NUM2, I jumped out of bed, woke my sister up with a shake, and ran into my parents room to wake them up, unable to contain myself any longer. I was thinking finally we get to open all the presents. That was a time where I had to be very patient, but it was all paid off in the end with a wonderful Christmas morning.
891	18822	7	3	Patience is about waiting and having to wait for the stuff you want, like if I want anything, patience is that you have to wait before you get it. So patience, it means that you have to wait in a good manner, which involves staying calm and not complaining while you wait for your turn or for something you desire. It is about enduring a delay without becoming upset or frustrated, understanding that good things often take time to arrive. This virtue helps us to handle situations gracefully when we cannot immediately get what we wish for, teaching us the value of self-control and peaceful expectation. Ultimately, practicing patience leads to a more peaceful and satisfying experience when we finally receive what we have been waiting for.
892	18823	7	3	Once I was taking a test and it was really long. I was done early, and my friend and I waited a long time for the others to finish. They gave us two and a half hours for the test, but I finished with an hour and a half to spare. My friend finished within five minutes of me, so we both had a lot of time left. I read a book but finished it quickly, and then I had to wait another hour to actually do something else. It is important to remember to bring something to do while you are being patient, as it makes the waiting much easier. If you have nothing to do, you should just wait quietly without disturbing others. Patience is a good quality that can be cultivated through such experiences, and it can be used by waiting calmly for something or for someone, which is a valuable skill in life.
893	18824	7	3	One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I wanted, and they asked me how much it was. I said that I did not know how much it cost, so my dad said that we would go to the store and see the price. When we got to there, we found out that it was quite expensive, and I asked if I could buy it. He said maybe, but after a while I started begging for it. He still said no firmly. When I went home, I went to sleep, and the next morning I was at home watching television. I saw a commercial about the game, and it said that the game was still available. Later, when we went to the mall, I saw that the price had been reduced, and so I finally got to buy it after waiting and being patient for a while, which felt very rewarding in the end.
894	18825	7	3	Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was very patient one day when I was ten years old, and it was all because of a piece of popcorn. A small little popcorn kernel got caught in my throat, and that was an agonizing day, but I was very patient throughout the ordeal. One day, about two years ago when I was ten years old, I swallowed a popcorn kernel after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box and then throwing the box away. Well, right as soon as I had walked out the door and eaten my popcorn piece, it started to bother me. My mom and I walked into the Target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn kernel stuck in my throat. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty I was, but she said she only had a credit card with her at that moment. That meant she could buy her things but she could not buy a pop from the food court, as it required cash. I understood the situation, so I just tried not to think about my discomfort, which was very hard to do. Soon we pulled up to our next errand, the bank, because my mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructor. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn kernel and my lack of something to drink was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away, not just a few, but I did not argue with her. The kernel and my thirst were starting to get to me badly. It felt like it had been three hours, but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water immediately. I ran, opened the fridge, opened a bottle of water, and chugged the whole thing down quickly. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things, and then I drank more water with a smile, feeling much better. In conclusion, we all learn to be patient sometimes, and I was patient to get home and drink some water, which ultimately relieved my discomfort and taught me the value of enduring a wait calmly.
895	18826	7	3	There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the one I can remember the most was when I was at the airport with my family. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal for our flight to our vacation destination. We had been waiting about thirty minutes when we heard an announcement over the loudspeaker. They said something had gone wrong with the plane but it should be fixed in about an hour. We eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the important parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would function properly. An hour of waiting sounded okay at first, but then there was another announcement that changed things. They said they were sorry, but they could not get the part right away, so the wait would be a minimum of three more hours. That sounded worse, but I kept calm and tried to wait patiently. My mom, however, was freaking out a little bit. Three hours had passed, then four hours, and then even more time went by slowly. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power, so I was just fiddling with my fingers with nothing else to do. Then we heard another update that the part could not be obtained until the next morning. A big groan swept across the entire terminal from all the waiting passengers. But luckily, the airline provided us with a free night at a hotel until the flight was ready. The wait was exhausting and tested everyone's limits, but we all had patience, so we got through the difficult situation together without too much trouble.
896	18827	7	3	A couple of days ago when I was at cheer practice, a lot of drama was going around our team. It was fifteen days before the competition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom routine in our second formation wasn't in the diagonal line we were supposed to be in, and we weren't getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us farther down the mat, so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1 was yelling at the side I’m on for not getting to the kickline in time, even though she's the one pushing us farther down so we can't get there. Then she started yelling at @PERSON1, saying it was all her fault, so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, “@LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything, you aren't perfect at everything either, and you're the ones pushing us over so we can't get to the kickline in time.” @LOCATION1 didn't know what to say, but she said, “@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isn't true,” even though you could tell that she knew it was true because the next time we did the kickline she didn’t move closer to the center; she moved farther away, and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple of seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends; they still are friends, just not best friends, and that moment showed true team spirit.
897	18829	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go but she wasn’t ready. She had to get her hair done and some clothes on. I waited patiently and didn’t say nothing, even though I didn’t want to wait, I did because I wanted us to go outside together. I walked out the door quietly, then my sister yelled, “I want to go, wait!” So I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes; she went upstairs and found some. She put her clothes on, then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in the corner. So we were about to walk out and I said, “Girl, what’s wrong with your hair?” She felt her head and said, “Oh, I forgot.” So we went back in the house and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail and it wouldn’t fit. So I let her try to do something herself, and she couldn’t. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we finally went outside. That’s a time when I waited patiently on my sister, and it felt good to help her out.
898	18830	7	3	When I was getting ready to leave my uncle's ranch, I was waiting patiently for my dad to get back so he could help my brother put the @NUM1 on to the trailer. It had been @NUM2 hours and my dad had not come back yet. I was having a difficult time taking my @NUM3 off the trailer because it was too heavy, and my dad was still riding his @NUM3. The sun was getting lower, and I was starting to feel a little frustrated but tried to remain calm. When my dad finally got back, my brother immediately went to go ride his @NUM3, leaving me with the heavy work. I was having a very difficult time trying to get everything packed and leave, but finally my mom and sister decided they wanted to leave too, so they finally helped me, and we managed to get everything loaded up together.
899	18831	7	3	It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I were going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was raining and only one of the rides was open. So we sat around under an awning till all of them were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on one. It was called the Freak Out. There were lights flickering and loud music blaring from it. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said, “Why did you get out of line?” “I am scared,” I replied. “I want to go on it though,” he said. “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I asked. We waited for an hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said, “@CAPS1 we go on the ride now?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1,” I said, my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said, “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with,” I finally agreed. @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion, my cousin is the nicest for waiting so patiently for me. On the up side, I love that ride now and I'm glad he helped me face my fear.
900	18832	7	3	"Have you ever been patient before? Well I have. I was sitting there in a nice warm and cozy seat, exhausted and dozing off, waiting for them to call my name, @PERSON1. It kept going through my mind: @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened, so I just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me reading an Avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silent orthodontist office. I kept asking myself things like, I wonder what they're gonna do today, I wonder if I'll get my expander off, or what about my top braces. Then I started to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room. Finally, a girl walked out and the assistant called, ""@CAPS1"" I was excited and nervous at the same time, but I was proud because I had sat there the whole time patiently without complaining, and it made the eventual call feel like a real achievement."
901	18833	7	3	"Patience was on our way to the big city, to go to a very special baseball game. Can you guess what the game was? It was the Detroit Tigers, at the Comerica Park stadium. We were so excited, it was the first time we had ever been in Detroit. ""How much longer till we get there?"" I asked. ""About an hour, why?"" my mom replied. ""Because it's so boring sitting here for four hours straight."" ""I know, but you have to be patient."" ""Okay,"" I thought in my head. ""I wonder how I could be patient for that long?"" I just thought for a moment. Then a minute, then boom! I was out cold; for two hours I slept. Then I woke up just as we hit traffic. I asked, ""Are we there yet?"" ""I hope so,"" my dad said. So I sat there waiting patiently. About ten minutes later I asked if we could turn on the radio. ""Sure,"" my mom said. We sat there for about another twenty minutes. Then we finally started moving, and I tried hardest not to be annoying, thinking about what I was going to do when I got to the game. I was thinking maybe I’ll get a bit expensive, but by the time I thought anything else I heard, ""We're here!"" ""Yay!"" I screamed. So we got out of the car and walked about a quarter of a mile to the ticket booth. As we were walking up I thought, ""I guess all it does take is patience."""
902	18834	7	3	Two weeks ago me and my family went to Six Flags for Fright Fest. The lines were going to be long and I would never be patient, I hate being patient. We went on Gotham City first; the line was only ten minutes. Then we went on the Superman, that one was a little longer. Me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the Riddler. Then we rode the wooden rollercoaster, the one that goes off the track a lot; we waited fifteen minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we saw the coaster, but people with these Flash Passes kept coming. The Flash Pass takes you to the front of the line. When we finally got to the front of the line my patience was gone. The roller coaster went off the track. It was a two-mile coaster but a fun one. That is the time I was patient.
903	18835	7	3	One day, last year I had to be really patient. My mom had told the family that we would be going to Six Flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldn’t wait, so I asked her when and she said she didn’t know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a Saturday because she works during the week. I was just happy that school was finally out so I didn’t have to worry about homework. So I waited until Wednesday and then asked my mom if we could go that Saturday. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldn’t randomly go one Saturday. That week I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure she didn’t have any meetings or projects for the coming Saturday. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do, so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free Saturday she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because that’s better than nothing. Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for Six Flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about fifty dollars saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been.
904	18836	7	3	Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mall with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the Apple store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! Afterward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, while my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent three hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home, feeling happy and content after a fun, patient day.
905	18837	7	3	"One time when my brother was patient was when my dad and I taught him how to pitch. My brother easily developed a nice windup and delivery but the arm angle was off. But this didn’t stop him. My dad asked him if he wanted to stop but my brother said, ""No!"" As time went on, my brother started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing a seventy-mile-per-hour fastball at a catcher. On days that he’s inaccurate he doesn’t give up; he keeps trying and doesn’t whine. My brother is now the number two starter in the rotation, thanks to his own patience and determination."
906	18839	7	3	"""Be patient! It will be here soon, don’t worry,"" Mom said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. Well, over these few days (which feels like centuries) I have not been this so-called ""patient"" person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didn’t come in the mail. I’ve been waiting and waiting but the wait is taking too long! For the fifth time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come on Tuesday but it didn’t. ""I’ve been sitting here since ten o’clock; where is the mail truck!"" I scream. Then I glance at the clock; it's only ten fifteen. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! ""It's coming,"" I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white postal service truck wander along the street. (Finally, that’s it!) I rush to the window to gaze. Nope, it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps. ""No!"" I sob in agony, ""why does this feeling consume me like this?"" I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. ""It's here! It's here!"" I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally, my patience was rewarded."
907	18840	7	3	"One of the many times I was patient was when my mother, my sister, and I went to a restaurant. We ordered our food and found a table. We were sitting there waiting for the food, and the minutes seemed to stretch. I asked my mother, ""How much longer is it going to take?"" My mother said, ""You have to be patient and wait."" I fidgeted in my seat, watching other tables get their meals. And then a little while after, our food was done and the waiter brought it to our table. The hot, delicious smell filled the air, and I took my first bite. It was totally worth the wait."
908	18841	7	3	About three or four times I was patient; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother went shopping for me. I had to be patient and wait for her to come back with my presents, watching the door for any sign of her return. The other time was when I was seven and it was Christmas day and I was up super early and ready. I had to be patient, once again, and wait for my dad to wake up so I could open my presents, listening for any sound from his room. Then the other time was when my friend had to do something, so I had to be patient again. I waited till he got back, passing the time by looking at my phone. This will conclude my paper on being patient.
909	18842	7	3	"The time I was patient was when we went to the beach. ""Mom!"" I exclaimed. ""Let's go, I want to leave; I'm packed and ready to go."" My mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beautiful morning in July and it was also my step dad's birthday. ""Honey, you need to be patient, okay, we have a long drive. Do you have everything you need?"" Mom got me thinking. I had to get coloring materials, the portable DVD player, etc. I had my swimsuit and a towel; what else did I need until my stomach growled? It sounded like a bear protecting its cubs, fierce and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in my head, food—that's what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips: salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion (my favorite), and jalapeno cheddar (yum). Now I have everything, I thought, ""let's go."" I told my mom and again I rushed out the door. ""Got the address?"" asked my father. ""Yes, Dad, I got it."" Later, when we started to go, my sister fell asleep. She was sleeping like a rock the whole way there, although I don't think rocks snore. After two hours of being awake in the car, I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitement was rushing so fast I could feel it; then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way, but I was marked impossible. Finally, my step father yelled, ""Wake up!!"" I was so tired when I woke up. ""Are we there yet?"" was the first thing that came out of my mouth. ""Yeah,"" he said, and, of course, the first thing I did was jump up and out of the car! ""Stop!"" my mother shouted. I paused as if I was a character in a video game and the player pressed pause. ""Come take in some of the bags."" ""Okay,"" I said with a scowl on my face. ""Remember, you have to be patient,"" Mom said. As I took in the bag, there it was: the condo of my dreams, and the first thing I did was sleep."
910	18843	7	3	"Being patient isn’t always that easy. In fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with two rude, screaming, and crying kids for five hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great grandmother in the city with my grandpa. My grandpa is fun to talk to, but later I found out my two younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my iPod and a book, but my cousins brought loud, noisy, and flashy toys they bought just for the ride. As we started heading for the city, I turned my iPod on and found out it only had ten percent battery left. Halfway there I was almost dead of boredom, and the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep, I decided to join them. Whack! I awoke to a slobbery slap to the face. ""We’re here!"" my cousin announced. Finally, I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my grandmother, it was about three hours later and my cousins were all asleep again, and I knew it was going to be a nice, quiet ride home."
911	18844	7	3	There was a day when I was patient and I was so nice, and this girl was so in a hurry she was getting on my nerves because she kept pushing me and hitting me. So I just let her in front of me and we were in the lunch line and a lot of people were ready for lunch. The lunch lady said to stop pushing her. Then we were in class and so I raised my hand and she said to be patient. I said I am patient so shut up, so shut up please, but she didn’t shut up. So I had another time and the teacher called on me, so she got mad at me. It was a long and frustrating day, but in the end, I managed to keep my composure through it all.
912	18845	7	3	I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my mom if she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma and my grandma talks a lot. It was so agonizing. For example, I kept pacing back and forth in the kitchen, but then I just sat down on a chair and tried to wait quietly. After an hour of patience, my mom and grandma finally said goodbye and hung up the phone and I finally got my breakfast. The wait felt endless, but my patience was rewarded with a warm meal.
913	18847	7	3	"One summer day, it was about ten o'clock. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready; I don’t know what we was getting ready for, but we got on the road as soon as we could. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the highway. I woke up from a big screech of the brakes and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars. ""Where are we?"" I asked. ""Six Flags,"" said my brother. I could hear impatient people all around me. They were honking, screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seemed like we were moving faster than some of the other people, and we was one of the first people to get in first. That was the most impatient group of people I’d ever seen, and I was glad we finally made it inside."
914	18848	7	3	Please stop her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were seven of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldn't even move our arms; I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was five o'clock in the morning and I saw a big sign that read welcome to Florida. So at that point we only had a hour or so left and I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination Key West. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tried my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didn't care because I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of eighty-five degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didn't even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But now I know I have the patience to go home, and the memory of the beach will make the return trip easier.
915	18849	7	3	A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part one of the test and I was very anxious and I wanted to get up and move around, but we were taking the state exam so I could not. Instead I entertained myself in any way I could such as pretending to sing, writing songs in my head repeatedly, and even twiddling my thumbs! So finally the teacher let us get up and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends so I just talked to them. Somehow we got into talking about dungeons and dragons; they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. Anyway I kept trying to talk but I keep getting interrupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. Finally it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch so I never did get to say what mine was. This is a time when I was patient, and I learned that sometimes waiting calmly is the only thing you can do.
916	18851	7	3	Have you ever got annoyed because someone kept saying be patient? I have and I'm gonna tell you about the time I was patient. One time I was on my way to visit my grandparents, the plane ride wasn’t as bad as what I'm gonna tell you. When we got to the border crossing we had to pass through the immigration border; it was hot!!! I think the temperature hit one hundred degrees? We had to wait in this small, cramped room with about fifty people, and they had no A.C. All of us were waiting for the bus to come, and after two long hours a bus finally arrived. We were getting on when about ten people came barging in front, so we missed that bus. Then we waited again for a bus, and after another three hours a bus arrives again. We were trying to get on, but then again we got pushed out of the way. So we missed that bus; I was so frustrated and so did my family. Another thing I got frustrated at was there were thousands of flies all over the place, buzzing around incessantly. So we waited, and after two more hours a bus arrives, but my little brother was in the bathroom, so we missed that bus. My mom was telling me to calm down and be patient, so I stayed patient until the fourth bus came. We got on, but the bus didn’t go where we were supposed to, so we had to go back to the same place we were in, but again my mom says stay patient. One of the officers over at the place saw how long we were waiting, and once the next bus arrived after another four hours and thirty minutes, he held everybody else up, let me and my family get on, and told the driver “take them by there self,” so we had the bus to our selves, and you know what, it was all worth it in the end.
917	18852	7	3	There was a time when I had to wait on handling my personal business. My sisters and I came into the house and one of them went to handle their personal business while I was being patient, trying not to yell and knock hard on the door, telling her to hurry up in whatever they were doing. By the way, my older sister is fourteen years old and my younger sister is ten years old. I had waited and waited, being very patient not to be laying on the door, banging on it, even though I really had to handle my personal business. It felt good to be very patient around them, who are non-patient people, because think about it: when you really have to handle something in the bathroom or restroom, people will think you are a rushing person instead of a patient one. Anyway, they will talk about it to anyone that he or she knows as a bad thing when they are just talking about anything. In the end, this was not a time where we wait to be patient for others; it was a time for me to practice my own patience.
918	18853	7	3	Patience may seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for a package to arrive, etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old, has patience just like I did when I was in fifth grade. Each day I wondered if it was a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in fifth grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally—a little sister. After three long years, that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it, my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for China. There we would see the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and Tiananmen Square, not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for two more weeks, and then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn’t believe we were the first ones to receive our gift from China. Big moment! The moment my mom tried to take her she started wailing, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at a local restaurant. My dad ordered a milkshake and he let her try some of it; that was also a big moment. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollercoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad’s dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience; the question is, “will you use it?”
919	18854	7	3	"A person I know that's patient is my dad; he is very patient. Like one time we were in the drive-through at McDonald's, and soon as we pulled up, the lady was like ""just one second"" and she left. We were sitting there for five whole minutes, and I saw people getting out of their cars and going in the restaurant to order their food. But my dad, he just sat there, adjusting the air conditioning, until the lady came back. I was so mad that the lady made us sit there for another five minutes, but then I was happy cause I got my food. Then when we were pulling off, my dad said, ""See, that's why patience got us our hot food,"" my double cheeseburger and my large iced tea with chocolate chip cookies. My dad taught me a valuable lesson that day about staying calm and not letting frustration lead to nothing but drama and not happiness."
920	18855	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride the roller coaster at an amusement park. First, the park was fun, but waiting in line took patience; we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was too long of a wait. I had to stay patient if I wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was excited to ride the roller coaster, so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting in front, but it was worth it when I got to ride. The feeling of the wind and the speed made the wait completely worthwhile. As you can see, sometimes it's good to stay patient, but when you get to do something fun, it's worth it. When people push you, you just had to stay calm and be patient, and you will eventually get your turn.
921	18856	7	3	I’m always patient. I’m really patient until my birthday, and then when I get presents I don’t need to be patient anymore because I wait a whole year for presents and then I wait for @CAPS1 because it’s only like a month away from my birthday. And this year I’m being patient until @CAPS1 because I’ve already know what I’m getting. But that’s what I’m patient for, just about nothing else I’m patient for, like waiting for dinner or for a show to start. My patience is saved for those two big days, and the rest of the time I just want things to happen right away. It’s a special kind of waiting, reserved only for the best rewards.
922	18857	7	3	Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the final book of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2,” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearable heat getting to me because when the door slammed shut @CAPS10 argued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast minutes. I didn’t believe her, but we climbed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every stoplight. It was like the lights were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with no way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on my right came the book store and my jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stopped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “No way!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line.” It was like the whole town was in on making me as annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop. I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night. “@NUM1 minutes till midnight,” my mom explained to me. “That’s impossible,” I told her. “You can make it.” She was right, @NUM1 minutes wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffee coming from inside and listened to the hum of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minutes would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. Click the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen? How is it going to end? My mind was full of questions. “So, was that wait really that bad?” my mom asked. “I guess not,” I answered sheepishly. “Being patient paid off,” my mom lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile a minute. I learned being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patience is understanding and now that I’m a little better at being patient, things will be a lot better.
923	18858	7	3	One time I was patient because the teacher had to tell me something. So I waited by the door but then she had to go to the office so I had to wait some more, just standing there quietly. When the teacher came back she told me thanks for being patient and gave me a sticker. Patience really means you can wait without getting upset. Some kids don’t be patient; they get so mad for example, there was @NUM1 kids in one group we were playing a game and they would get so mad because they didn’t get called on a lot. But the game was random; you pick a stick and whoever’s stick it was went. So being patient means you have to be able to wait for your turn without getting angry, understanding that everyone will get a chance eventually.
924	18859	7	3	Patience is something or someone who likes waiting for someone or something. Patience is part of life. I sometimes don’t have patience but I should have patience, because without patience you will get nothing, because something in life you have to wait for. Good things often take time to arrive, and if you rush, you might miss them. That is why you should have patience, to receive the good things that come to those who can wait calmly and without complaint. It is a valuable quality that makes life smoother and more peaceful for everyone.
925	18860	7	3	“Let’s go!”, I yelled while running to the entrance of the huge theme park. “Wait a minute, you got to wait for your friend”, my mom said. As I stopped to wait for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and his brother @PERSON2, I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park. “Let’s go to the top roller coaster first!”, I said excitedly. “Okay, we can go on it, but me and @PERSON1 are staying in the back”, my mom said. “Great, because me and @PERSON3 are going in the front row!”, @PERSON2 yelled. As we started to walk to the line it said that it would be a @NUM1 minute wait for us to go. After we got in line I thought to myself, wow this is a long line, looking at all the people ahead of us. It wasn’t that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. “Click!”, the belt buckle sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. “Woo!”, everybody said when we took off. After that fun ride, I told myself I can be patient when I need to be, because the reward was definitely worth the wait.
926	18861	7	3	"@PERSON2 and I went to the store. @CAPS1 was picking up some marshmallows and chocolate to make s'mores. @CAPS1 was walking down aisle six when @CAPS1 came upon a huge bunch of people looking to buy stuff for s'mores. So @PERSON2 and I went in the line. @CAPS1 sat there for at least fifty minutes waiting for marshmallows and chocolate; but @CAPS1 came out with two marshmallows and two chocolate packs. I asked her, ""@PERSON2, why do you have two!"" @CAPS1 said that when she waited they were getting rid of them so they gave her two for the price of one. I smiled and we thanked her! When we went back to the car we told @CAPS2, our other sister ""@PERSON1"", that we got two. @NUM1 said something, and @CAPS2 sister snickered. We went back into @PERSON2’s car and put the bag in the trunk where one other grocery bag was, and then took off. We got home and @PERSON1 ate three, I ate two, and @PERSON2 ate five. @CAPS1 had watched us. Thank you."
927	18862	7	3	Today I’m going to write about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend's name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, then I came back an hour later and she was still there; she is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On tests, like the E.A.P, she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely, ha ha, and her last name is @CAPS2. At the @ORGANIZATION1 she doesn’t get upset in a long line for a corn dog. Now I’m starting to think that @CAPS1 enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn’t mind waiting for me when I have to do something, which is a wonderful quality in a friend.
928	18863	7	3	Patience is understanding and tolerance; it endures difficulties without complaining. I will tell you about a time when I was patient. “I’m gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wall,” @CAPS1 said. “You don’t buy me this?” @CAPS2 yelled. That is an example of blackmail, one of the many things you have to be patient with in your life. @CAPS2 is a six-year-old girl that I babysit. One day she was at my house and we were playing a game that involved kicking a shoe into a wall. When it was my turn, I kicked the shoe into the wall, literally. My mom came home and I told her the boys did that; of course, she believed me. But the one thing I had to deal with was that there was a witness, the six-year-old that can’t keep a secret. I told her not to tell my mom because if she did, I would get in big trouble and she would not be able to come over anymore. We went to the store and she discovered the glory of blackmail; she said she would tell my mom if I didn’t buy her ice cream. It was a frustrating day. I refused to buy her ice cream, so she told my mom, but my mom didn’t care.
929	18864	7	3	Applause filled the building after the first dance ended. I was backstage with my dance team going over our routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crowded, and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, but I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and the recital was at least five hours long. “@CAPS1, how many more dances?” and “what dance are we on?” was what everyone had on their mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on: excited, bored, and nervous. Then finally it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience, and it was worth the wait.
930	18865	7	3	One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called Modern; if you don’t know what that is, I’ll tell you. Well, Modern is a place I love. It has everything I love: a skate park, money, and trendy stuff. I went there with my mom; I told her she didn’t have to stay but she insisted on staying. So she stayed and watched me while I skated for @NUM1 hour; she cheered me on and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met, and I was very grateful for her company that day.
931	18868	7	3	Being patient is a great trait to have. When you are patient you are respected by others. That is why I have alot of respect for my teacher, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very patient person. If you didn’t understand something she would work through it with you until you understood completely. Even if it took a couple of weeks. One time she was teaching us how to add negative numbers and I didn’t understand and she worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. “Class today we are going to add negative numbers,” the teacher announced. This is going to be a breeze, I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and my teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When my teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers I was already lost. “Here are some sample problems that everyone needs to try,” said my teacher. A few minutes later she went to every student and checked their answers. When she got to me she had a worried expression on her face. “Is everything all right? You didn’t do your sample problems,” she asked me. “I don't understand this,” I replied. My teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said, “come see me after class.” So I waited until the end of the day and then went to see her. “I noticed you were having trouble with math today,” said my teacher. “Well, we're gonna fix that.” My teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in simple steps. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it I finally began to pick it up. Ten minutes later I was doing it correctly. “You can go now,” said my teacher. “You now understand it better than the other students.” “Thanks for being so patient with me,” I said before I left. My teacher just smiled. That was a time when my teacher was very patient with me. And I am glad that she was, because it helped me learn.
932	18870	7	3	Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of the soccer refs blowing their whistle for subs. I was playing defense. The coach was calling my name to take me off. When I got off the field I got my water bottle and sat on the bench, waiting to be subbed back in. I waited and waited until finally I asked my coach if I could go in. His response was, “You just got off.” In my mind I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in, I got on the field and realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subbed out again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patience, but I stayed calm. I asked my coach again if I could go back in, and he said sure. When the game was over I realized why my coach had benched me for so much of the game; it was because he likes the @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This is a time I was patient, even when it was difficult.
933	18871	7	3	This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I hadn’t had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient, trusting that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes soon. I know that when my mom has some money, and I need something new, she gets it for me. I was waiting patiently for my mom to return home. I had confidence that my mom would buy me the shoes. I sat by the window, watching for her. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes. I was very happy that I had waited so patiently for her.
934	18872	7	3	"Real @CAPS3 was one of the fastest runners in @LOCATION1. No one could catch him, beat him in a race, or even sneak up on him. This made him very impatient. Even when his friends and family spoke to him, this is what they pleaded, like to him. ""@CAPS1... @CAPS2... @CAPS3... @CAPS4... are... you... doing?"" they would say slowly. @CAPS3 was furious with the fact that no one was as fast as he was. So he ran away. He ran as fast as possible. It only took him @NUM1 minutes and he was already in @LOCATION2. In @LOCATION2, he saw that people didn't walk as fast as he could. But that didn't help when he tried to talk to them. He asked, ""For sure, where can I find nement @CAPS6?"" The @CAPS7 responded slowly. ""@CAPS8... ch... first... eh... you... turn... eh... best... ch."" @CAPS3 screamed; he had to believe that no one was as fast as he was. So he just had to be patient and learn to wait for others."
935	18873	7	3	Ah, patience. I know a lot of people have trouble being patient, so let me tell you a story about me being patient. I remember last year when I was @NUM1, my @CAPS1 went on a trip up @CAPS2 to go fishing for a week. It was a two hour drive straight, and I was really excited. My @CAPS1 left at exactly six that morning. I was happier than a lark to go on this trip as my @CAPS1 hit the highway. I was ready to get out, I was so darn excited. My dad said, “don’t worry bud, we will get there soon, let's calm down okay buddy.” I was quiet the rest of the way there, just waiting to see what our camp site looked like, waiting patiently. My @CAPS1 finally got there, and that was when I learned to be patient, and it was worth the wait.
936	18874	7	3	@PERSON1 is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and he was waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. He was feeling quite desperate but @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. @PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @PERSON1 was a head of six people that were all doin the pee-pee dance. He learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him, one by one. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 finally entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor near the sink. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it and put it safely in his pocket. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes, and he left the store feeling very pleased with himself.
937	18875	7	3	One time I was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile. Since itís a relay one person goes to run a mile, then the second person goes once the first person I done, after that the third person goes after the second person is done with his mile, then finally after the third person went I got to go run a mile because I was the fastest at running a mile. I watched my friends run their laps, cheering them on from the sidelines. Since I had to wait until the very end I had to have patience to wait and then finally go when it was my turn to run, and I gave it my all on the track.
938	18876	7	3	Patience not all of us have it. It is hard to learn theme but even harder to master theme. It requires a calm mind and a steady heart, even when things are frustrating. You must practice it in small moments every single day. It is all ways a good time to use your patience, whether you are in a long line or listening to a friend, and doing so will make life much smoother.
939	18877	7	3	When I went to the @CAPS1 conly @ORGANIZATION2 for youth group at my church I took some o my friend. In the maze we had to go as a group of @CAPS2 & me, my dad, @PERSON1, & @CAPS3 went in one group @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 in the group be hind us. It was dark and spooky inside the corn stalks. Half way thru the @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2 there was a guy casing us with a chain saw & then @PERSON1 smacked my glass of my face so we had to stop that @ORGANIZATION2 of the @ORGANIZATION2 so we could find them & just before we found them my friends in the @CAPS6 group came & had to wait @NUM1 minutes wich seemed long. They stood there anxiously, hearing the chainsaw roar in the distance. So they didnít get chance to get chaced by the guy with the chainsaw, which was a real shame for them.
940	18878	7	3	My story about being patient is the time I was I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes to get on the, ì@CAPS1 of @CAPS2î which is this really cool ride. The line was long and winding through the theme park. First thing I did in line was to try to talk the people because I knew I would be in line for a while. I said ìhiî to the couple in front of me and then we talk for a while and it turns out that they had come down south from @PERSON1, @LOCATION1 which is really close to @LOCATION2 where I live and it seemed so wierd being in @LOCATION3 and meeting people who lived right across our town, then time seemed to fly by because before I knew it we were getting strapped in our seats and away we goooooo, screaming with delight as the ride began.
941	18879	7	3	You have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don’t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant, able to handle delays without getting upset. The opposite of this is probably having a temper, or having a very short time before you get truly angry. I believe having patience in life is incredibly important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots of it to figure things out. I related life to sports, because I am a fairly good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my receiver drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me when I was learning. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other to succeed. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much further than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, “It's okay, don’t do it again.” Make sure that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don’t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concentrate on winning the next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtues a person can have, helping us through daily challenges and long-term goals.
942	18880	7	3	"Have you ever been patient or been told you're patient? Patience is a seven year old girl who is always told how patient she is, and this is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day Patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in Juancey, so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It took her mom two weeks to get everything ready; she had the amusement park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they were going to stay at for the weekend. The whole time Patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her to an amusement park. When they got to the hotel, Patience's mom had to get the room key, get to their room, unpack, and get dressed to go. The whole time Patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time Patience did not complain. They finally got their tickets and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that too, and Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ""ok"" and they waited for an hour until they got to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had a tremendous amount of fun. That is Patience's story of being patient, and I hope you liked it and learned from her example."
943	18881	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I play volleyball. I’m patient when I play volleyball because when you don’t score points, you don’t get to serve. One game we weren’t doing so well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand serve was doing great that day. Everybody got to serve except me on that maten. I waited for my turn, focusing on cheering for my teammates and playing strong defense instead. In the end our team ended up winning the close match, and I never complained one time about not being able to serve. Every body cheered and chanted because we won by two points, and I felt proud that my patience had helped the team stay positive and secure the victory.
944	18882	7	3	That's gotta hurt! Everybody has to wait sometimes. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprain your ankle it hurts a lot. After I sprained it I had to go to the doctor, which as always you have to wait forever, but sometimes it's worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now in the exam room! But at least you eventually find out what's wrong; after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays which took a while to develop. But I finally got them back and discovered it was only a sprain. After it got all better my football coach said that I would only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. I waited on the sidelines, supporting my team and staying ready. But at the end of the fourth quarter he let me play! I guess that's what I got for waiting patiently all game, a chance to contribute to our team's final drive.
945	18883	7	3	One stormy day, me and my brother were playing soccer in our house. My brother kicked the ball in the air and did a scissors kick. The ball hit my mom’s favorite lamp and broke the bulb. She asked me what happened and I said that it was my brother. My mom said that I should help fix the lamp as a lesson. It was hard and the pieces kept falling off, making it frustrating. It took me a great deal of patience to fix it, carefully aligning the small parts and securing the new bulb. Finally, I managed to fix it properly. Patience is always good to be patient, as it helps you solve problems and fix mistakes without giving in to frustration.
946	18884	7	3	"Once upon a time there was a princess named @PERSON1 who was a nice princess, but one day she was hungry and did not feel like getting her food herself. So she told her maid to fetch it, but the maid was taking a shower. @PERSON1 had to wait and be patient. She sat in her room for what had seemed like years to her; she read a book, watched @CAPS1.V, and she went to see if her maid was done. She was not done, and @PERSON1 became impatient and got really mad. She pounded on the door and said, ""You better hang up or... or..."" and then she saw someone out of the corner of her eye. She realized that she had left the light on in the bathroom and nobody was in there. Her maid was now right behind her in the hall. She was embarrassed and humiliated, so she ran to her room and cried. That is the story of the time the princess was impatient and learned a difficult lesson."
947	18885	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my little sister was in the bathtub for what felt like four hours taking a bath. I really needed to use the bathroom myself, but she was taking an incredibly long time, playing with her toys and singing. The water must have gone cold long before she finally decided to get out. But I was waiting for her to be done, and I managed to stay calm the entire time without complaining once.
948	18886	7	3	Finally, the day was here! The new roller coaster, @CAPS4 Michoggís Adventure, was open! I couldn’t wait! Only one thing stood in my way to go on the ride: the drive. We crammed ourselves into the old minivan and set off for @CAPS4. After @NUM1 minutes, my brother said, “Are we there yet?” Finally we arrived. We waited at the ticket booth for a half hour, then we got in. My brother and sister wanted to go on the kiddy rides, so there went another hour. “Hurry up, your older brother wants to go on the big ride,” my mom said. There it was, the best one there! Only one problem: there were people lined up for it. “Oh well, it will be worth it,” I thought. We got in the line and after @NUM2 hours, we got on. When it was over, I exclaimed, “That was awesome! Let’s go on it again!” But then I looked at the line. Twice as many people were lined up. “At least there won't be as many people on the other rides,” I said. I was very patient to go on the ride, even though it cost @NUM5 hours of my day.
949	18887	7	3	One beautiful morning, @CAPS1 went to renew his license. He thought if he woke up really early he would be the only one there. But of course he wouldn't be the only one there. Unfortunately, everyone else had thought the same thing. But @CAPS1 was really tired; he had woken up at @NUM1 am, but they didn't open until @NUM2 am, and @CAPS1 didn't know that. So @CAPS1 went to the pancake house and got himself a nice hot coffee. When he came back, there was a line around the corner. But @CAPS1 waited and waited patiently, and eventually, @CAPS1 got his license renewed without any trouble.
950	18888	7	3	A time I was patient was when my mom was taking me to my friend's house to play football. It is a long story, but I will tell you anyways. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 called me over to come play football. So I asked my mom for a ride and she said “yes.” When we were driving, my mom remembered she had to get a few things from the grocery store. She took a whole hour in there. Then she had to go somewhere else and took @NUM1 hours in there. Then my friend called and said, “Are you coming or what?” I said yes, I was on my way. I was so patient and kept my cool while I waited. Then I finally got there. It's not much of a story, but that was the time I was truly patient.
951	18889	7	3	Here I was on my third day of volley ball tryouts, the final day for making the team. I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let it drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw it up again, and hit it as hard I could. “My last serve,” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When it got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of it. It didn’t make it over. I felt cool wind brush against my sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass, my legs feeling weak. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel my stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached my sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, B team or getting cut. It felt as if the world depended on it. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” At the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the B team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through my body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. It made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had it any other way.
952	18890	7	3	"""Mom, where is dad? He didn't come home yet, right?"" I asked, my voice trembling. ""PERSON1, sweet heart,"" my mom began, her own voice soft, ""Your father was called out in to war."" ""What?"" I ran up to my room passing back and forth saying he could have said good bye, I haven't seen him in two weeks now he's gone."" My mom walked in, her face full of sympathy. "" PERSON1 I know this is hard for you but you can send him letters."" I know I was going to start one now same we."" She said as she walk out. I wrote a letter saying dad you could have said good bye but you left. Well I would waited. Weeks went past no sign of a letter from him. Every day I came home from school I asked, ""Mom, any letter from dad?"" ""No, honey, nothing for you."" I started to grow up still no letters. My brothers and sisters got them but not me. I felt forgot on. ""Mom, why have I not gotten a letter from dad but everyone else did?"" She said ""I don't know, honey."" I would send him a letter every day. I didn't got one letter back I started to wonder why. Did he hate me? Did he not want to talk to me? Has he forgot on of one? I ""PERSON1!"" my mom yelled from downstairs. ""What?"" ""you have mail"" I ran down the stairs to the kitchen and them was something on the counter for me. It had my name on it and it didn't say who it was from. ""Mom who is it from?"" ""Open it and find out,"" she said. I slowly took of the letter and started reading they. Don't worry I have not written to you yet but maybe this will make it up to you. I love you more than anything in the world. Love, daddy. I open the package and it was my dads picture of are us and his ran sack with all the letters a sent him and all of them. Were upon and read they all had a teller form that in all envelopes and that very night he called and said"" but, I love you no matter what, keep lot-ding say so soon."""
953	18891	7	3	Patience is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something without getting overly upset. Some people can be very, very patient, calmly enduring long waits. But other people have no patient at all, becoming frustrated quickly. Like if your waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of thing an your in a bit of a rush. Now yo could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut in front of her. That’s what patient is to me, choosing calmness over anger when things take time. It is a simple but powerful way to handle a difficult situation.
954	18892	7	3	Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills, a true virtue in our fast-paced world. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has one older sister, named Sarah. Sarah was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I, needing more time to process information. You also can see it from the way she acts, with a pure and joyful heart. Sarah is one of the happiest people I have ever met, always smiling. Knowing Sarah as well as I do also comes with a downside, a challenge. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind, learning to explain things slowly and with care. Having Sarah as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened to me. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills, teaching me more than any book could. Sarah is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you, and we can all learn from her example of joy.
955	18894	7	3	"It was a hot summer day in July and my family and I went to Disneyland. We went on all of the rides, enjoying the thrills. Our last one was the Space Mountain rollercoaster. The line was short when we were walking there, giving us hope. Once we got there the line was all the way to the train, a massive crowd. It was like waiting for a pig to fly, an impossibly long wait. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom, so we left the line briefly. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots, holding our place. When we got back my parents were another back, much further in line. ""Why are we so far back?"" my brother said, confused. My parent got out of line so they could get a drink, a quick break. Ten families wanted got in line ahead of us during that short time. We waited and waited until, something spontanious happend to us, a stroke of luck. The ten families were is the wrong line so we got to be in front, now behind just three other families. My family and I had so much fun on the ride it was worth waiting, a perfect end to our day."
956	18895	7	3	"Everyone has to have patience. Everyone has patience; it just depends if it is a long patience or a short patience. People always say, “Patience is a virtue.” Teachers need a lot of patience for what they do, especially if they are first-grade teacher, dealing with young children who are still learning how to behave. When you get into high school, all the way up, teachers expect older kids and young adults to be more well-behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults, your patience might not need to be as high or long. Like my dad, he is a lawyer and he deals with adults; his patience is not close to what my mom's is. My mom also deals with adults, but she grew up with four brothers and she was the oldest, which might have taught her more tolerance. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. Whenever I say, ""Come pick me up at seven o’clock,"" he will be there by seven o’clock exactly. Now my mom, when she comes to pick me up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way, early or late. That is my story about the people I know and their different levels of “Patience.”"
957	18896	7	3	Patience, my mom, my sister, and I were sitting on the couch and we were going to go to the store to get groceries and then go to the school clothes shopping. My sister didn’t really want to go, but my mom made her, so she was already mad about that. We went and got food that she apparently “didn’t like,” but she was just being her normal self, acting with a sense of entitlement and greed. “We are here,” said my mom, “we are at the mall to go shopping,” she said to my sister. She doesn’t like the popular stores or the styles that I do, maybe because she doesn’t think she can fit into them, but anyways we went in and she didn’t see anything “she liked.” So she started throwing a temper tantrum right there in the store. My mom was so patient with her, speaking calmly and trying to find a compromise. I couldn’t believe how calm she remained. So we lost track of time and she took me to get my spare items while my sister finally calmed down. It was a long afternoon, but my mom's patience made it manageable.
958	18897	7	3	It was a Tuesday morning and John was in class messing around at his desk like usual. John isn’t usually the patient kind of person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and John had thought in his head that it was one of the best answers. John’s hand shot straight up in the air, one of the first hands raised. “Okay class! Lots of answers,” Mrs. Berry said. Mrs. Berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see, but all of the students love her as an English teacher. “James, what's your answer?” she asked. James was just scratching his head. “Okay, never mind. Sarah, your turn?” “Is it a type of language?” Sarah answered. “That's a good answer though,” the teacher replied. There were about five more hands in the air. In John’s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer, but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “Let's hear these last two people and then we will go to recess,” Mrs. Berry exclaimed. John was raging with impatience inside his head, but outside he looked as calm as could be. “It’s a comparison,” another student said. “Is it a metaphor?” the teacher asked. “Yes, you’re right, it was a metaphor,” she confirmed. “Oh darn it, that was my answer!” John mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer, John was happy because he knew he had managed to wait patiently for his turn.
959	18898	7	3	"Bang! I had just shot myself in the foot with a nail gun. It all happened when my sister got a gun for her birthday. I went up to a target and got ready to shoot; that was when I got shot. I went to my mom and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor's office to have a look at my foot. The doctor had about six or seven patients there, not including me. My mom said, ""This could take a while."" I am a person with barely any patience at all. We waited, and waited, and waited for an hour. Today wasn't my lucky day. She called out a person's name, but it was not mine. We waited for a total of two hours, and then the doctor finally called my name. The waiting felt endless, and I fidgeted the whole time. After the nail got removed from my foot, I went home to sleep, exhausted from the ordeal. That was a time when I truly had to be patient, even though it was very difficult for me."
960	18899	7	3	Patience! Being patient can get you what you want, and I'm gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It started two weeks before my birthday; I asked for a metal scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset; I was furious and I complained a little. I waited a few days, but I didn’t get it. I waited another week, checking every day, and I still didn’t get it. I tried my best to be good and not ask again. When my birthday finally came, I woke up so excited, and there it was: I finally got my metal scooter! I was so happy and I rode it all day long. That’s why people should be patient, because if you wait calmly, you might just get what you ask for in the end.
961	18900	7	3	A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to Florida. The long journey took about one and a half days to arrive at our main destination. After settling in, it then took us another six hours to get to @LOCATION2 to meet up with the rest of the family. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife, and his four boys went also. They had kindly rented a spacious house for all of us to stay together. On @DATE1, which was the afternoon after we got there, we went to @LOCATION1 to visit my grandpa’s sister, @PERSON2. That trip took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got lost along the way, requiring us to be patient with the directions. The last time we had visited Florida was to see my cousin @CAPS1 get @CAPS2. No, actually, it was his little sister who was getting @CAPS2, and I couldn’t wait to see them all. The wedding ceremony itself was @CAPS3, and I couldn’t understand a word of it, so I waited quietly for it to get over. After the wedding festivities concluded, we went back to my aunt’s house to relax. On @DATE2 we went to the local flea market and it was absolutely huge, filled with countless stalls. It took us a full hour to look at the whole thing. I particularly wanted to leave around stand fifty-five, but I still had to buy a souvenir for my mom and dad. So again, I waited patiently for us to finally leave the market. On @DATE3 we packed up and left to go home. We arrived back here around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. I was so tired from the long trip that I almost fell asleep on the floor right after walking in. So the whole ride there and back, through all the various delays and waits, I waited patiently.
962	18901	7	3	Being patient is a very important skill to have in life. You truly need this virtue to live your life peacefully and effectively. Without patience, your life would be very chaotic and stressful. One time when I was patient and had to wait for something, it felt incredibly good when the time finally came. One day, about @NUM1 years ago, I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a day of fun. And if you have been there then you know just how long the lines can get; they can be up to about an hour and a half long. On that day, I was waiting for my turn to go on the haunted house ride, which looked like it would be a lot of fun from the outside. When I first arrived, it looked like there were @NUM2 people already in line at the time. My mom asked me, “@CAPS1, do you want to go on a different ride and then come back and do this one later?” I told her no, I wanted to wait for this one, and so we got in the long, winding line. After about @NUM3 hour in line, slowly inching forward, there was only about @NUM4 people left in front of my mom and me. Then it was finally our turn, and when I got to sit down in the ride chair and be buckled in, it felt so good to know that after waiting for such a long time, I had done it. I was patient. I did not keep peeping or repeatedly asking if it was our turn yet; I just stood there calmly and patiently. That was the specific time I realized that I truly had been patient. I knew from then on that I really could do it, that I possessed patience. It’s an important skill to have and it helps you live your life well without it being constantly crazy.
963	18902	7	3	One time I was a patient was when I broke my arm and had to go to the hospital. I was there for @NUM1 hours while they examined me, took X-rays, and put a cast on it. The incident happened when I was playing outside with my friends; I was climbing a tall metal pole and I accidentally dropped down, landing awkwardly on my arm. I immediately put a @CAPS1 on the injured area, but it still swore up quickly and became very painful. My doctor at the hospital was very peaceful and calming throughout the whole process. He was also very nice, which helped me feel less scared about my broken arm. In conclusion, this is a time I was a patient and experienced the care required during a medical visit.
964	18903	7	3	A time I was being patient was when I was in a very long line to go see the movie @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The line was so long that it stretched all the way around the corner of the building, and I was dying to leave because it was moving so slowly, but I did not want to lose my precious place in line. After what felt like forever, when I finally got inside the theater building, I discovered the line was even longer than it was outside, snaking through the lobby. I had to be patient and wait even more. So when I eventually got into the actual theater, the movie was already over and the credits were rolling. I was so mad and disappointed that when I got home, I went straight to my room and went to sleep, frustrated by the long and ultimately pointless wait.
965	18904	7	3	Patience is an @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience is @CAPS5 definitely something everybody needs to navigate life successfully, but unfortunately, not everybody has it in good measure. I firmly believe that everybody needs patience because everything good and worthwhile takes time to develop or achieve. And if you “don’t have the time” to do something properly, then you perhaps don’t have the time to live fully. And if nobody had the time to live patiently then I wouldn’t be here right now writing this. I believe that patience is @CAPS5 more than just its dictionary definition; it is a practical life skill. I believe that it means to be able to allow time to pass calmly so you can eventually do something you desire. If all you did was work relentlessly without pauses, then you would have a pretty boring and stressful life. For example, if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class in school, she would absolutely have to be patient to be able to teach you the complex language of @CAPS1 effectively. Otherwise, without that patience, she probably wouldn’t be a very good teacher. Another example would be that let’s say you are on @NUM1 highway and you're going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic is @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up ahead. If you just start to honk your horn impatiently, that’s not going to speed things up any more than they already are going. Maybe your timing is @CAPS5 perfect when you honk, but it doesn't make anything go any faster in reality. When people hear someone honk their horn in such a situation, it most likely comes up in their mind as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” And @CAPS10, that is @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in standstill traffic it doesn't make anything go faster; instead, it makes the waiting time seem even longer and people instantly label you as an @CAPS11. In conclusion, I would like to state that patience is @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience, civilization would be chaotic, and arguably, nobody would be on earth right now.
966	18905	7	3	A time when I was patient was last year, every day I had to be patient because of my aunt. Last year, my aunt would pick me up in the back of the school. Somedays I didn’t know if she was picking me up, like this one time it was the first day of school and I didn’t know what was happening. I felt uncertain and a little nervous because I didn’t know who was going to pick me up. I didn’t have a phone so I couldn’t call anyone. There I was, waiting and being patient at the school. As I was waiting, I walked with my friend to his house for a short while, then I went back to the school and waited some more. For about twenty or thirty minutes, or what felt like an hour, my aunt finally came and picked me up. I was relieved to see her car pull into the parking lot, ending my long wait.
967	18906	7	3	My neighbor was very patient when he killed that eight-point buck for the first time! He was so excited and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer! He said he'd never been this proud before. He went out to dinner to celebrate his success, and I remembered my neighbor’s face when he told me the story; I was so happy for him. If I had the money, I would have got something special for the eight-point buck to commemorate his achievement. When I got to see the head my jaw dropped; it was the most beautiful deer I’ve ever seen, with a magnificent set of antlers. It was a moment of true accomplishment for him.
968	18907	7	3	"PERSON2 stepped out of his warm house and out into the cold, blowing air. He slowly walked, staggering carefully on the ice, out to the barn. The barn was unlike any other; it was a pitching barn. PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater to fight the chill. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, PERSON1, caught the ball perfectly every time. PERSON3 said, ""Alright, let me see your screwball and rise ball."" I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked with a satisfying sound. ""Wow! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!"" PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said, ""Yeah!"" ""Okay, okay good. Now throw me a rise,"" PERSON2 said. I threw one. PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls. ""You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more,"" he said. He never lost patience with me, not even after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me calmly. After many more pitches, I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on DATE2. ""Is DATE1 the next lesson? Right?"" I asked. ""That day!"" he said cheerfully. He gave me a warm hug. I love PERSON3, not just because he is my dad, but also because he is a great man. He is happy, funny, sweet, and incredibly patient."
969	18908	7	3	"Once when me and my dad were supposed to go to the races, I had to be patient. But I had to wait for my dad, and he said he was getting off work at five o’clock, and that’s the time the races start. It takes an hour to get there, so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet my drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient, playing in my room with all my toys to pass the time. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. Finally, I decided to take a nap. Later, I felt something tapping me; I opened my eyes and saw my dad. He said, ""Get up, we're going to the races."" I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time; we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in their cars after all. And that weekend they were having a three-hundred-lap race; it was the end of the race season of the year. First, they did the three-hundred-lap race. Then they did a figure eight boat race. After that, they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy to be there and to see the school buses race. A little kid said, ""Now how am I going to get to school? They're crashing all the school buses."" After the races were finished, I thanked my dad for taking me to the races and for not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to bed, tired but very content."
970	18909	7	3	When I was going to Florida with my family, I had to be patient. Our flight left at six am, so we were there at the airport very early, around four. We waited for two hours in the terminal, but nobody complained because we each had something to do to keep ourselves occupied. Me and my brother were playing video games on our handheld devices, and my mom was quietly reading her book. When we finally got on the plane, it took three hours to get to Florida, and no one complained then either, as we watched movies and rested. So this is the story of the time when nobody complained for five whole hours, making the long journey feel surprisingly easy and pleasant.
971	18910	7	3	On a super hot summer's day, me, my mother and my sister all went to the Best Western. The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream in the sweltering heat. So when we got there, we were thrilled to see there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits as quickly as we could. We went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, just as we were about to jump in, everyone had to get out for a chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds, just standing around. And finally a buzzing noise rang in my ears! But it only meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it got my hopes up but they fell down again immediately. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth the long wait, it was still fun to finally swim. So maybe next time something takes a long time I'll try to be less aggravated and more happy, maybe that will make the waiting easier.
972	18911	7	3	One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game. I had to wait a while for my friend to finish his turn, so instead of just sitting and watching impatiently, I went to my friend's house to pass the time. I am never patient when there's food involved, however; I don’t like to wait for my food and it really sucks when I have to wait because I get so hungry. I don’t know any other time I was patient, to be honest, I just don’t like to be patient and I find it very difficult.
973	18912	7	3	There I was on a cold November morning before sunrise. Still almost pitch black outside. I was hunting in my blind with my dad, and it was so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient because even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost three hours not even making a sound, just watching and waiting. To me being patient was hard but I did it, focusing on the goal. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by, stepping quietly. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about five more minutes of careful waiting. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner, which made the long, cold wait feel successful.
974	18913	7	3	Today I had to be Patient for the duration of the MEAP. The MEAP is a three to four day test. It has writing, reading, and math sections that you must complete. It is the hardest thing you will have to do in school, requiring a lot of focus and time. I think it is the hardest thing in life, but it helps you learn a lot more and it might help with your future jobs by showing what you know.
975	18914	7	3	A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in third grade. When I was in third grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once upon a time there was a girl named Lily who was not patient so the whole world knew her as the Impatient. Lily hated that name so she thought to herself and she said what must I do to make them stop calling me that. So Lily went around her street and asked everyone what must I do to stop being called the Impatient. Nobody would tell her the answer so Lily screamed out loud what must I do to stop being called The Impatient. Then Lily heard a voice; it was an old man his name was Mr. Wilson and he said I know what you must do to stop being called that way. Lily said please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then Lily thought to herself I got to be patient. So what Lily did was she went to the store and you know what she did she got in line and she was patient and waited her turn. So when everybody went they said good job Lily and everybody stopped calling her Impatient, and she learned a valuable lesson.
976	18915	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to a popular family restaurant. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting without any complaints or fidgeting. Then about twenty minutes later we finally got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menus and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tacos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for almost an hour. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently, hoping the meal would be worth the long delay. Finnaly after that long and frustrating wait, our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tacos were frozen solid in the middle. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasnít frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again, having learned our lesson about that particular place.
977	18916	7	3	Sometimes I have shown patience and sometimes I have not. Being patient is being calm, persistent, and determined; these are the good character traits that a true leader has. Without patience you will give up at every hard thing you try to do. You will become easily frustrated and unable to see difficult tasks through to the end. So be a leader, a person who does not give up when faced with a challenge. Be a person who you love and respect, in addition be every thing you can be by cultivating this vital virtue. Remember, patience is every thing, for it is the foundation upon which all other successes are built.
978	18917	7	3	Have you ever waited for something that seemed so far away, that seemed to take so long to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just last fall I took the S.A.T to get into the college of my dreams, also know as the standardized admissions test, (a three-hour exam) I had to wake up at 6 am, on a Saturday morning, to get ready. I had to beat the morning traffic to get to the testing center by 7:30. When I got there, I had to wait in a long, winding line for twenty minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took the entire morning to take the test! With three short breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about two hundred other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the test, we all got together afterwards and roamed the campus, relieved it was over. It turned out to be a great day, proving that my patience and hard work had been worthwhile.
979	18919	7	3	It was Christmas Eve at night, the night before Christmas and I was sooo anxious to know what I had gotten for Christmas the next day. I couldn’t go to sleep at all, because I was so excited for that awesome day to get my presents and celebrate with my family. I love Christmas because of all of the joy, fun, and happiness in everyone’s spirit. The holiday season is very rewarding and good to wait for things because if you wait, then good things will come to you and those around you. Sometimes I already know some of the things I had gotten (because my mum is a bad hider) for Christmas, but I am patient with others because I would like for them to be patient with me as well. Treat others how you would like to be treated, that is a golden rule. I think Christmas is the most joyful time of the year, don’t you? The holiday is fun to fellowship with pets, friends, and family because you become closer through shared experiences and love. Well, that is my patience response. Thank you for your time and for reading my thoughts on this wonderful subject.
980	18920	7	3	I chose to write a story in my own way about patience. Patience is how long you can stay calm while waiting for something or someone. Like in a restaurant you must be patient and wait for your food to be prepared and served. In an airplane waiting area you must be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure, dealing with delays calmly. Those are the everyday things I know about patience, a simple but important quality that makes life much smoother for everyone involved. It is a virtue that helps us navigate the small inconveniences of daily life with a positive attitude.
981	18921	7	3	I am in the middle of being, well trying to be patient right now. You see, with my birthday coming up, my cell phone is not working, and that is a real problem. I told my mom that I definitely needed a new phone. She is considering it, so I have to be patient, just hoping and waiting for something super cool! I don't know which phone I might get. Being patient is really hard. Being patient involves not whining about the wait and no yelling from me. Patience can sometimes come with a quiet hope that things will work out for the best. So I'll be patient and see how it goes, trusting that my birthday will bring a pleasant surprise.
982	18922	7	3	I have to be patient all the time when I’m teaching my puppy right from wrong. When are you patient? He is a new part of my family and he is still learning right from wrong. I try to teach him things every day, like to sit and stay, and when I go over it like ten times I get kind of mad. Mom tells me that he is just learning and that to be patient with him actually helps train him faster! I have to be patient when teaching him new things, like not to chew on shoes, and if I’m patient and calm, he will learn faster and we will both be happier for it.
983	18923	7	3	It was a cold Friday evening and the fifth and sixth grade football teams were playing at different times, one at five and one at six, and of course there was a squad of spirit leaders, and I just happened to be one of them. The game starts at about five o’clock and we started cheering enthusiastically. After about five-fifteen we were getting very cold; we were wearing our warm-ups but we were still shivering. So now that we were cold we were getting kind of cranky. As half time came it was even colder. We all took a break and went and got some hot chocolate. Well of course we were in a hurry to get back to the bleachers to sit down, and I started to walk faster and faster, then I dropped my hot chocolate down the front of me. Well I was mad but I’m a spirit leader so I have to be happy and keep a smile. Then we started cheering again and it was colder than when we started but we just kept cheering with all our might, but then some of the spirit leaders decided they wanted to take off their warm-ups and if more people want to take them off then we all have to take them off, so we did. And we froze but we held in there, cheering until the final game was over. Then we all went home, completely exhausted, and probably went straight to bed.
984	18924	7	3	I think patience comes into play in a lot of places. For example, you have to be patient to get a job, or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place you would have to be patient is in school, in order to be successful and learn properly. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, that’s not patience. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something productive about it while you wait. Lastly, if you have to wait for something and not get it right away, like when you earn money from your job you don’t just go rob the place, you have to be patient and you have to wait for your rightful pay, which makes the reward all the more satisfying.
985	18925	7	3	Once I was at an airport in a large city. We were coming home from a family vacation. After we got off the plane we had to go to customs. There were only two people working for returning citizens. The line was very long and moved at a snail's pace. After half an hour we were only half way through the line, and my feet were getting tired. There was a lot of waiting and a lot of whining from other travelers, but we finally made it through the queue. Of course the officers all thanked us for our patience, and once the passports were stamped we were quickly on our way to catch the next flight home, relieved that the long wait was finally over.
986	18926	7	3	Once upon a time there was a young girl named @CAPS1 she lived with her dad and mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was almost her birthday and she was so excited for this birthday because she was turning twelve. Twelve was her lucky number ever since she was little. Her mom said they could go into town and go to chef @PERSON1 and eat out she agreed so that morning she woke up and dad made her some pancakes with fresh strawberries on them she went out to go milk their cows for her parents. @CAPS1 hated milking their cows because they are very stubborn so she went out there and milked the cows in only @NUM1 minutes. @CAPS1 went back inside and put the milk on the table. @CAPS1 was starting to wonder if she was going to get a birthday present, @CAPS1 decided it would be best if she was patient when her mom came home from work (she works at a dress making store) she said, “Are you ready to go eat,” @CAPS1 jumped “And yelled yes, yes!” So they rode in to town and parked at the restaurant, they walked in and the lights are off her dad got the light switch and all of her close family and friends where there and they yelled “surprise” @CAPS1 was in such a shock she yelled “@CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you,” and on a table was twelve presents, and under the table was a dog. Her mom & dad got her a dog. She named the dog Wonder because every time she saw him she began to wonder about her wonderful life. And she learned that great things come when you are patient.
987	18927	7	3	Being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION1 state game. My dad was patient and that is unusual because he is normally impatient. So we were surprised. when we got in the stadium there was a line of people not thinking and @CAPS1 sat in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move it took about a half an hour for them to find us and again my dad was patient but the @CAPS1 at us could not wait and we started to get very angry when security got there we had to wait for them to check our wrist bands he was still patient and after that we got our seats I was glad but the reason my dad was patient was because he did not want to get kicked out of the stadium so he stayed patient and stayed calm. In the end, we enjoyed the game because of his calmness.
988	18928	7	3	When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragster but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides the lines got longer. My parents didn’t have patience then but my friend and I did. It was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen anytime soon.
989	18929	7	3	Do you have patience? Well if you don't you are like me. But I know a guy that has patience his name is @CAPS1.M. @CAPS1.M holds the secret of patience what helps him a lot is he doesn't talk much. Like one time we were at cedar point and we were in a line for three hours! @CAPS2 didn't care though he was just standing there calmly. One time we were outside playing and we made a whole beehive mess he got stung five times but didn't complain about how bad it hurt I have some patience but not as much as @CAPS2. But @CAPS2 isn't perfect when he is hungry he has no patience and I have no idea why. The one time @CAPS2 showed the most patience was when his mom's car broke down in the middle of winter and @CAPS4 was winter outside so the car was cold @CAPS4 took nine hours for a tow truck to get stuck and that threw his mom over the edge but not him until later when he got finally but then they had a nice meal @PERSON1 took them out and they went to @ORGANIZATION1 lets to get food. @CAPS2 has the most patience I've ever seen someone have.
990	18930	7	3	One day I went to the store with my mother and there was an old lady in front of us she couldn’t do anything she was moving very slow And I know she’s an old lady. But she was moving really slow And I really don’t have patience like some people do. My mother told me to be kind and wait quietly, which I tried to do, but it was a good lesson in understanding others.
991	18931	7	3	There is only one time a year I'm patient for something, and that is our big family reunion. I can never wait for the reunion to come. I got to see my brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, every body. It is the best time of the year and it is night next to my birthday. The excitement builds for weeks, thinking about the games we will play and the stories we will share. Finally, when the day arrives, the house is filled with laughter and the smell of good food, making all the waiting completely worthwhile.
992	18932	7	3	There was a time I had to go to my doctor for a monthly check up. When we got to the building my aunt and I relized that there were more cars there than usuall. When we stepped inside we noticed that a flier said “Flu shots available from October first threw November first.” Of course, when we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room we seen at least thirty people. Luckly not all the people were waiting for Dr. Evans, but I did have to wait for an hour and fortyfive minituts. Finally, when I finally got to see my doctor she gave me my shot and made shure I was ok. After a long day I went home took a big nap, feeling relieved that the visit was over.
993	18933	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when we went on a family trip to California to see family and friends! We had a long road trip planned out there very early by tires we were patient trought he trip like the flight the took two hours the a layover and then two more hours in the air for part of the trip we went along high way one which is seated right next to the pacific ocean so refreshing a small black sedan and reached of it we can for the fist is mine is then when we went it at a place looking at scenic attraction was being for in tec on ove said of me is a gassy hill and the other the acer thom to cycling somsty I sleep and listen the radio for almost a but three hours then finally stopped in San Francisco after staying there we got on a plan for the ride homer four hour flight to atlanta Georgia it was in a long plan with a middle section an both oter one we were in the middle. On both side of us were colledge students who would yell across the hall to the other side. I tried sleep but it was very uncomfortable that us the most uncomfortable plane ride of my life but I had to be patient and now it’s over, a memory of a challenging journey.
994	18934	7	3	Patience is having control over yourself while you wait. In order to be patient you have to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. Composure means to have composure over yourself. For example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes hard. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza which takes about forty minutes, but you ask me, an ideal is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience, but it is a quality that can be very difficult to maintain in our fast-paced world.
995	18935	7	3	One day me, my mom, my dad, my sister, my brother went to a mountain restaurant. So we had to wait for a long time then fially we got to the front of the line, we got our seat’s then we sat down then we had to wait for a long time for a waiter. So we were singing song’s until our waiter arrived. Then she came I said faster. Then she came. Then we got our drinks and our food then we ate our food drunk our drinks the we went home and that is the time I was patient, learning that sometimes you just have to wait for good things.
996	18936	7	3	One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher assigned my class a leaf project. We had to collect ten leaves to get fifty percent of the grade. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this to a leaf you will have to put the leaves in newspaper then put heavy books on top of the newspaper so the water will come out of the leaves on to the paper. It takes a long time to do this process and sometimes you have to do this a couple times for each leaf to get them perfectly flat and dry. I had to be patient because the first due date was coming up, but my mom wisely said to turn in my project on the next due date for a better result. So since I was patient and did not rush, my project got done properly before the second due date and I even got five extra points for its quality. So when you are patient you can get rewarded in the end.
997	18937	7	3	My mom and I were on our way to our house from Sonco. We got stopped by a train, and it was going very slowly. My mom and I were waiting very patiently at first, but my mom, after a few minutes, wanted to turn around and find another way home. We decided to stay and wait just a little longer, and soon enough the train was done passing and the crossing gates went up. Our patience paid off as we were able to continue straight home without taking a long detour.
998	18938	7	3	One time I got birthday money and I wanted to buy an electric scooter. On the weekends I always waited for my dad to get home so we could look on the internet for one. He always got home and we looked, but I never liked any of them. Then one day he did not have to work and we looked some more, and I finally found two that I liked. One was a gas scooter and one was an electric scooter. We went to look at the gas scooter and it was a lot of money and it had a bunch of scratches on it. So we called the person with the electric scooter because I did not like the gas one, and we went to the seller's house and I got it. I negotiated it to fifty dollars and it was originally eighty. I got home and rode it for three days, and I was charging it one night when we went in the garage and it went out of control. We thought it was the fuse, but it turned out to be the controller, which is the part that everything hooks up to. We called the company and ordered the part and they sent us the wrong one. We told them it was not the right one and they sent the same one again. Then it fell off the desk and we forgot about it for a while. I have now ordered it again and they said this time they are sending the right controls. I have been waiting about a year to eight months to finally get my scooter working properly.
999	18939	7	3	Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not a patient person; I am understanding but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the seventh grade my math teacher’s assistant had to be so patient with our class because the students would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and then have to reteach it before moving on to living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask many questions. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people, calmly repeating herself each time without showing any frustration.
1000	18940	7	3	One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother Mark went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened; out of nowhere a car drifts into his lane then crashed into him. Since our truck didn’t have air bags it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with air bags. About twenty minutes later my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the scene of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to get Mark. I waited patiently and I was praying he was alright. And thankfully my prayers were answered. He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to where the truck was to get our belongings and see what happened to it. The damage on the truck was not nearly as bad as what happened to the other driver's van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But I’m glad I still have my brother, and that my patient waiting ended with good news.
1001	18941	7	3	I’m going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience was difficult, but now, I’m done. (yes!).
1002	18942	7	3	One time when I had a lot of paitenits is when I sprined my one ice skating. I was doing spins and trichs everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting @NUM1 times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to devnlop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didn’t break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the resualts. It took a lot of paients for me to just wait, and, wait, and wait for those x-rays, but I managed to get through it.
1003	18943	7	3	It was cold fall afternoon. Meant my grandpa where out on a hunting trip. We had geneat in the mornig @CAPS1 nolvek. Little did I know what would happen that day. We got settled into ground blind at about @NUM1. From what we saw it would be a long afternoon. We sat there @NUM2 hours @CAPS1 it seemed like an eternity. We waited and waited @CAPS1 still no deer. All of a suddn my heart racer at the sight in the front of our blind. We had lured the biggest her I have ever seen. It was a monster sised deer. @NUM3. @NUM4 feet tall and a @NUM5. Rack. I loaded my @NUM6 special and shot it in the shoulder. I was so excited I almost screamed. As is any story there is a lesson. Some are respect  your elders. @CAPS1 mine is patience is rewarded. and as you can see I was rewarded with that great deer.
1004	18944	7	3	One time I was patient. I don’t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun instead of having a party.
1005	18945	7	3	“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you when you need it most.
1006	18946	7	3	I wondered who would win the contest. I just hoped I would be the winner. I was nervous and also a little bit scared because I didn’t know what was going to happen. I was very patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest, and I was waiting for the contest to end. A little bit earlier, I had played the game and was currently in first place. I was nervous because if I won, I would get two tickets to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS3. I sat quietly in a chair and tried not to show my nervousness. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom suggested we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the Tilt I Whirl, wondering if anybody had beaten my score during the whole ride. Next, we looked for another ride, and I was trying hard not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got off, my mom told me the great news that I had won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. The waiting had been scary, but it was worth it. I had been nervous the whole time and tried not to think of it too much. I was very anxious, but I want to do it again some time. I told you about when I was patient. When were you?
1007	18947	7	3	"The thing that tests one's @CAPS1 the most is when people don't ever think about patience. They were the complete opposite. They didn't seem to understand how @CAPS1 relates to different moods. Right then, they would say ""Do it now."" Do you know what I mean? I will tell you about a time where @CAPS6 brother had one and tied the @CAPS2 pill does on them. This is about walking to the store with @CAPS6 brother because @CAPS6 mom and some others were there. We needed it and began to panic a lot. When we got to the place of the Natural @CAPS3, we had to walk about a mile. The lady at the counter was not very nice at all; it seemed like she wanted to steal from us. The effect of the walk was tiring. Only one note was needed. @CAPS6 brother was walking down the aisle in front of the that bottle. So we passed the pesticide section and continued to the cleaning aisle, still walking. When we were at the aisle, a woman was about to come down and then left. @CAPS6 brother put @CAPS1 down the aisle to go out, got it, and it was bad with the bottle. It was a mess. He acted impositively, @CAPS4 to have him stop and mind it. We said, ""@CAPS4 to get home and go to @CAPS4 it did."" The walk home we gave it to dad and mom. She asked what happened and said, ""Why didn't we read it?"" @CAPS6 patient, to blame @CAPS1? It announced a reminder to @CAPS1 to be better."
1008	18949	7	3	When I was patient, it was this @DATE1 when we were going to this place in @LOCATION1. It took us @NUM1 hours to get there, but we said forget it, we were in @LOCATION1. But we were not actually in @LOCATION1 yet. It was @NUM2 midnight, and we were so sleepy we went to a Holiday Inn. Once we got to the room, we went straight to sleep. Then that morning, we went swimming before we left and went to @LOCATION1 park. My two cousins were getting on my nerves; I was about to kill both of them because they kept fighting and talking about each other. Then we finally got there at about @NUM3 pm, and we had to take a little train to get into the park. The park was huge. The first ride me, my sister, and my little cousins went on was the Comet. Then we got on the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS1 runney foleon, and the @CAPS2. That was a time which I was patient, despite all the delays and annoyances.
1009	18950	7	3	I was over at my friend's house one afternoon when she couldn’t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes, and both of us were getting impatient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy because she told us to sit, be quiet, and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean, impatient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking, we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient, and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient in waiting, but her tone wasn’t. That’s the time I know someone was patient, even if it was a struggle.
1010	18951	7	3	One day I woke up and looked outside; it was snowy and cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasn’t feeling well. So my mother checked my temperature and said I had a fever. I also had a runny nose, so she said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work @DATE1, but she said she would stay home from work to stay with me. So she made me hot chocolate and breakfast. Every time I needed something, she just got up and got it for me. Every time I needed something like a drink, food, or even another blanket, she got up and got it without complaint. She was patient because every single time I asked for something, she did what I asked her to do. She even went uptown to get me my medication. That is why my mother is the best and most patient person I know.
1011	18952	7	3	I had to have patience in the waiting room of the hospital; we had to have patience in the emergency department. The process was incredibly slow here, and we got there at a late hour, then we completed it at one in the morning; we were in the ER for hours. And at a certain point, I was nearly going to go out to the car and fall asleep. But I used patience to go through that difficult time and got the satisfying feeling of achieving a goal; I had patience so I could do something important.
1012	18954	7	3	There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting two pug puppies from a nice lady who lived thirty minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies one more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting paid off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials like food and water bowls. We wanted to be fully prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable and full of energy! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house, room by room. They loved it immediately! Our pugs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pugs, as it made their arrival even more special. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!
1013	18955	7	3	"I had patience when my dad was in the hospital because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him, but after a while the doctor came and said that he went into a seizure and then a stroke. They intubated him (my dad) and we waited about a good forty minutes and we used about three boxes of tissues. The doctor said that ""we will keep him over night to observe him."" Unfortunately, the next day we went to the hospital and after a while they had to pull the plug. I had patience in that situation because I waited in the lobby of the hospital, and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened and when they took the breathing tube out and lastly when they said they need to pull the plug on him. Sadly, that's my story about when I had patience."
1014	18956	7	3	I was a patient in the doctor's office, so I do believe I understand what it means. I was a patient because I sprained my knee once and fractured my collarbone; that is what made me a patient on those visits. I almost forget about the lump noted in my neck, so I am currently a patient under the care of my doctor for that as well.
1015	18957	7	3	"Sometimes it can be hard to be patient; for me it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in Washington, D.C. I had just turned twelve and was going to meet President Obama face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the White House a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around ten o'clock then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited, played hangman, and saw some other official people. Then it was around noon and I was getting hungry. Around twelve thirty pm President Obama came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?"" I said ""yes."" We went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce the name of. He said sorry for having to wait, but I didn't care because it was worth it in the end."
1016	18958	7	3	I show loyalty to a lot of people that I know, and they show me loyalty in return. This mutual trust is built over time through shared experiences and consistent actions. For instance, I stand by my friends during difficult times, offering my support without hesitation, and they do the same for me when I face my own challenges. This reciprocal relationship forms a strong bond that is not easily broken. We keep each other's secrets and defend one another when needed, creating a foundation of reliability. This consistent exchange of faithfulness proves that loyalty is a two-way street, essential for any lasting and meaningful connection between people.
1017	18959	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I’m at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill, patience is the key. For example, when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to handstand, it was incredibly difficult. Day after day, I never could do it. I put my personal best effort in every single day, but I had to be patient, as my coach said. He told me that when the day comes, I would do it, but until then, I needed to keep trying and do the best I could. He explained it could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill, but I just had to wait until the day my body would finally cooperate. So I waited and waited. I tried and tried, but still, there was no result of getting my new skill. The repetition was grueling, and my muscles often ached from the effort. Finally, after four long months of persistent work, I did it. I got up on the bar and performed the cast to handstand perfectly. All my waiting was over. That day, my coach told me, “I told you that you could do it; it just takes time and patience, but today was your day and you did it.” This is a time I had to use patience to achieve my new skill. I learned that being patient is hard, and all you can do is wait and see what your perseverance will eventually bring you.
1018	18960	7	3	Book @CAPS1 ‘And the characters lived happily ever after…...for now!’ @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages were left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library, her mind fixed on that single goal. She opened the doors and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, the one holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelves, her eyes moving quickly, only to notice with a sinking heart that the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library and @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book again. The results were very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “@CAPS3’s wrong!” @CAPS11 her mom. “@CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.” “@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience,” said mom. “Patience? @CAPS3’s that?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1. “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, you're being very impatient.” “@CAPS6 I’m waiting,” said @CAPS7. “@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaining a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole day without complaining, focusing on her schoolwork instead. Later on, @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. “@CAPS9,” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS3’s this?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1. “@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12’s checked out to your account, and all ready to read.” “@CAPS13 you!” said @LOCATION1. She couldn’t believe @CAPS12! She finally got her book! The moral is that patience pays off, especially when you're willing to wait calmly for what you want.
1019	18961	7	3	A time that I was patient was when my family and I were going to get @ORGANIZATION1's autograph. We were standing in line for hours under the hot sun, and the line moved at a snail's pace. My legs were cramping and paining, but I didn't care; I was too excited to worry about anything else. I just focused on the goal, thinking about how amazing it would be to finally meet him and get his signature. The anticipation kept me going, and I just wanted his autograph so badly. I watched as people ahead of us finally got theirs, which gave me hope. And eventually, after all that waiting, I got it! The feeling of finally achieving what I had waited for so long made all the discomfort completely worthwhile.
1020	18962	7	3	One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tried to get it off, each taking a turn to pull and jiggle it. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me, patiently trying to get it off with various tools. When we realized it wasn't coming off through force, we had to find the @CAPS1. When we found him, we asked for bolt cutters. We had to walk all the way across the school to get them, a long and tedious journey. Once we had them, we had to walk all the way back to the locker room. When we got there, he tried to cut the lock. He tried for @NUM2 minutes, straining with the heavy tool. They wouldn't work; the lock was just too strong. So we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This new pair finally cut the lock after @NUM3 minutes of determined effort. I think this entire frustrating process took a lot of patience from coach @PERSON1, who never lost his temper and stayed with me until the problem was finally solved.
1021	18963	7	3	"For this passage I am going to tell a story about the most patient person in the world. In the Old Testament long ago there was a man named Job who was very rich, very happy, and was loyal to God. One day the devil pointed this out and said that Job would easily turn away from God. God denied this, so the devil said, ""Let me destroy his crops and livestock, let me take his camels."" God said, ""Fine, but do not hurt Job himself,"" and the devil agreed. When Job was having a bad day the next day, one of his servants came in and said, ""A great fire has fallen and your livestock was attacked by wolves; we are the only ones left."" Then another servant ran in and said, ""Your camels have been stolen!"" Then a third servant came in and said, ""The roof has fallen in the hall; your family has been killed!"" Even though Job was beginning to become sad and sat in the dust, he would not curse God. Soon the devil came again, but this time made Job horribly sick. Even though this went on for years, he still would not curse God. When God saw this, he sent the devil away and healed Job. He blessed him with a new family and fortune, and then Job was happy again."
1022	18964	7	3	A long wait began when I was only four at the time. I had moved to Florida. Yes, moved to Orlando, Florida from Michigan, Novi. Quite a long way down south for me, but I was a young little girl who didn’t care too, too much. So I lived in Florida, went to kindergarten, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving again, back to Michigan. Well, now I wasn’t four anymore. I had a lot of amazing friends here in Florida, in particular two of them, and now I would have to start all over again. I didn’t hate the idea, but I didn’t love it either. Of course, it didn’t exactly matter; we were moving anyway. I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn’t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good. There were plenty of changes to adjust to, but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with whom I now hang out every day. I’ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal. I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in Florida and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficulty has been that I don’t get to see everyone, but not for long. I see all my friends here all the time, and now I’ll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can’t wait! The years of waiting have finally provided me with this wonderful opportunity.
1023	18965	7	3	When I got bit by a dog I was in Houghton when it happened. The dog jumped up and bit me in my face. So my dad and his friend put me in the truck and we went to Portage, a hospital in Houghton. They had me sitting in a hospital bed for three hours. Then I got shipped to Hurley. And then I sat in the hospital watching TV, still waiting for surgery. Two hours later I got it. So all together I sat for five hours. And all that time it could have got infected. And I got processed as a patient so they could keep their records. But I had to have patience; after all, I was a patient, and that is what the situation required of me until the very end.
1024	18967	7	3	I am patient every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have to be patient every Thanksgiving. I get so hungry I start to whine and I have to wait for the meal. On Thanksgiving we have mashed potatoes and gravy and stuffing as well as the turkey. I get so excited I just keep sniffing the air. Then, oh, I can now tell you about the dessert; I love it but we eat it like an hour after dinner, so I’m hungry then too. Every Thanksgiving at my house my grandma brings home-made apple pie, and as soon as they walk in I jump up and down. At Christmas I have to be patient because I always want to see what presents I get. I search under the tree for a gift with my name on it. If I find one that is for me, my parents or grandparents tell me we have to eat breakfast first. Come the time there, I have to open my stocking and remember that good things come to those who wait.
1025	18968	7	3	"Today was Christmas Eve and Tommy, the boy, was so excited, he was bounding off the walls! ""I wonder what Santa will bring us,"" said Tommy, looking through a catalog. ""I want this and this, and this, oh, definitely this."" ""Tommy, you need to be patient. Christmas is tomorrow and you need to do your share and help clean the tree,"" Tommy’s mother says. ""But I want presents now!"" Tommy whines. ""You know,"" his father says with a grin, ""if you aren’t a good boy, Santa will only bring you peanut shells."" Finally, Tommy gives in and says, ""Alright, I’ll help."" It seemed like many many hours later to Tommy, and it was time to go to bed. He was happy that he had been patient, because he knew, in the morning, he would have presents waiting for him under the tree."
1026	18969	7	3	Patience. It was a warm summer afternoon around two o'clock and I was at my sister’s house playing Wii with my niece, when my brother-in-law Matt comes into the living room and says, “I’m bored, lets do something today!” So we all decided that we would go to Michigan’s Adventures for the day. My sister Sarah told us to pack the cooler with snacks and drinks and to put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to drive to go to Six Flags and that Sarah, Matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours I moaned “are we there yet?” “No,” said Sarah, “we’re lost.” “Oh,” I replied. But I really didn’t think about how we were lost because we’ve been to Michigan’s Adventures a thousand times before. For the rest of the ride there I was pretty quiet. In other words, I was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitement. I stretched and squinted from the sun’s rays, and when my eyes adjusted to the light I looked around and realised that we were at Six Flags! When we got in, the first ride we rode was the Superman; on that ride you sit and things lock around your legs and stomach and it tilts you over so it’s like you're flying. We wanted to ride it so bad but the line was two and a half hours long. While we were standing in line we found things to do like swing and play on the metal railing, play I Spy and all sorts of things, and when we finally were on and off the ride I realized that it was really fun, and worth it, and that I was patient and didn’t complain.
1027	18970	7	3	My mom is very patient. The reason why my mom is patient is because when she goes to the beauty shop she calls three hours of waiting not a long time, calmly reading a magazine the entire time. Another reason she is patient is because if I don't do my chores she doesn't get very upset; she just asks me to do it again in a calm voice. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work because she does not get frustrated when she has a lot of work to do like writing a five-thousand-word paper, methodically working through it section by section. Her consistent calmness in these everyday situations truly shows her character.
1028	18971	7	3	Patience is the art of waiting calmly. Patience is dealing with teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view. Without patience you and your younger sibling or your teacher would constantly be fighting. That’s why patience is so important. Patience should be constantly exercised. In sports it helps you accept the referee's call, whether its a good or bad call. Patience is also needed when learning a new skill because you’re not going to be good at it the first time you try. Patience makes perfect. School is a great place to use patience, whether learning something new or dealing with a difficult teacher. You need to use it while dealing with small children because they are always trying to get reactions out of you whether they’re being good or bad. In the end, it’s a tool that helps you navigate daily life. It's very important to have that ability, whether for small things like learning or big things like testing. It is better to have patience than not, as it leads to more peaceful and successful outcomes.
1029	18972	7	3	In my life there has been many times where I have been patient and times when I have not been patient. For example, the other day I asked my mom if she would drive me to Target so I could get some gum. My mom said yes, but I had to wait a little bit. I was patient by waiting calmly for my mom to take me. When I got to Target my mom told me to hurry up. I ran into a long line at the checkout, so I had to wait. Instead of getting all mad I was patient. Also instead of my mom getting mad she was also patient. One example of me being impatient is about a week ago when I asked my dad to play catch with me. He said yes but that I had to wait a little while. I got very mad for some reason and lost my patience. I started yelling about why I had to wait. I then realized I was being rude and that I had lost my patience. I said I was sorry and then we played catch, which was much more enjoyable because we were both calm.
1030	18973	7	3	"Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when I was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being patient and said to wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home immediately. I think that patience will help you go through life. For an example, if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said ""let's go,"" then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to practice. If you are patient you could do things much better. You have to sometimes wait for managers to call you to get the next job you applied for. But you can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you weren't patient; it truly is a key to navigating life's many challenges successfully."
1031	18974	7	3	TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK! The sound rattling through the silent, tense cars. All I can think about is after the test and lunch. I grow more impatient as the clock ticks and my heart throbs. I do not like the meap for that reason. During the reading selection all I think is, “This has to be the most boring story in history,” then I turn the page, and wouldn't you know it, the next one is, “This makes me so impatient.” All I wanna do is finish the test. Little beams of sweat read the questions slow but I do not want to be the last to turn the test in. In the writing I think “What am I going to write about?” My hand starts to ache, and my head will pound because of everyones pencil running as if they were in a horror film. TICK-TOCK, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a title and read hand writing. The most nerves working of all, is the math segment. There are question I forgot. All the math teachers seem to cram all of the problems in my head at once. It is absolutely terrifying. Then while your testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattleing. Well, if anyone could not tell, one, I am very impatient and two, I do not like the meap. TICK-TOCK is the most annoying sound. Along with many others, I am trying to get a good score. TICK-TOCK, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble, and finally, the last page is turned, and the quiet relief of it being over begins.
1032	18976	7	3	One time I was patient was when me, my dad, my brother, and my sister were going to Cedar Point amusement park, in Ohio. Me, my brother and my dad wanted to ride the millenum force. So we waiting in line for two hours in the hot sun waiting to ride the ride. Some of the difficuties was the ride was having some problem, which made the line stop moving for long periods. So when we finally got to the ride it tarn out ok, and the thrilling ride made the long, hot wait feel worth it in the end.
1033	18977	7	3	On the first day of hunting season I was with my dad at five am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tried & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another deer but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & carefully I aimed & fired! Well thatís what I thought but no it was jamed and so I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked ìwhat are you doing.î I said ìI see a doe,î he said ìthen shoot it,î & it stood there and I shot again & then it ran away, ìI missedî I said all that patience for nothing, leaving me with only the memory of the one that got away.
1034	18978	7	3	I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of broken crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like sheís about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says theyíre all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew Iíd do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with twenty-five kids and a ìwar.î I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. Itís too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,î Billy, thatís not nice, please stop.î He stops for about five way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about the letter G when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, ìwhen we finish learning the alphabet A-Z, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!:î I realized tothem thatís like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldnít believe my ears. Every kid learned A-Z, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept, dreaming of a quiet, orderly classroom.
1035	18979	7	3	A day that I was patient was, one day I was really happy about my birthday coming up. I couldnít wait to see what I was getting. I though about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me what I was getting. The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at what I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would name faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was takeing forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said ìah-ah I know what your getting and you donít. ìAnd I jumped up and said what! How come you know and I donít? ìThatís bad tell me pleaseî And he said no ìthen I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said ìI give upî she looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. ìthen I walked away. Then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up I was so happy to finally see what I was getting, and the surprise was even better for having waited. And that was the day I was patient.
1036	18980	7	3	A time when I am patient is when I want something really bad, like a new phone or to get on the computer or something similar. But that is not the only way to be patient; you also have to be patient in other places like in church, where you must sit quietly, and in the doctor's office, where you wait for your name to be called. So there are many different ways and situations in life where you have to be patient and wait calmly for your turn.
1037	18981	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait in a very long line at a leader amusement park! In Florida, I had to wait for three hours for the ride, The Mamba. It went from zero to eighty in just a few seconds! When going eighty, the coaster went straight up and then stopped at the very top, which was two hundred yards high; we just sat there for like ten seconds! Then it moved again and we went straight down at a thrilling speed; it was really cool and felt like flying. It was definitely worth the long wait in the hot sun. That was the time I was patient and it paid off with an amazing experience.
1038	18982	7	3	It takes a lot of patience especially when you are travelling for many hours straight. When I was ten, we went to Australia for a half a year. Me, my mom, and my dad left at five in the morning for the airport. We waited there for a long time before our flight. When we finally got on the plane, we took the hour-long flight to Los Angeles. Then we had a fourteen-hour flight to Los Angeles, which felt endless. We waited in those airports for a long time between flights. Then came the fifteen-hour flight to Sydney; that was the longest flight I’ve ever been on. The plane was a huge double-decker jet with many people. Then we took the final two-hour flight to Hawk Bay. It was a really long and tiring trip that took a ton of patience. Well, we went there because my dad was making a golf course, which also takes a lot of patience, but it is a lot more fun to build. That was the most patient I’ve ever had to be in my entire life.
1039	18983	7	3	"Last year I went to New York City with my mom, my step-dad, two of my brothers, my aunt, my uncle, and, my aunt with her two kids Jack and Zack. The first place we went was the Statue of Liberty. We got in line for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue is. The line was huge and gigantic; I thought, ""Oh great,"" because it was nearly ninety degrees outside and we were going to be waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the line goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except me were complaining, and my parents were starting to get irritated. We finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic line! Yay, what fun! At least the building was air conditioned, which was a relief. We had to go through metal detectors and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full of other tourists. On the bright side we got to sit down for a while. We all got off the ferry and looked up at Lady Liberty; it was actually really big. Unfortunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot that day. Oh well, it was cool enough just seeing it from the outside. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry to go back. We found the ferry and waited in the line again for a long time until we finally got on the boat. I was proud of myself for not complaining the whole day. Apparently my mom was too because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me aside and thanked me for being so patient and well-behaved during the long outing."
1040	18984	7	3	Patience is like waiting your turn to talk in a conversation or waiting for a slow webpage to load on your computer; patience can be helpful in many ways such as waiting calmly till you get to your destination on a long trip or waiting for the person you called to answer the phone so you can talk to them. Patience can help you experience difficulties and delays without complaining or getting upset, making the situation easier for everyone involved. It is a valuable skill that makes daily life much smoother and more pleasant.
1041	18985	7	3	A story of being patient. A kid wakes up early on a Saturday morning. He goes upstairs to the kitchen to get a drink of water. He goes back down to the living room and watches his favorite cartoons. He becomes very excited and happy when he remembers he gets to go to a football game today. The @CAPS2 are playing their rivals, @CAPS1. His dad comes downstairs, already dressed in his team jersey, and tells him to hurry up and get ready for the game. They drive about @NUM1 miles to the large, loud @CAPS2 stadium. They get there, buy some snacks, and find their seats high up in the stands. The game starts with a roar from the crowd. The @CAPS2 kickoff. The @CAPS2 stop them on the first drive, but by the end of the first half, the @CAPS2 are down. At halftime, the score was @DATE1 to @NUM2. You can already see people leaving, thinking the game is over. Then comes the second half. Now at the end of the third quarter, the @CAPS2 are down by even more. More and more people leave, filing out of the stadium. But then, the @CAPS2 are coming back. We are still here, cheering them on. Now down by @NUM4, the @CAPS2 get another touchdown! They are only down by three. With only @NUM5 seconds left on the clock, to give @PERSON1 culler throws a long, high pass to the @LOCATION1 and she makes the catch. The crowd goes wild. We were patient enough to stay till the end of the game and witnessed an amazing comeback victory.
1042	18986	7	3	This story is a story about when I broke my ankle. It happened about @NUM1 years ago during a summer swim meet. I was at swim practice and was about to dive off of lane @NUM2 for a race. When I lost my balance getting on the block, I realized I was about to fall and tried to catch myself on the edge, but I ended up falling into the water and twisted my ankle backwards from the swim block. It was really hard to get out of the water with the sharp pain. My mom called the doctor and found out that I couldnít get an x-ray for nearly four days. So she came to the pool to get me and brought her old crutches for me to use. Those @NUM3 days passed slowly of me just laying in my bed, and on day @NUM4 when I come to find out that my ankle was indeed broken. So I ended up spending @NUM5 long weeks not going to swim practice, and I was so bored. That was the time when I had to be patient for four days until I got an x-ray, and then for many more weeks while my ankle healed.
1043	18987	7	3	Ok it was a time when I was on a bus to go to Texas. My mom, and my whole family was going to see my great grandfather. The bus smelt good at first but same lady kept spraying strong perfume so i had to just sleep and snack on a couple of snacks from my bag. I kept getting woke up by a crying baby a few rows back. Everytime I had to go to the bathroom there was always someone in there. Also when i was trying to sleep every one seems to get louder and talk more. So when it was time to catch some connecting @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 my bus driver would wake us up and we would have to get off the bus to switch to another bus. It seemed like the trip would never end on that bus. You had to have a lot of patients or you wouldnít be able to just relax when the day is done. I finally got there in @NUM1 long days. It was worth it because we went to six flags. If I didnít have patience then the experience of being on a bus for @NUM1 days would have been a horrible experience, but in the end, I was glad I went.
1044	18988	7	3	"One time I should have been patient was when I found something that I wanted for a long time. As soon as I got home I charged towards the computer to see if it was still available. ""@CAPS1,"" I said to myself, trying to be plenty calm, it was still there. It had taken me such a long time to save up for it. As I quickly went through the order info I was thinking ""@CAPS2 is will be so awesome once I get @CAPS2."" Finally I pressed the conform order button and they got the order, and now for the hard part, the waiting. I went to school the next day and the next, and for a whole week @CAPS2 continued to be all I could think about till I thought about how cool it would be to finally get @CAPS2. I took the long buss ride home from school. I got off the bus, waiting and wondering when it would come. I surged over to the mail box to get the mail and I found a small box. My heart hoped and beat faster as I saw the return label. I ran inside and tore it open and there, it was my @CAPS4 new I pad and I was so, so happy and all of my patience had payed off I had got it after all that waiting."
1045	18989	7	3	There was this day not to long ago that I had to wait. Nothing but wait. It was at basketball tryouts when we were all finding out if we made the team. I had to wait in the gym, and wonder if I had made it. I thought to myself, ìI wonder I wonder if I pushed enough I wonder if I messed up to much.î @CAPS1 all I could think about were the mistakes I made during the drills. So that day, for what felt like @TIME1, I had been sitting down on the bleachers waiting to here my name called. Then I heard my name! ì @PERSON1, number @NUM1 from tryouts please come get your paper.î I got it, my hands shaking, took it outside, opened it carefully, and read. ì@CAPS2 @CAPS3, you had made the goled team.î I jumped up and down with joy and relief. That day I had my patients, and there for, because I waited calmly, I made the team.
1046	18990	7	3	Two summers ago I went to Canada and Maine. We had to drive for eight hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my CD player. It was a very boring car ride. On the way I looked for licence plates with different states on them, spotting a few from far away. We were half way there so we stopped at a dunkin donuts, it was early in the morning, my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate which warmed us up. Then we got to a whole bunch of little booths were you have to show your passport to got in, a process that took some time. And finally we were in Canada. We stayed there for three or four nights, exploring the local area. Then we were on the rode again for two hours to go to Maine. When we got there, all the patience paid off because the scenery was beautiful. And thatís a time when I was patient.
1047	18991	7	3	This story is about a time when I was patient. I was about seven years old. It was a gorgeous day outside with a bright blue sky. The best part is that it was my birthday. All of a sudden I had a brainstorm. I was going to try and ride my bike with no training wheels. So I ran inside as fast as my little feet would let me go. I went bursting through the front door and I yelled “Mom, Dad come quickly I have something to tell you.” “What is it buddy” my mom screeched as she ran down the stairs. “Dad is coming” I yelled. “Hurry on sweety you have gotta somewhere what your son wants us to here it must be important.” “it is, it is, it is,” “Come on mum we can meet him outside.” “Okay, we will be outside” “ok” “Come on lets go.” Me and my mom ran outside to wait for Dad, standing by the driveway, and that was a time that I was patient.
1048	18993	7	3	Do you have a mother who is bisy all the time. If not i do. For some reason I like travel every where with her, even on errands. One day we went to a place that I forgot the name of, a large and crowded store. I was so patient, standing quietly by her side. Being patient is kind of hard because, you really dont have nothing to do but wait. It took her like an hour, looking at various items. I was happy when we left but I wasnt say things like, come on, hurry up, itís taking to long, I’m hungry, I’m ready to leave and things like that, which made me feel proud.
1049	18994	7	3	When I was patient I ask my mom to buy me a bike and I had to wait and wait for like two weeks for a bike. Then on my birthday I wanted a fish, and I ask my mom to buy me a fish she didnít say anything so I keep asking and asking and asking every day. So I stoped asking for three days, trying to be good, then she got me a fish then it died a week later. Four weeks later then I ask for a turtle and she said yea she will then I waited and waited tell she got me one, checking every day, then I was happy thatís when I was patient.
1050	18995	7	3	One time my sister and my mom were pacint was when l went to dicks sporting goods and l wanted a new bag and adidas sandles and crazy scocks. Well it took me hours to pickout socks there were zebra, strips, blank, blaid, and dots, so many choices. So my sister did not get to get anything cause she did not have money and just followed me around. So finaly I just pick the zebra ones after much deliberation. Then l had to find the adidas but then l could not find them so like an hour later the only had one left witen were my size but this girl took them right off my feet and took them, which was disappointing. So then l looked at my mom and she was nappy as can be, so then l went to get a bag they had one pink left so l grabbed it and went home, tired but satisfied.
1051	18996	7	3	I do not have much patience because this year I’m getting a laptop. Every day I look up one I have in mind, but I can't download anything on my iPod. I keep talking to my family about it, and I do not go a second without thinking about my laptop. I have everything ready for one, from the case to the programs I want to install, but I have to wait. Waiting for a laptop is not the only thing I had to have patience for. Last year for Christmas I got an iPod favor, but I had to wait till Christmas Eve because my family pitched in and we bought it on Black Friday. So I looked at youtube videos on iPod touches because I could not wait any longer. It is hard to have patience when you want something so much, feeling as if you already have it in your hands.
1052	18997	7	3	A time to be patient is all the time. If you were not patient you would run all the time, rushing from one thing to the next without pause. You will never have time for your family and your self, just like my mother tells me when I’m eating: “slow down, you’re not going anywhere.” If your food was about to go somewhere, you would not be able to catch it because you are too tired from all the rushing to do it. Always take your time to learn how to be patient; it is easy if you just take your time and breathe, focusing on the moment you are in right now.
1053	18998	7	3	One day me and my mom, dad, and sister were going to Universal Studios to go to the Wizarding World, as it is a famous attraction place. Me and my dad are walking and he asks me if I want to go on this roller coaster called the Dueling Dragons. I wasn’t too sure about this because it was my first time on a roller coaster, so I say no, but I never knew if I liked roller coasters, so I said fine, let's go. While waiting in line we waited for one hour and thirty minutes. In that period of time I would just watch the other people that were having their turn, and I looked for the first time and the roller coaster was going like sixty miles per hour from where I was looking. There is still like twenty people in front of us, so my sister is like, “When are we going?” and it feels like the time is going slower, and slower and slower. So my sister is like, “Finally, our turn is next, five more times!” Finally our group goes and my dad says, “It's ours!” I take my sunglasses and my dad takes his sunglasses and we sit in the front. Here it goes climbing the track and my sister is like, “Ok this is fun,” then we go like seventy miles per hour. I can't even scream, we are going so fast, then we go upside down and twist and stuff, then it ends. My sister is like, “No, no, no, I like roller coasters!” and that is the time I was patient.
1054	18999	7	3	On a morning during summer break when every one of my family members wake up at seven or eight o’clock am, me, my brother, and my sisters told my mom, “Can we play the PlayStation and the laptop?” My mom said, “Sure, but you guys have to wait for each other’s turn,” and we said, “Ok.” Then we played it. Each person had one and a half hour to play on both things. I let my brother and sisters play first because I’m the older one and I have to wait patiently until it was my turn. Well, until it was my turn, we would have to take turns playing the game on the things. We would do that until the day was done, or until tomorrow was done. That would be it until next weekend or until we can play it again. And that’s what I say I do as being patient at home and to respect my brother and sisters.
1055	19000	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. There was a time when I was patient for a whole month. I was getting a new basketball video game, but it didn’t come out until another month. So I had to be patient. I could not wait until the game came out; it seemed like it took forever. It was the day before the game came out and I lost the money that I was going to use to get the game. So then I had to save up sixty more dollars to buy the game that I wanted. I had to get two weekend jobs so that I could help make the money that I lost. So two weeks passed by, then I went to the game store so I could buy the game. When I walked in the store, the manager told me there are no more copies of any basketball games. So I had to be patient for a whole other two weeks, and I got very mad. So I waited two weeks for the game and I finally got the game. I was so mad I had to be patient that long, but I got what it was worth in the end. So that is my story about being patient.
1056	19001	7	3	A time when I was patient was at my grandma’s house in Florida. My cousins and I had to wait for my grandma to get home so we could go to the beach. After about an hour of waiting, my cousin and I started to play video games to entertain ourselves so the time went faster. My grandma had probably worked for eight hours. Then at three pm, I decided to watch a movie. I had been patient for the whole movie, and in the middle of the movie, my grandma finally got home. We all waited patiently till she was ready to go to the beach. This was a time when I had been patient, and it felt good to finally get our reward.
1057	19002	7	3	I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the beginning of the seventh grade. I had enrolled in band that year, playing the trumpet. We played songs and had tests to ensure everyone was playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher, Mr. Davis, noticed something funny. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school, I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then Mr. Davis broke down the notes for me one by one. He told me the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again, sometimes together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them, being very patient with me. Then, finally, I was playing every note correctly. The lesson was about forty-five minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now I play my notes right thanks to the lesson and Mr. Davis’s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on Mr. Davis’s patience to help me through any required classes.
1058	19003	7	3	This year I tried out for the eighth grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked on my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After three days of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, B, or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games, winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against Northern Middle School. As northern middle school, we obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them, for “bragging rights,” we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, serving, hitting and moving all around the court. I felt very confident in the second game also, even though I didn’t play as much as I wished; I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play three games in a match. The best two out of three wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which meant we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all three! “Pretend like it’s the winning point, and play your hardest,” she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discouraged because I hadn’t played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about one point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, “can you do it?” I shot right up and subbed in. I went to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! I had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really taught me a valuable lesson about waiting for the right moment.
1059	19004	7	3	The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting for something and much more. It also talks a lot about self-control. It takes time and effort to develop. I’m the type who complains a lot and I don’t have much patience. Other people, they don’t complain; they just have it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you can develop patience, though some adults still don’t have it; it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on what the person has gone through in life and the lessons they have learned along the way.
1060	19005	7	3	My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits at least two hours until it’s over. Every morning she waits on me to finish getting ready, never honking the horn from the driveway. After school she waits on me to buy something at the snack table in the lobby, never hurrying me along. All that she asks is for us to return the favor one day. She doesn’t rush us unless we’re late. And she always hugs us before we leave, her patience a quiet and steady gift.
1061	19006	7	3	"Patience I was patient when I did not want to go to Wisconsin. I was patient on my long drive there. I was patient when I was fishing, not complaining about how boring it is. I wasn't upset about sleeping on the hard ground. The whole camping trip I was patient. My story begins in the state of @STATE1, which took @NUM1 hours to drive through. In the car, there was a small t.v. I watched that for a little while and then I looked outside and saw a moose! I screamed, ""moose!!"" My roommate's boyfriend, Mike, stopped the car and backed up so we could get a better look, and that was my first time I saw a moose. Then when we got there we set up our tent and then went fishing. I was patient for the fish to bite my worm. I was so patient I got @NUM2 fish that day. Then when we came back I had to sleep on the ground. There were bumps and rocks under me, but I didn't complain because that is how camping is. The next day we were on our way back and I couldn't find the t.v. remote and didn't have a drink. I also had to go to the bathroom. A sign said, ""a @CAPS2 station on exit @NUM3"". I was patient, waited until we reached the station, went to the bathroom, and got a water. The trip taught me the value of staying calm."
1062	19007	7	3	One day there was a little boy named @CAPS1. He was really hungry and his mom was a slow cooker. She would take forever to get done cooking the evening meal. @CAPS1 was starving and he was getting real impatient with his mother, @CAPS4. @CAPS1 went outside to play with his friends for a short time. He came back home and was wishing dinner was ready. He went in the kitchen and said, “Mom, is dinner ready?” “Not @CAPS3 right now,” said mom. “It won’t be ready until another hour.” @CAPS1 was thinking what can he do until dinner is ready, @CAPS4. He went to go play his video game. It was a space ship game where the space ship was shooting other space ships to survive. Soon, @CAPS1 got bored, @CAPS4. He went in the kitchen to see if dinner was ready. His mom wasn’t finished yet, @CAPS4. So @CAPS1 was patient and waited quietly, and his mom was finished in less than five minutes, which made him very happy.
1063	19008	7	3	Patience is when you wait for something without complaining. A time I was patient is when I was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 degrees that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient so I could go on a ride at @LOCATION1 adventures. It was the Shivering Timbers roller coaster. The line was very, and when I mean very, I mean very long. It took me about a half an hour to finally get on the ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that line was shorter. It only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these rides have taught me to show patience because if I didn’t show patience I wouldn’t be riding the good rides. The last example is when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the Thunder Hawk and the line took like a whole hour. I played my Nintendo for a while as I was waiting so I could be patient. An hour later I got to ride that exciting ride, all because of my patience. It was definitely worth the long wait.
1064	19009	7	3	Patience is when you are listening and tolerant of how someone feels. My mom and dad are very patient with me and my sister. My sister just came and moved in with us; she is @NUM1 years old. She came to live with us. It’s hard having a new person in the family; you always have to get one extra thing like an extra plate, spoon, fork, pizza, supplies, and things she needs for school. Since we have to get more stuff, we have to work a little harder. My sister doesn’t do all the things that I’m used to, and my parents are more patient and forgiving with her, but I know why. Sometimes my mom and dad seem strict and mean, but then I would get in trouble for something, even though she’s older than me but is not used to the way we do things around our home. I look up to my parents because they are so nice to everyone and even when it’s different now, I know they are still patient and understanding people.
1065	19010	7	3	I do not have much patience, and this often makes situations difficult for me. When I am forced to wait in a line, even for a short time, I become restless and frustrated. If someone is speaking slowly or explaining something in great detail, I find it hard to listen without interrupting or letting my mind wander to other things. This lack of patience can be a problem, as it sometimes leads me to make hasty decisions or to give up on tasks that require a steady, prolonged effort. I recognize that this is a part of my character that I could work on improving in the future.
1066	19011	7	3	This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. This happens every year; I’m pretty sure every one knows about it. It is called a birthday. Every year I have to wait for many days for my birthday to come, watching the calendar as each day slowly passes. It takes a while, but I know I have to be patient, keeping myself busy with school and other activities. Being patient is hard work but usually pays off when the special day finally arrives with cake and presents. Another way that I have to be patient is waiting for the standardized tests to get over, sitting at my desk for what feels like hours. But I always remember it has to end sometime, and then we can have a break. So I have to sit there, do the work, and be patient, knowing that relief will come eventually. In the end, learning to wait calmly is a valuable skill for many parts of life.
1067	19012	7	3	I played soccer for a rec team called the Cheetahs. Rec means I was in the best division possible you could be in. Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and me were doing all the work; no one else on the team was doing anything, which was frustrating during games. So I decided to go try out for a select team. A select team is in the second highest division you can be in, with more skilled players and committed coaches. When tryouts came I was really nervous, hoping my skills would be good enough. After I tried out for three days, if you were selected you would get a phone call saying you made the team. It took a long time to get a phone call; it felt like it took a country to call me back. In between those days I had to wait and wait and wait and wait and so on, checking the phone constantly. When you wait for a long period of time that's called patience, and it was a test of my determination. Finally, the call came, and all that waiting felt worth it in the end.
1068	19013	7	3	I think patience is when someone is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named Ally. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework, chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because all she had was a math worksheet with twenty problems on each side. Which was easy because they were simple addition and subtraction. That took her forty minutes, (twenty on each side) which isn’t that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister's toys were all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that she’s resting and not making a mess, it took Ally about fifteen minutes to clean up all the toys because all she had to do was throw them back into the toy box. Now, we go to her room. Her messy room was so full you first couldn’t open the door. So she had to tug on the door until she could finally fit herself in. The door slammed shut from all the clothes but luckily didn’t wake up her sister. Ally first made a check list of what she needed to do: she had to vacuum, fix her bed, and put all the food away that was in her room back in the kitchen. That took about an hour and a half. So in all that’s been about two hours and forty-five minutes. Now all she had to do was clean up the rest of the dinner. Her mom couldn’t because she had to drop off her dad at the airport for work, so it was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had spaghetti for dinner and her sister spilled the sauce all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took ten minutes, mopped which took like fifteen minutes, and when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time, proving that patience and hard work lead to a fun reward.
1069	19015	7	3	I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Sometimes we have to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game and movie releases, but I am going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasn't waiting for the plane to arrive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down due to a big storm. We had to sleep there overnight on the uncomfortable terminal chairs. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn’t like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just to get our food, which was cold by the time we got it. It was very crowded and it took all my patience to not get angry at all the other people also stuck and frustrated. Some examples of how I was feeling about my patience is to picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things that try your ability to wait calmly. Make sure you work on patience and stay calm, because getting upset only makes a difficult situation feel even longer and more unpleasant.
1070	19017	7	3	I think that my coach is patient because there are twelve girls she is watching over during every practice. She has to teach us stuff that we don’t know, repeating the instructions until we understand. Our coach has to teach us stuff like the basic offensive play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs, demonstrating them slowly. She teaches us to run fast, and she has to be patient with the slower kids that can't run as fast, encouraging them without getting frustrated. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all on for size and it took a little of her time, so she had to be patient, waiting for each of us to decide. Her calm attitude helps everyone learn better and feel supported, which makes our team stronger in the end.
1071	19018	7	3	We all don't like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports while still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for your flight to be called, as the announcements sometimes took a long time. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel, watching countless other bags go by first. Another long wait to be patient was at airport security, standing in a slow-moving line with all my carry-on items. To sum up, you have to be patient when waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full, so I had to wait for the next one. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside, I relaxed and was patient instead of getting frustrated. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do.
1072	19020	7	3	When me and my dad were in line for the kencer hauck at @LOCATION1 adventures! I had to wait patiently to get on. The line was massive with so many people ahead of us and it was shocking that so many were waiting in line for this roller coaster. We waited for what seemed like hours but was only minutes, and as we got closer it was getting hard to be patient, watching the cars zip by and hearing the screams. Finally we got on the ride and it was on the ride and it was insane, so waiting for those minutes that seemed like hours was rewarded with a thrilling experience.
1073	19022	7	3	"One time I was at the @ORGANIZATION1 thru. We had already got our food and we were waiting to get it so we could eat. We waited for about ten minutes at the pickup counter. Then finally our food came! We looked at the food they gave us and we got all the wrong food and no drinks. So my mom had to give it all back to them and explain the mistake. We had to wait about fifteen minutes this time for them to correct the order. So we waited and waited and waited, feeling quite hungry. Finally they gave us our food and this time we got the store we ordered. We finally left @ORGANIZATION2 and we got to eat our food. Also we got ice cream after we ate. ""@CAPS1 the good thing is you guys were so patience. Thank you guys for being good!"" is what my mom said to us wen we got home. that is how I was patience."
1074	19023	7	3	(waiting) (healt beatina ) “@CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is your repolt cords”. said @PERSON2hemlock. I @PERSON1 was the last one in line. “@CAPS3 you go @PERSON1 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12, keepup the good work!” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS4!!!!” I said screaming happily I ran home going straitght A’@CAPS12” “@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @PERSON1.” @CAPS7 mom aya said . I called @CAPS7 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 saying, “@CAPS9. I @CAPS10 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12! but can I older something from the internet for @MONEY1?” “@CAPS13 why not for a @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12 tudent. I placed @CAPS7 order and I waited @NUM1 week for the package to arrive, checking the mailbox every single day.
1075	19024	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to a skate compition in @CAPS1 the registration line was almost by @CAPS2. I stood there for almost an hour, slowly moving forward with my board. The sun was hot and I really wanted to get to the park, but I stayed calm. When I finally got up there & paid my fee it was all worth it because I got to compete against my best friends and have a great time.
1076	19025	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the sixteenth birthday bash where I used to live. I was waiting in a line that stretched out like a mile long, a seemingly endless snake of people. I waited and waited, shuffling forward inch by inch. Finally, I got close to the front, the music and laughter from inside the party just audible. It was then I went to look for my ticket and realized with a sinking feeling I had forgotten it, leaving it behind in the car. So I had to go all the way back through the parking lot to retrieve it. By the time I got back, the line had grown, having doubled in size and become twice as big as before. Then I had to wait some more, and it truly sucked. Then, as if things weren't bad enough, out of nowhere it started raining, a cold, steady drizzle. I didn't have an umbrella, so I just stood there, getting wetter and wetter, still waiting. I wondered, how could it possibly get any worse? Well, somehow over it did, as they eventually shut down the entire concert due to the weather. Defeated, I went home soaking wet, my feet and hands cold and pruned. There was nothing left to do, so I just lay down to go to sleep and relax, trying to forget the whole ordeal. P.S., it was the worst day of my life.
1077	19026	7	3	I, for one, have very little patience. I mean nearly none at all. When I am forced to wait, I get this weird, restless feeling, an agitation that crawls under my skin almost like a persistent tooth ache. Weird, huh? Well, you get the picture, so let me tell you a story about a time I completely lost my patience. It was a humid Tuesday in July, I was at my mandatory hunter safety course put on by the state wildlife department. We had just finished up taking the final written test that determined success, or failure, in the entire course. The instructors came outside with the first group of peoples' names who had passed, along with their official certificates. By the way, everyone was outside waiting on the grassy field. The first group's ceremony was done in about fifteen minutes. It had taken them about twenty minutes to grade the tests and another five to formally give out the awards. Unfortunately, my group was called last. We all sat on a hard, wooden bench for what felt like three hours! My patience completely wore off, and I just started rocking back and forth, back and forth out of sheer boredom and frustration. Eventually, my group finally got called up and we received our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a little better since that long afternoon. I did pass the course and am on my way to becoming a good and responsible hunter. I've since shot a partridge, and one six point buck. That is my story, have a good night!
1078	19027	7	3	I have to be patient when I’m taking the state mandated standardized tests at school. I’m patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their own state mandated standardized tests. I sometimes have to wait forever for the slowest test-takers to put their pencils down. But that’s fine, I can just put my head down and take a short nap at my desk. I sometimes hate being patient, though. It just frustrates me to no end. Waiting for like forty-five minutes just for people to finish a simple test feels like an eternity. It’s good, I suppose, because you really shouldn’t rush on the important state tests. It just frustrates me that some people take so incredibly long. This isn’t just a problem at school; it’s at my house too. I have to be patient at the doctor's office, the dentist, while waiting for a friend at their house, and even at the public library. Man, this is so hard for me, to be so patient all the time. But I know it’s not good to be impatient and rude to others. I often wish people were as fast as I am during a test. Then I wouldn’t have to be very patient and could just get on with my day. Oh well, I guess I’m just going to have to deal with it, man, this really stinks, being so patient.
1079	19028	7	3	Patience is a truly good thing to have in life. Good things often come from practicing patience, and bad things tend not to happen as a result. But what exactly is patience? Patience is being able to handle problems and delays without whining and complaining about them constantly. Patience is being able to wait calmly while others around you simply can’t. Some people are naturally very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so, he had been diligently saving up his extra money for a new television. Once he had finally saved enough, he immediately went out and got a new forty-two inch flat screen television. However, if he had waited only about another single week, he could’ve gotten a model about a foot bigger for the exact same price during a major sale. Let’s say your little sister is incessantly bagging you and you ask her nicely to stop, but she just won’t listen. So instead of totally flipping out on her, which will undoubtedly get you into tons of trouble, you can just patiently wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you don't, which is the wiser outcome.
1080	19029	7	3	"Once upon a time there was a girl named Ella. She had always dreamed of one day being a real princess. Every birthday or holiday present she ever got was either a fancy dress or a piece of shiny jewelry. She absolutely loved to try on different dresses in front of her mirror. She had two sisters, both a year older than Ella; their names were Grace and Anna. Their house is an old, charming house located deep in the woods. One day Ella went out to the end of the driveway to get the mail, and a man dressed in a fine tuxedo gave her a letter that looked very fancy and important. Ella carefully opened the letter and read it aloud, it said “Dear Ella, you are invited to a royal ball at the king's castle on the night of the harvest moon at eight pm.” Ella screamed in pure excitement. Ella decided to go to the mall immediately to look for a perfect ball gown. She found a beautiful, sparkling gown but it was far too much money. She asked the kind lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price if she helped around the store for a couple of days. The lady agreed, and Ella accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours, sweeping and organizing for two full days. And finally, her patience paid off. She was allowed to take the gorgeous dress home. She drove home and quickly put the dress on. She only had an hour before the ball, so she had to hurry. She put her makeup and best jewelry on and looked at her self in the mirror and said with a smile, ""I did it."" She got in the car and drove to the castle, which was so beautiful with the way the moonlight hit the gold paint on the gates. Ella got out of the car and walked inside the grand castle. She walked down the wide staircase and every one stared in awe. It was Ella's best day of her life to have everyone think she was so beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with several handsome guys. Then the prince himself came up to introduce him self and when she turned around, he immediately fell in love. Ella couldn’t believe the prince had talked to her, of all people. He asked her to dance with him. They danced together all night long. When the prince later went on the stage, he called her name and she nervously went on stage beside him. He asked her, ""will you marry me?"" and without hesitation, she said yes. She had finally become a real princess, proving that sometimes dreams really do come true if you are patient and work for them."
1081	19030	7	3	"One time when I had to be patient was when I had to babysit. My family friend has a one-year-old baby, and I have a six-year-old brother. I had to babysit both of them because my mom and her boyfriend were going to have a double date with our family friends. Things were great until they left. My brother was in preschool at the time, and they gave him these paper books and worksheets to do, and I had to help him. I thought, ""Okay, this will be easy."" I had him read the book, and my mom told me that he knows the words, so I wouldn’t have to sound out every single one. I had to, but he wouldn’t do the work, and the baby wouldn’t quit crying, and the dog wouldn’t stop barking (he hates when babies cry), and the house was crazy! I started to panic. What was I supposed to do? I didn’t want to ruin my mom's plans, and I definitely wanted to prove her wrong. I calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said; he told me to be patient. I let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First, I read the book aloud; it got both of their attention. Then I told him, and I made a game out of doing the work, and it was all good. Then dinner time came. I made some food that we all liked and set the baby in his high chair with his food and gave my brother his plate. I turned around, and he threw his plate at me, and food was everywhere! I got mad and told myself, ""Be patient."" I cleaned up the mess and fed the kids and put in a movie, and they all fell asleep! I quietly cleaned up the house, and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised I did it. Patience is a big part of life; if you lose your temper, it just makes things worse. Learning to stay calm in chaos is a valuable lesson for anyone."
1082	19031	7	3	"One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said, ""Honey, do you want to go shopping for your clothes now or later?"" I chose now. So my mom changed her clothes, and we were off to the store. It was around five o'clock, so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever, and I was getting mad. Then my mom said to be patient and that it would be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while, but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes, we were pulling up in the mall parking lot. There were a few cars in the lot, but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store, that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items led all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said, ""Now look. The lines are long, as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patience?"" ""I’ll try,"" I said. After we got in the store, we were looking for my clothes, and we were also looking at the long lines to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour's worth of time in the line, and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, but it made me hungry because I had skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to McDonald's. When we were down the street from McDonald's, there was this traffic line; we got closer and closer to McDonald's and then realized that line was the McDonald's line. We got in the lot, and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patience. So we waited, and the line went really fast. We got up to the speaker, and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window, and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said, ""Thank you for your patience."" Then she asked us if we would like a free fry of any size for our wait. We told her yes and that we would take a large fry. My mom turned to me and said, ""Do you see what happens if you are patient?"" I said yeah, and patience is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient, and it showed me how staying calm can lead to positive outcomes."
1083	19032	7	3	The time I was patient, I had trouble with football. I needed help doing everything, but my dad helped me. He taught me how to throw, kick, run, and carry the ball. I was patient because I watched him, and then I did it. I saw some people helping my dad play, so we went out to join them. The stuff he taught me was hard, but it helped me improve my skills over time. At first, I felt frustrated when I couldn't get the moves right, but my dad encouraged me to keep trying and not give up. I practiced repeatedly, focusing on each step he showed me, from holding the ball correctly to following through with a kick. Slowly, my throws became more accurate, and my runs became faster. Being patient allowed me to learn from my mistakes and gradually become better at the sport. It was a valuable lesson in perseverance and trusting the process of learning something new.
1084	19033	7	3	"Patience is probably one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probably like you more. For example, if you are in line for something at school and you were patient, you will probably get a ""thank you"" from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, whether or not it is at school, an amusement park ride's line in front of and behind a bunch of people. You will want to be patient because if you are not, you wouldn’t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the amusement park in front of all those people; then, you would be embarrassed. This is why I think patience is important. It helps you maintain your composure in frustrating situations and prevents you from acting impulsively. By waiting calmly, you show respect for others and avoid creating unnecessary conflicts or problems for yourself. Ultimately, practicing patience leads to better outcomes and a more positive reputation among your peers and authority figures."
1085	19034	7	3	"Fishing is a great sport, but it takes a lot of patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about ten miles from my home. I have loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasn't easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient; accomplishing what I did took every ounce of patience I had. When my uncle visits from out of state, he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a different way. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that I should bring a friend so that if I got bored, I would have someone to talk to. The patience started when we were about halfway there and bang! We hit a fence. The car had broken down, so we called a tow truck. The wait was about two hours and thirty minutes, and my friend asked, ""So are we there yet?"" and my friend sighed. We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way. Once we got there, we had two problems to fix: we had no bait and needed to find a good spot. We found a nice spot on the other side of the lake. We had to scavenge for some bait, which took about two hours to get enough. We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, set up the chairs, cast our lines, and waited. There was no way to make fishing faster, so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end, my uncle, my friend, and I caught five fish! We ate three for lunch and went home with two fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened, but we went fishing, relaxed, and brought home a couple of meals. That's why I love fishing because it requires patience and rewards you with a sense of peace and accomplishment."
1086	19035	7	3	One time when I was patient was my birthday; I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone and that’s all I wanted. All of my friends had them, and I just wanted one for practical reasons, like if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn’t know where I was. It is just a need right now because they are very helpful. My birthday was on a @DATE1, so the night before I was at the football game. Everybody was asking if I was going to get one, and I kept on telling them yes, I’m getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs, my heart full of anticipation. The first gift that I opened was the cell phone, and I was really happy. I immediately started to get all of my friends' numbers, feeling a great sense of joy and connection. I learned that when you are patient and not constantly asking, you will often get what you want in the end.
1087	19036	7	3	One day me and my brother asked my dad to take us to GameStop so we could get a new game controller. He said he would in a little bit, so we waited patiently by riding our bikes for about fifteen minutes. Then we went swimming at the pool for a while, and after that, he still wasn't ready to go. So we decided to play with my dog, Macy, to pass the time. Finally, he was ready to go, so we went to GameStop to get the controller, but they didn't have it. We then went to @CAPS1 Booster, and they had it, so we got the controller and went home. We played the game on the new controller all afternoon, and that is how I was patient all day. And the best way to be patient is to keep yourself occupied for a long period of time.
1088	19037	7	3	My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept having mistakes with it. For example, they spelled her last name wrong, so it had to be called back and retyped. Every time they retyped it, they would make another mistake; this happened five times in a row. It takes a long time to process a check, and we needed the money to pay our bills so we wouldn’t get kicked out of our home. We also needed a new car and some new clothes. Our car was ready to break down, and our clothes we had outgrown. When my grandma finally got her check, we went straight out and got a brand new car and some new clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to redo it over five times; I know I wouldn't be able to be that patient without losing my temper.
1089	19038	7	3	The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right now, waiting for @CAPS1. I’m not a person who likes to be patient. When I want something, I want it that second. Christmas is my favorite holiday; there is so much good stuff about it. There are cookies, family, and presents. There is always a problem, and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient: you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily, and if they don’t wrap it very well, I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are almost yelling not to leave them unopened. Sometimes it seems like all holidays are like that. Well, I guess we all have to be patient about something; I’m being patient about @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and the Florida Gators. First, @ORGANIZATION1 has got to get out of the @CAPS5 bowl game thing, which requires a lot of patience from all the fans.
1090	19039	7	3	"Have you @CAPS1 ever seen someone with good patience? Well, I @CAPS1. My @CAPS5 neighbor just couldn’t wait till the soccer tryouts for score. He practiced all day, juggling, passing, and working on his moves. The day for tryouts finally came. He went and juggled, talked with the coach, showed off some moves, and then went home. ""It will be a couple of weeks to see if you're on the team or not,"" the coach @CAPS3. ""@CAPS2,"" @CAPS3 my @CAPS5, ""I can’t wait that long."" After he got back, he told me all about it. ""I @CAPS1 to wait a couple of weeks,"" he @CAPS3. So I told him about patience. The more you complain, I @CAPS3, the worse you will feel about your disappointment. So he went home and practiced a move he couldn’t quite make before. A few days later, I was walking outside when suddenly, ""@CAPS4!"" my @CAPS5 friend came screaming outside, saying, ""I made it!"" I just smiled as I @CAPS3, ""patience, patience works,"" feeling happy for my friend's success."
1091	19041	7	3	"One time that I was patient was when I was eight years old when I caught my first fish. Me and my dad went fishing on my uncle's boat. My dad stopped the boat where we were going to fish, and then he helped me put on my life jacket. After that, he baited my pole and then cast it out for me. My dad was catching them like crazy; in like the first hour he got about five fish. He told me to be “patient” and that it was my first time. So as my dad was reeling them in, I was sitting there waiting patiently. Then all of a sudden, my bobber went down. I yelled out to my dad, and he said, ""Reel it in!"" I tried and tried and almost fell off the boat. My dad came over and helped me, and when we got it on the boat, I asked my dad what kind of fish it was. He said it was a bluegill and that it was a good catch for a first-timer. So me and my dad released it and went back to fishing. That was a time where I had to be patient, and it was worth the wait."
1092	19042	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient at my old school, before this school. I was patient all the time. On some occasions, a couple of people tried to jump me. I told them to go on, and then they wanted to fight. So I was holding my patience in while the teachers were talking to them about the situation. Later, I saw them outside of the school, and they did not do anything to me. I realized then that they were only fighting to make the school happy or to cause trouble, and my patience helped me avoid a bigger problem.
1093	19044	7	3	Patience is something everyone knows about, and it is how we all can stay focused. It is like if we are waiting in an unemployment line; we wait because patience keeps us from getting angry. But if we are waiting for a long time, that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait, you also show care, acknowledging the person in front of you. You wait and wait until it is your turn, because waiting and being patient lets you absorb the things around you and look at things you have never seen before in your whole life. You can study what you saw to understand it, even if you already know it. When you are patient, you show gratitude to the person in front of you, and gratitude shows respect and trustworthiness. That is a way of being polite and patient with others. When you are patient, you do not have to rush anything because you have a lot of time, and you should not complain at all when you are trying to be patient. No matter how long you are patient, the maximum time is for you, and you can make that time feel faster by not being impatient. Patience is a big thing because it often gives you what you want or need, given enough time. I think patience is important because you never know who is patient with you, so you should be patient with someone else.
1094	19046	7	3	The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait two years to get the film out of my camera. My mom always promised me to get the film, but since her money was used on other things, she told me to wait a little longer. So I waited, and the time had come up. This is what happened: I asked my mom again if I could get my film out of my camera. She said no because she used her money on school supplies. I had to wait another few months. So when that time came again, I asked her, and she said no because once again she spent her money on paying people back for helping her out, like my dad. So I had to wait until the next school year. I waited and waited, and finally the new school year had passed, and she forgot. She had to get groceries, so I asked her one more time and she said yes, but she had to pay my dad back for helping her first. After that, she said after school she would bring my film out to be developed. So I have now told you how long I waited to do that; I also had to get a new digital camera because the old one had been dropped too many times during the long wait.
1095	19047	7	3	Every day at lunch I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especially when you are waiting in a long line, you really have to be patient. But sometimes you are lucky and you can go to the other, shorter line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch, you can go outside to ride and play. But remember, you must finish your food and throw it away and wait patiently for your turn to be dismissed. And that is a time when I was patient during my school day.
1096	19048	7	3	I was patient in a plane ride going to @LOCATION1. All I did was stare at towers and buildings as I passed by them, watching the world shrink below. I was also patient when my little brother got a fly shot and I had to wait in the lobby for what felt like an eternity. The biggest time I’ve ever been patient was with my brother and him going through my things, breaking all my stuff, biting me with his toys and his constant whining or crying over stuff that he wants. Each day was a new test of my composure, a quiet battle against frustration. In the end, I learned that patience is a quiet strength, built one deep breath at a time.
1097	19049	7	3	During the @DATE1 my family and I went to @LOCATION3 for a couple weeks. In the beginning of the second week I did something I have never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), dad, cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2’s uncle (@CAPS1) and I were on our way to the boat. I was excited, this was my first time fishing in an ocean. A few hours past and we didn’t catch anything, but we still waited while drinking coffee, telling jokes, doing little pranks like pulling each others line to make them think we caught something. We left at @NUM1 am and now it was @NUM2 pm. We still didn't catch anything but dad and @CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just had to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling; @CAPS1 helps her reel it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home we told everyone what we caught, which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldn't last on that boat for an hour. So I was proud of how patient everyone was and I hope to do it again next time I go to @LOCATION2 with my family, remembering the quiet camaraderie of our long day on the water.
1098	19050	7	3	Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a goal and you're not patient, you might not wait your turn and they are not going to hire you; they are not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 but we had to leave at @DATE1 am so I couldn’t go to sleep. I woke up at @TIME1am so I was tired. I couldn’t take a nap because if I did the nap would turn into a deep sleep. Next I had to finish packing my suitcase so I was really tired and the clock was slow because it was an hour left. When I was done packing, I started to watch t.v to keep me awake because I can’t go to sleep under a blanket. Then my cousin had to have his diaper changed so I was to change it, but @CAPS1 when I was just about to get the wipes my mom called out and said “let’s go.” I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van. In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when you're really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diaper but some how I maintained my patience and learned the value of composure.
1099	19051	7	3	"One beautiful day in summer, my sister and I were outside @CAPS1. My mom said that she'd be right back. She's going to the store but a couple hours later she is not back with a gift. She said @CAPS2 was for my sister but she said we couldn't open @CAPS2 till her birthday. Her birthday was in a couple of weeks. She said she couldn't wait that long and stormed off. After a couple of days she decided to be patient. She thought days would go by quickly. They did to her surprise, but not fast enough. My mom told her to try to be patient and to just forget about the box. @CAPS2 is hard for her to ignore that it was in the house. I was going to help her. I had decided to distract her. We got some ice cream and sang on the way home. Finally @CAPS2 was her birthday and she was excited. She had opened all of her gifts except one. The box was sitting in front of her. She dosed over to it and ripped @CAPS2 open. When she opened @CAPS2, she just stared. In the break of silence she said, ""@CAPS2's just clothes"". I could tell she didn't like @CAPS2. ""I can't believe I was patient for so long for clothes."" I bursted out in laughter. I thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. After I stopped laughing she told me don't get used to me being patient because you might never see it again."
1100	19052	7	3	Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just can’t control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “Aww!” everyone screamed. “Can I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “You are being so patient, you can be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient can pay off in the most wonderful ways.
1101	19054	7	3	I was patient when I was at my friend’s house in the winter shoveling a sledding slot so we could pour water on it to make ice. When we were shoveling it was hard because we had to get through lots of deep, fluffy snow just to get to a nice, compact layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient guy when we do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient and that it would be worth it. The only reason I was losing my patience was because it was getting dark and I had to go home soon. But before I became impatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail finished. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice, but that didn’t bother me at all since the hard work was over. That’s how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But… I couldn’t or we couldn’t go on it that night because it was too late for me to stay. I guess that’s my story about patience. The @CAPS1.
1102	19055	7	3	Patience is an important part of life and I learned that @DATE1 during hunting season. Most of the @DATE1 we sat and saw everything but deer, like squirrels and birds. We were getting to the point where we didn’t want to go anymore but we did anyways, hoping our luck would change. As the days went by and it got colder we started to see some does in the distance. My step dad @PERSON1 said we will shoot one on the @DATE2 if we don't see any bucks by then. After a few days it was the @DATE2 and we were going to shoot a doe but we didn't see anything for most of the @DATE2, which was very frustrating. When there was about @NUM1 minutes left of @DATE2 light, just as we were about to give up, the perfect buck walked into the field, making all our waiting worthwhile.
1103	19056	7	3	One day me, my mom, and my brother were driving in our car. We were going to a beach when suddenly our car wouldn't move forward anymore. The battery had been run down and didn't work at all. My mom called a tow truck and the person on the phone said he wouldn't be here for two whole hours! Me and my brother complained all the time about the heat and the wait, but my mom just sat quietly, looking calm. So when the truck (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3) finally got to us, we were able to go home. I was amazed by my mom's patience throughout the whole long, hot wait, and I learned a lot from watching her that day.
1104	19057	7	3	One time I was on my way to the bus stop, and I had got there @NUM1 minutes before the bus came so I sat there and waited. I looked at my watch and it was @NUM2 minutes past the time I was supposed to get picked up, so I waited and waited some more. Then I looked at my watch again and it was @NUM3 minutes past the time I was supposed to be on the bus. So I was growing impatient, but I had thought, well, buses are sometimes late. I sat back down and I waited because I was going to be late if I didn't, and I grew very patient and calm. After @NUM4 more minutes the bus had finally came, and it had let me on free because I was the only person who had stayed at the stop. So when I got back home my mom asked me how did it go, I said the bus was late @NUM5 minutes. She said what did you do, I said I waited and they let me on free. She said that is what you get for being patient, a free ride and a clear conscience.
1105	19058	7	3	I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a popular ride. I was becoming impatient just waiting there, shifting my weight from foot to foot. But suddenly I saw the line move forward a little. So then I calmed down and waited more patiently, and eventually it was our turn to ride. I just realized it was an hour we had been waiting in that long line. Understanding patience means you know why you have to stand there waiting your turn. Because you can’t push or shove your way to the front of the line; that wouldn't be fair. Tolerance means you can’t do or get whatever you want unless you wait your turn properly. You can’t hit, cut, push, or shove to the front of the line, you just have to wait calmly until it is finally your time.
1106	19059	7	3	"Being patient requires a lot of tolerance and inner strength. For most people, it's hard to be patient but sometimes it is very important. A few weeks ago my neighbor really needed a break from her two-year-old daughter, Chloe. I gladly offered to babysit because I love being with her. I definitely didn't know what I was in for. She came over at around noon and we played for hours. But then she got cranky. I gave her a snack but that didn't help. She started crying so loudly I had no idea what to do. My mom came rushing into the room in panic mode. ""What's going on? Is everything okay in here?"" she asked. I told her that everything was fine but Chloe was just really cranky. My mom replied, ""Let's take her to the park; she will have fun there!"" I agreed and off we went. I noticed Chloe likes to do things herself. She insisted on getting into her car seat alone, getting on the swings by herself and putting together puzzles without help. That requires a ton of patience because she takes forever to complete each task. I love watching Chloe, but if I didn't have patience, it would be extremely difficult to handle such situations gracefully. The experience truly showed me the value of staying calm."
1107	19060	7	3	It takes immense patience when you are out hunting. After about three deer seasons, my patience finally paid off. I was using a bow and a six-point buck walked out. He was about forty yards from my stand and I called him closer with a soft grunt. Then he was only twenty yards from my stand, well within range. I took the shot and he buckled immediately; the ten minutes I waited to find him felt like an entire lifetime. Then I got out of my stand and tracked him; he had run about fifty yards and dropped. When I got to him, I was so excited and surprised because he wasn't a six-point after all; he was a massive eight-point buck. I will always remember to use the right broadhead and, most importantly, to be patient, because you could shoot the deer of a lifetime if you just wait for the right moment. That day was a perfect testament to a hunter's reward for perseverance.
1108	19061	7	3	This is a story about the virtue of patience. Patience is profoundly needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience to see you through. One reason is if someone or something gets you mad, you need patience or you can get into serious trouble. For example, if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you’ll get in huge trouble at school or with the law. Or if you try doing a difficult task and you can’t, you need patience or you might break something in anger and get in trouble for the damage. Another reason for patience is if you are working with a partner or teaching someone, you need patience so you don’t hurt their feelings if they can’t do something right the first time. They might get discouraged and not want to be with you anymore. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him or her. Just ignore the person or walk away so you both don’t get into a conflict. If you wouldn’t have patience, things could end drastically for everyone involved. So that is why you should always have patience. Without it, you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong in your life. That’s precisely why you need to cultivate patience in your daily actions.
1109	19062	7	3	I have a lot of patience, and for example, I really wanted to know if I made the volleyball team, and I had patience, I did not complain or pester the coach. I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others around you. Once I had a difficult test and really wanted to know when we were going to receive our grades back, but I had patience and waited quietly. Others in my class did not have patience; they kept asking the teacher what we are going to get and when, and they were constantly complaining about the delay. Another example is when we were going to go to the state fair on the last day of summer, and we still hadn't planned the specific day. I did not have a ruler for that project at that time, and it made it worse; leaving the patience behind, the more I thought about it, the more it made the waiting difficult. I've learned that sometimes you need more patience, and sometimes not so much, but it is always a valuable skill to have. Practicing patience leads to better outcomes and less stress for everyone.
1110	19063	7	3	I woke up at around 3 am not feeling very good. I was staying at my friend Sarah's house for a sleepover. I tried to wait it out until she woke up on her own, but I just couldn't wait any longer so I gently woke her up. I told her I wanted to go home and that I felt sick, so I called my mom, and in about twenty minutes my mom had come to pick me up. I told her in the car that I thought I was going to be sick. I had to wait and wait, feeling worse with every minute, until finally we got home; it took about two hours from the time I first felt ill until I finally threw up. It was a horrible and uncomfortable experience that required all the patience I could muster just to get through the night. The ordeal taught me that sometimes, even when you feel terrible, you have no choice but to endure and wait for relief to come.
1111	19064	7	3	My mom has a great deal of patience with me and my brother, especially with all the fighting going on in our neighborhood. People are getting killed around here, and she doesn't like us going out to places with all that violence going on. She worries constantly and insists that we come home early, never wanting us to be out late when such dangers are present. Her concern is a constant reminder of the need for caution in our daily lives.
1112	19065	7	3	There was a time that I didn’t want to be patient but had to be. We as a family were going to go to my grandmother's house for a holiday. On the way, while we were on the highway, about two hundred yards ahead of us, two cars had collided and both pulled over. They were beside the road, and the drivers were standing outside with anger, shouting at one another. Soon after that the cops came. Keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this, stuck in the growing traffic. The cops investigated everything and called in for a tow truck. Thirty minutes later a truck came around the traffic jam and started fixing the road, though I don’t know why since there was nothing obvious to be fixed. Finally, around an hour later we were let past, and we continued our ride to our destination, the delay a test of our patience that we had no choice but to endure.
1113	19068	7	3	Lots of people are good at being patient, but I’m not so good at it. However, when you're traveling a long distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my grandmother’s house. She lives about four hours away, near the coast. My grandmother loves when family visits, so we don’t mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. I’ve had to have been there at least twenty times in my lifetime. My mom works the night shift at a well-known hardware store. Usually, she works ten PM to six AM. So when she gets off work, we would pack up and leave. I always bring my headphones with me to keep me entertained, but most of the time I just sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot, so I put in my headphones and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs loudly. Until, my headphones died. I felt my heart break a little, and I couldn’t fall asleep then. I was still hyper, so I started listening to the radio, but all we could find was country music. Since we were going north, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached “The Up North Store” where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to grandmother’s. I got some chips and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. Back in the car, I finished my food and was bored once again; there was simply nothing to do. I was angry at that point, so I just looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the driveway, and my grandmother running out to come greet us. Finally, we were there, and I had survived yet another long ride to my grandmother’s house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, I’m almost positive I will never stop getting bored during the ride. Being patient is simply not one of my favorite things to do.
1114	19069	7	3	I really wanted to go see a movie, but there were no movies here at home that I wanted to see. “Hey dad, can I go to the movies with someone?” I asked. “Sure!” my dad answered. I looked up what movies were playing, and there was a pretty good selection at the theater in the next town over. I picked the movie I wanted to see, but then I realized I needed someone to go with me. I called up my friend Sarah and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I had chosen. It ended up she wanted to see it too, so she said yes. After that, I got something to eat and relaxed for a little while. All of a sudden, it was time to leave and I was running behind. I got ready really quickly and went to pick up Sarah. Unlike me, she was completely calm and patient, already waiting outside. In her place, I wouldn’t have been so calm, and that’s one of the reasons why I like Sarah as a friend; her patience balances out my impulsiveness.
1115	19070	7	3	Do you have patience? I have very little patience; I will not wait for anything for long. When you have patience, you have to wait on what you want, or need, which is something I find incredibly difficult to do. It is a virtue that does not come easily to me, and I often struggle with the quiet stillness that waiting requires. This is a challenge I continue to face in my daily life.
1116	19071	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the glasses place for an eye exam. I had to get approved to get glasses, which involved a check-up and a vision test. So the next day my grandma called and asked did I get approved and they said “yes,” my grandma then asked how long do I have to wait and they said four weeks. So a week went by and surprisingly they called and said my glasses were done already. So the next day we went and got them and that was a time I was patient, waiting for something I needed.
1117	19072	7	3	“Again!” I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer, a move that is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldn’t land it properly. My gymnastics coach has been very patient with me; he has been working with me for about a month on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, as he is like a brother to me. His name is Coach, and I have known him since third grade. Whenever he sees me he says “my baby!” and gives me a hug and a kiss on the forehead. He can do many amazing things, having competed many times himself. He taught me my back handspring, the very first trick I ever learned. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesn’t, because I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad, and I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you finally get it for him. “Again!” I fell on my butt, again. This time, instead of the normal, enthusiastic “try again,” his tone was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor, my adrenaline pulsing through me. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped, everything felt good. I did the trick, and I landed! For about a second anyway, before my feet slipped out from under me. He came running to me smiling, proud of me even though I didn’t stick the landing perfectly. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for him.
1118	19073	7	3	Last year my mom ordered a special video game for me and I was patient for an entire year. One year, few months and four months and five months to be exact. Why? Well, the game came out this year, on its release date and I had to wait for it. How did I pass the time? Simple, I tried not to think about the game, I tried not to talk about the game and I only wrote about when it would come out on my daily calendars. Even though I had already beaten the game exactly thirty-two times on every difficulty in my mind without any help, I still had to wait for another month or so for the next game I wanted. So this, ah, stinks because now I can’t stop thinking about it, but the wait is almost over.
1119	19076	7	3	Everyone should have patience. Living with patience will help you because you're going to have to be patient sometimes. Some people can be patient and some people can't be patient, and which I am one of these people. Quite sometime I can be patient and sometimes I can't be patient. Being patient was a hard thing for me to overcome, and well, I didn't for the most part! But for once I was patient in my life. That time was when a lot of elderly people were coming through a heavy door and I finally held the door for all of them. It wasn't easy because I had to be at a doctor's appointment in about ten minutes and there was a lot of them. It took about almost fifteen minutes to wait for all of them to get slowly through the door. But I still continued holding the door open patiently. After holding the door I was late for my appointment but it was still the right thing to do, a common act of kindness.
1120	19077	7	3	One time I was patient was last year when I was at an amusement park in a place called Cedar Point. I was standing in a very long line to get on an amazing rollercoaster called the Millennium Force. It was a very tough ride to wait for and definitely thrilling, but the line was ten hours long. Standing in the hot, unbearable line was horrid and it hurt my feet, which is usually how it is in amusement parks, but I remained patient until it was finally my turn to ride.
1121	19078	7	3	When I went to get my new phone I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a specific person and will not accept help from anyone else. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and me were waiting for finally came to us so we went to the phase I wanted, which was looking at the phones, and he was talking for a long time about plans and features. My grandma said if I wasn’t patient I wouldn’t get my new phone that day, so I tried my best to wait quietly. We make it up to the counter and he’s showing thing about the phone, like how to set it up, but I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself and figure it out. Me and my grandma finally leave the store and I have my new phone with me and I like it very much. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!
1122	19079	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the doctors. The doctor took too long and I was patient and I was patient for the doctor to come back to the room. I was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and my mom and I go to the doctors because I had an apontment for a check-up. I got their and the doctor call me and took me to a room and like @NUM1 mins later he came back after we had already been waiting. All of that time we were waiting me and my mom were talking things about school and my friends. I like what is takeing so long and my mom said I don’t know but just wait, he will be here soon. Then the doctor comes and starts asking me quatons like what I eat, and what I do for exersi and say. I don’t know how to answer some of them. Then after they stepsesling the quatons they say sorry for keeping you patient and give my mom some papers then we go down stairs and I had to go to a lab to take my blood. Their was a lot of people sitting in the chairs and I was patient then they call me down and take my blood that was a time when I was patient with my mom at the doctors.
1123	19080	7	3	We’ll I’m patient and I’m in the middle patience is all about waiting or juss sitting with someone you don’t like. One time when I was little I was not very patient at all. My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say @NUM1 right away because I couldn't wait. But when I got older I was more patient in many situations. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens when I am tired. I love having someone to talk to but some times I can’t talk to them because I’m unpatient and want to do other things. My friends are really good about it first though some time they don’t understand, my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him I don’t really talk to my dad though. Although I’m unpatient I’m really out going and funny with people. I have a lot of friends because I’m outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because I’m outgoing and that has a blown side to it. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun for everyone. I working on my patience every day. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment. In conclusion I need more patience but patiuence is a thing I can defiatly work on and improve over time.
1124	19081	7	3	Patience. Wow, you want critism; are you sure? We’ll since you asked for it, it looks like I’m have to give it to you. Patience is @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need it every single day (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We about need it every day.) @CAPS2 does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant of delays or problems. Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining or getting upset. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until @CAPS2 you want is done, even if it takes a while. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be, especially when I am excited. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so you’ll have to learn patience and wait your turn. That is one word I do not like @CAPS1 when its something I really want right now.so that is my story about patience explained my way and what it means to me.
1125	19082	7	3	A time I have to have patience some times is in class I have to have patience with my teacher. I don’t have a lot of patiences in general, but I try in school. I have to have patiences in @NUM1 block, which is my first class. @NUM1 block is moth and it is very long. We as the students have @PERSON1 who is our teacher. @PERSON2 talks all the time during the lesson, explaining things over and over. He talks till luch wich is about for a half an hour, so the class feels very long. So I have to wait for a while till he gives us work to do on our own. That how I have patiences, by sitting quietly and listening. To conclude that when I have to have patience in class is during that long math period. Though I don’t have a lot of patience at all, but in class I do manage to find some when it is needed.
1126	19083	7	3	"""We're gonna be late!"" yelled my baby cousin Madison from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on, all bundled up and ready for the snow. She began to jump around in her excitement, her little boots thumping on the floor, and it made me laugh easily. You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parents, my cousin Madison, and her parents. I was ecstatic. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to Madison’s parents about the travel route before we left, so Madison was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to distract her. ""Madison, do you want to play I Spy?"" I asked safely, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seemed to grow twice their size. ""Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!"" Madison yelled, her impatience forgotten. Though she made it sound like ""I py,"" I smiled and we began to play. She would guess silly things, like the color of the rug or a lamp, and I would let her win. She was so happy and giggly, and I think I made her more patient to leave by helping her play a game. Finally my parents walked outside and we began our ski trip. Patience had paid off."
1127	19084	7	3	"One time I was patient when my little brother was taking a shower and I had to go to the bathroom. So I waited, hopping from one foot to the other, and of course he had locked the door. I tried to pick the lock with a toothpick, jiggling it around, but it didn’t work. Then I told my dad and he said, ""be a man, you can hold it in,"" so that didn’t work either. My patience was wearing very thin. I was just about to take the door off the hinges with a screwdriver I had found when he walked right out and smiled at me, all clean and refreshed. So then I went in the bathroom and it was soaked in water, with puddles all over the floor and a wet towel in the sink. I yelled at him for making such a mess, and that’s when I was patient, because I didn't actually dismantle the door."
1128	19085	7	3	I’m always having to be patient. It’s because I have an older brother that doesn’t do what he is told. Let’s say my dad tells him to clean the bathroom, well it takes him ten minutes just to get up from the couch, and then he moves so slowly. I have to go when he’s cleaning and he won’t let me in, so I just have to wait. So that’s one of the reasons I need patience. Another is my older sister; she’s always on the phone, talking for hours with her friends. So I barely ever get to use it when I need to. I wait until my parents get home so they yell at her to get off, and then I can finally make my call. That’s why I’m very patient, from all this daily practice.
1129	19086	7	3	"It was Christmas morning and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank my hot chocolate. I saw our Christmas tree; it was full of presents, and I couldn’t wait till I could open them. I’ve been wanting a Wii since last year, but I never got one. But that didn’t stop me from hoping. So I wished I got one this year. After a while my parents said we could open our gifts. ""Finally!"" I screamed, and I quickly tore the paper off the presents. I saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more nice things. But not a Wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if we could buy the Wii tomorrow. But she replied, ""We can't afford it right now. We will buy it when we get enough money."" Well, I was very patient, so I guess I could wait. As we all enjoyed our Christmas, we watched tv together. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said we could go out and buy the Wii. ""Thank you, mom,"" I screamed. When we arrived at the store, I got the Wii and it cost a lot, which was two hundred dollars. I couldn’t believe it; my patience finally paid off. Now I got my new Wii, and I am enjoying every second of it."
1130	19087	7	3	A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my grandmother is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in a time when she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldn’t just go out and buy food at the grocery store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food from scratch. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn kernels then put them into a heavy pan, then start a fire on the stove and who knows how long that could take to get hot enough. Then finally she had to wait for the kernels to pop, shaking the pan carefully. That is way harder than putting a bag in the microwave and pushing a button. That is how she is also filled with patience even with me, never rushing me when I tell her a long story. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world.
1131	19089	7	3	Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with; if you are impatient, then people will say that you are impatient and that you need to calm down. Being patient also means that you are a polite person and that you will not complain about anything, and also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his or her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for little children or kids. You are setting an example and being considerate of others around you, showing them how to behave calmly. These are many reasons on why being patient takes understanding, and being considerate of the people and the situation you are in.
1132	19090	7	3	My brother and I have been asking for a dog for a while; every month, mom and dad said we were going to get one, but every month we got a fish instead. Mom would look online for dogs, and dad would look through the paper for any listings. Colin and I told them daily that we would feed it, walk it, and give it water. The month of my birthday, like ten days before the twenty-first, they said that we were getting a dog tomorrow! It was at ten o'clock at night, so we couldn't fall asleep because we were so happy and excited. The next morning, around nine, we got in the car; mom said the place was in Howell, so it couldn't be that far. Colin and I were so happy. We got to the house and there were five dogs, small fluffy dogs, one white and six black. I told my mom I wanted the white one; she told me it was up to dad, and dad loved her, so that means we got her. We named her Vary Patient, and our patience wore off, but it was well worth it in the end.
1133	19091	7	3	A warrior named Arthur was waiting patiently for his sword; he was waiting for an hour. He just sat quietly while everyone around him was yelling and running about. He was happy and calm. All he could think of was his new sword. He loved swords so much and had twenty of them already. So he was patient, waiting to get his special sword. Then he battled ninjas who had appeared suddenly. He went after the ninjas because they took a boy named Peter. Then he turned them to dust with his powerful new sword, which was made of ancient magic. Then the warrior and Peter went to school together, where the warrior was the teacher and Peter was the student, learning about bravery.
1134	19092	7	3	My story of when I was patient was when my family and I were going to the Monster Jam. It was one of the most exciting things of my life, and I could not wait to see the huge trucks. But the trip there was almost two hours long, which felt like forever. Then it took half an hour to find a place to park in the crowded lot. Then at least twenty more minutes for my mom's friends to show up so we could all go in together. And finally, an hour standing in line just to get inside the stadium. Last but not least, fifteen minutes to find our seats in the huge arena! It was a long wait, but the show was amazing. Thank you for listening to my report about patience and sitting through it with me!
1135	19093	7	3	There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said, “Maybe not tonight,” because it was a school night. So I said, “Okay, I know it’s a school night,” but at least I said it with manners and loyalty, which made my mom happy. And that's a time I was loyal to someone. Here is another time when I stuck up for someone; well, my best friend was in a fight with this other girl, and it was in person. I went right up to my best friend’s enemy and said, “Why don’t you just go home and leave my friend alone?” and she backtalked me. Then finally, we started ignoring her, and then she left. That’s a time when I stuck up for my best friend while she was in a fight, showing her I had her back.
1136	19094	7	3	When I had to go to the doctor for my scheduled appointment, I had thought that I would be in front of the line. It was over @NUM1 people there in line when we got there, and more people was still coming in behind us. I had to get my shots, a requirement for school, so we had to wait patiently in the crowded waiting room. But my mom could not wait because it was so many people there in front of use, and she grew increasingly restless. So I fell asleep in my chair, tired from the long wait. She was still walking around, pacing back and forth near the rows of seats. So wen I woke up, five people had already gone by, called in by the nurse. She still could not be patient, still walking around making me nervous as she muttered under her breath, then another @NUM2 went by and its going really really slow, almost at a crawl. Then she finally cooled down and sat next to me. She was so patient because they said they was going to put her out if she caused any more disturbance. I have never seen her so patient it was no believable, sitting perfectly still until our turn finally came.
1137	19095	7	3	When I was in the sub line and in @NUM1 grade, I waited patiently for my turn to order. If you cut infront of me, I would not care much, as I believed in being polite. Than when I waited for @NUM2 minutes and the line was still big, not seeming to move forward, I started to feel a little restless. My patience meter went down after @NUM3 minutes of standing there, watching others get their food, and I finally got to get a sub, feeling a wave of relief. I waited @NUM4 minutes for a sub that is like waiting to get pizza at the busiest parlor in town. Once I got to the check-out center, ready to pay, I had no money in my account, so I was really angry, angry as in you not being paid any money for a year, and I had to leave empty-handed after all that waiting.
1138	19096	7	3	One time I was patient was when my brother broke his arm. I was a fine day and was playing outside on the play ground, during lunch resses, enjoying the sunshine. He said that he was on the monkey bars, trying to cross from one end to the other. His hands got all sweaty from the heat and he slipped, losing his grip completely. Eric fell on his arm, landing hard on the wood chips below. He screamed in pain, clutching his wrist. The resses ladies brought him to the office and called my parents, who were at work. Then my parents called my school to tell them they were picking me up so I could come along. They picked me up and then got my bother, whose face was pale and tear-streaked. We drove to the hospital and they did x-rays to see the damage. It took forever in the sterile, white waiting room. I sat there quietly for @NUM1 hours, reading old magazines and not complaining once! My parents told me that they appretiated now I was very patient and well-behaved during the stressful time. That the time I was patient when my family really needed me to be.
1139	19097	7	3	My story in own way about being patience is when there is like @NUM1 people in front of a line a ceter point, maybe at a theme park or a busy store. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you, so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that. You donít want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat, you have wait your turn in line so you donít get kick out and miss your chance. Similarly, on the popular rides you have to wait your turn so you donít get the secrety on you, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance to enjoy themselves.
1140	19098	7	3	A time when I was patient was fishing with my grandpa up north at his favorite lake. We were siting out there all day in the old aluminum boat, and we had to have trolled up and down the chanel at least @NUM1 times, searching for a good spot. And each time we got bites but we never caught any fish, they kept stealing our bait. We tried our usal routine with different lures but that wasnít working out so well, so I decided to change it up a bit out of frustration. I gave my grandpa the idea of turning the boat around and heading towda shigle bay, where I had seen some birds diving earlier. He agred but the only problem was there were a lot of rocks were we were going and thats the last thing we need is for the prop to get broken off, leaving us stranded. But we took our chances and modered or we to were were were I direted him to go, moving slowly through the shallow water. As soon as we enter the bag bam! We see the pale bend down so far it was hard to believe it was a fish, the line zipping out into the depths. So I got the net ready and my grandpa grabed the pole and started to real, working the fish carefully. We evently go it to the surface after a tough fight and it was a @NUM2î wallege, its green scales shimmering. We smiled at each other and said looks like were having fish to night, a well-earned meal. This is the story of when my patients were being tested by fish and then I caught the biggest one in the lake, a memory I will always cherish.
1141	19099	7	3	“Let’s go!” I said. We were in the waiting room of my dad’s doctor’s office. My dad goes to a special doctor. It was very boring. There also was a rummage sale going on, so my sister and I went and looked at that while my dad read a book. We were at the doctor’s for almost all morning. We were there for a long time! That was the most boring day of my life. The doctors were very slow and they were dumb, I told my dad while he was patient. There also was a rummage sale at the doctor's office that we went in. At the rummage sale they had dishes, food, jewelry, and clothing. My sister and I got a Rice Krispie treat. My sister also got a hat. Her hat was cool. I also got a shirt and it was blue, purple, pink, and sparkly. Finally, they called my dad. My dad went into a patient room. When my dad came out he said that he was healthy. He had to wait until they got his prescription ready to take and get filled. They gave him his prescription and we left. In conclusion, we should be patient with people. Patience is kindness. I am always patient with people. I hope you are also patient with people.
1142	19100	7	3	One day in the beginning of fall, Sarah was watching T.V. As she was watching, a commercial comes on and says that the final movie, of a very popular series, is coming to theaters tomorrow night. The next day of school, everyone was excited. They all couldn’t wait to see the movie that night. Finally the time came to go get the tickets. When Sarah got there, a huge line was already formed. Sarah was waiting, then she realized her best friend, Emily, was in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up in line. Her name was Chloe. She walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra money for a better seat and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made Chloe mad, and because she didn’t get in line when she got there, more people got in line. But all that time Sarah and Emily were talking. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But Chloe thought it took forever to get her tickets because she was not patient. The experience showed that patience makes waiting much easier.
1143	19101	7	3	I was patient when I went to Cedar Point. I had to wait in line a long time for the ride called the Dragster. There was a lot of people; it was the longest line for the Dragster. I had to wait almost an hour for a ride that lasted only a few seconds. That is the challenge of a popular roller coaster, but I remained calm and waited my turn. It was a good lesson in practicing patience.
1144	19102	7	3	One day my family and I all went to Adventure Point. I was so excited. When we arrived I rushed out the car. We got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on. We were gonna go on the Red Dragon. There was such a long line. It felt like it wasn’t even moving. I was as patient as can be. I was so excited to try this ride. The family finally moved up, step by step, and finally we were next. We all got in our seats and made sure we were buckled in nice and tight. The roller coaster was about a couple minutes long and it was worth the wait. That was the time I was patient, and it made the fun experience even better.
1145	19103	7	3	One Saturday afternoon I was at the local ice cream store, Frosty’s. The line was huge. There had to be over twenty people there and I was in the middle of the line sitting there waiting, thinking what I am going to get. One by one the workers took the orders. Until one short old lady hadn’t decided what she was going to get yet. I sat and waited as she blabbered on asking the prices, if it was sugar free, what toppings it had on it, and so on. Finally she ordered. I am at the front of the line and all of a sudden a group of people come up. I guess they were “holding their place in line”. There had to be five of them yelling at the person behind the glass like a rooster ship going off. Finally the order was done and I was up next. Just as I could talk, this sweet old lady asked “can I cut in front of you, dear?” I had to say yes; it wouldn’t be nice if I didn’t. That is my story about being patient, which is an important part of being kind to others.
1146	19104	7	3	My brother Matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated and visibly agitated whenever something or someone takes too long. We always have to have a great deal of patience with Matt, but that all changed one surprising day. Me, my mom, my nephew, Matt, and his girlfriend all decided to go get something to eat at a local diner. While we were there and waiting in line to be seated, I made a playful bet with Matt’s girlfriend. The bet was that however many impatient comments he said during the meal, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments at all, I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left, we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other daily things, while me and my nephew talked about school and other topics as well. That conversation took up at least a couple of minutes. For the last couple of minutes, we watched the football game that was going on the television above the bar. During those several minutes, including the couple of minutes when we were all talking, I did not hear Matt have one single impatient comment. I was really impressed by his unusual composure. I was, however, a little upset that I owed Matt’s girlfriend two dollars, but it was a small price to pay for such a pleasant surprise.
1147	19105	7	3	One time when I was patient, I went hunting with my mom. You have to have a lot of patience to do that, as it involves long periods of quiet waiting. When my mom and I were sitting in the deer blind, she was carefully getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came into view. But we were sitting there silently for about two hours without seeing anything. I was about to lose my patience, feeling restless and fidgety, but then some deer finally came in, a mother deer and her small fawn. My mom didn’t want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the young fawn would be all alone in the world and likely not survive. So we waited patiently for more deer to come in, hoping for a buck, but none did. But I still had my patience in me, determined to see it through. When it started to get cold and dark out, we thought no more deer were going to come in, so we just decided to pack up and go home, and plus my mom was starting to lose patience a little bit herself by that point. But that’s the time I was patient for a little while, and I felt proud of myself for it.
1148	19106	7	3	When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how incredibly tolerant and understanding she is with everyone. Even when she has explained a difficult math problem to me about five times and I still don’t understand, she helps me without complaining or showing any frustration. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. It was the first time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike with its training wheels recently taken off. My dad had told me that you needed to turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devastated that it wasn’t easy, I gave up a little bit after only a few attempts. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again, encouraging me with a soft voice. Holding on firmly to the back of the bike, she told me to pedal forward. She let go, and yelled, “turn! Turn!” but it was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over onto the soft grass. “It’s okay. You almost had it!” mom said rushing over to me and brushing off my knees. Putting on a brave face, I tried again, determined not to let her down. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike, wobbling and weaving across the lawn. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up each and every time I fell. On my one last try before it was time to go back in the house for dinner, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, shakily going around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little happy dances, my mom congratulated me with a huge hug, and we called my dad immediately to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed incredible patience that day. She didn’t let me give up and she never complained about the time it took. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that steadfast support, she taught me how to ride a bike!
1149	19107	7	3	You have got to try to be patient with homework; it is a necessary skill for learning. One time when I was doing my homework, I started to be impatient because I was having trouble with a particularly tricky math problem. I was sighing loudly and tapping my pencil, ready to give up. But then my dad came into the room and said he was going to help me, and he told me firmly to be patient and to calm down. So I sat there and sat, taking a few deep breaths as he had suggested. And I stayed patient as long as I could, trying to work it out in my head while I waited for his guidance, and then he finally helped me by walking me through the steps. I usually get impatient when it comes to homework or something like that, wanting to finish quickly. You really need to try your hardest to be patient, because it makes solving problems much easier in the end.
1150	19108	7	3	Everyone has been patient at one time of their life; it is a common experience. I know I certainly have. A year ago, my brother and I had a big school project to do that we both needed the family computer to finish. Since I was done with my part first, I let my brother go first to complete his section. Being that there is only one computer in the house, I knew I would have to wait for my turn. After a couple of hours, I checked in to see if my brother was close to being done, peeking into his room. He was not, he was still typing away slowly, but I had remembered at that moment that he was a very slow typer, which explained the long wait. He finally finished his part the next day, after working on it for a long time. I had no problem with it because I had planned ahead and still had lots of time to type my own paper before the deadline. This is the time I was patient, and it helped us both get our work done without any arguments.
1151	19109	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait @NUM1 hours till we got to camp, a long and tedious journey. I mostly slept and ate the snacks we had packed, we also watched movies on @PERSON1 @CAPS1 player to help pass the time. We finally got their, but I had to wait some more for registration in a long, slow-moving line, and I had to wait till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin without it getting soaked. Next we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friend, or last read in your cabin. When the bell rang we all went into the program center and waited for chapel to end, which felt like an eternity. We had a lot of patients by the end of the week, having practiced it so much. Ohh at lunch we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good and everyone wanted more. Finally, I had to wait @NUM1 hours on our way back home, just as long as the trip there. This is a time I had patience, a whole lot of it.
1152	19110	7	3	One day on earth an alien race came, descending from the sky in strange ships. They were called “@CAPS1”. They wanted these thing called the @ORGANIZATION2 balls which would summon a @ORGANIZATION2 & it would grant you a wish, a power they sought to claim for themselves. @NUM1 strong fighters, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 had to stop them from gathering the magical orbs. But they were to strong, overwhelming the defenders with their superior power. @ORGANIZATION1 was already dead then trained with king @CAPS3 in the afterlife to achieve a new level of strength, but the others were waiting for @ORGANIZATION1 to return and save them. Finally he came, bursting with new energy, & beat the crud out of them, sending the invaders fleeing. The earth was saved from the alien threat.
1153	19111	7	3	One day after school I was told I had a doctor’s apointment so I say when and my mom said @NUM1 and I had a dance after school that started at @NUM2 so I say @CAPS1 I have a dacen a @NUM2 and she said bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla! at lest that is what I herd @CAPS1 I mite of been rong. “@CAPS1 mom it’s my first dance” I said with anger, my voice rising in frustration. @CAPS1 she asked me to get in the car so time whent and we wher in the waiting room for an hour, the clock ticking slowly on the wall. I’ve all ready missed hafe the dance @CAPS1 I was queit them, sinking into my chair. We finnaly were in the officec and and gone home to get ready for the dance, rushing to change, and had a blast for the short time that remained.
1154	19112	7	3	Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you don’t have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didn’t want to wait so she didn’t look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldn’t really walk, her body bruised and bandaged. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma, a serious brain injury. So that’s what happens when you don’t have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window, looking suspicious. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1, whispering my location. They were on the way they were in the drive way, arriving quickly. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars, a surprising reward. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so that’s my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences in any situation.
1155	19113	7	3	One person I know was very patient one time I was associating with them. That one person was waiting for a call or e-mail that was promised to happen, an important message about his future. The call or e-mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state, known for its winning record. The person who was calling or e-mailing the person I was with was coach of that team, a respected and powerful figure. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1, where my brother performed very well. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team, scouting for new talent. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game, offering a handshake. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team, praising his skills. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address, hoping for the best. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum, setting a clear expectation. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home, his hope building with each passing hour. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him, which was disappointing. The second day still nothing, the silence becoming worrisome. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming, remaining calm and positive. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen, accepting the possibility. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team, thinking the chance had passed. Then the phone rings, breaking the silence. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team, a smile finally spreading across his face. That is one time my brother was patient and it paid off in the end.
1156	19114	7	3	A wise man once said patience is a virtue. Let's find out if that wise man is right. I’m going back @DATE1 years. I had just talked to my parents. I said, “@CAPS1, could you buy me this Lego for @CAPS2?” “@CAPS3,” @CAPS5 said, and then @CAPS5 asked me to move. I kindly moved out of her way and @CAPS5 ordered it online. It was @DATE1 when I asked her, “@CAPS1, do you know when my Lego is coming?” @CAPS5 said, “It should be here before or after @CAPS2.” I replied with an @CAPS7.K.. It was the week before @CAPS2, and I had checked the mail. “No package,” I thought to myself. So I checked the porch; there was nothing. A week after @CAPS2, the mailman came. On top, a package I could see. It turns out the wise man was right; patience is a virtue. This is the time I was patient. I also learned it's better to wait for some things, as the reward often comes to those who wait.
1157	19116	7	3	One day my mom and dad were looking up vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to @LOCATION1, a place just outside Traverse City. We decided to go for @NUM1 days; it was going to start next month. I was excited to go, but I still had enough patience to wait and wait till the people called us to tell us that we could go, expecting our reservation to @LOCATION1. When the day finally came, I was really excited. We got everything packed and ready to go; even the dogs were ready. After we put the dogs in the car, we started to go. We had to have the dogs go to my grandma's because they had no place else to go, so we dropped them off and started heading to @LOCATION1, plus it was a four-hour drive. When we were about an hour into the drive, my sister got really impatient and kept asking, “Are we there yet?” but I just sat there and looked out the window. Then we got to a pitstop, and we went and got our water and drinks. My mom and dad wanted coffee, so they tried to get some, but it didn’t work, so we had to stay there for like @NUM2 minutes, and they finally got some coffee. Me and Mironda were just sitting there the whole time. Then we were patient the whole ride to @LOCATION1, and our calmness made the journey much more pleasant.
1158	19117	7	3	Can you @CAPS1 a time in your life when you had to wait for something for a very long time? I had to wait for a long time. Do you think you knew what it is? It was @CAPS2 Eve. I was only five at the time. So I woke up on @CAPS2 Eve and couldn't wait till tomorrow. I told myself that all day. I went outside to try and waste some time, but that didn’t help because it was freezing outside. So I had to come right back in the house. I didn’t have anything to do. So I just kept waiting. Then, “@CAPS4,” my brother got up, and I just played with him the whole day till we had to go to sleep. Then it was time to go to bed, and I ran straight up to my bedroom and got right to bed. I woke up the next morning, and I was so happy that I didn’t have to wait anymore. I had to wait forever, and I was so happy that day. But now @CAPS5, I’m thirteen, and I really don’t care anymore, but I would still love to hear about your story someday, to share in the memory of childhood anticipation.
1159	19118	7	3	I was at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on. It was a huge line! It was like a big line of dominoes. I do not like waiting in big lines. Like most kids, I don’t whine and fuss about waiting. In my head, I’m thinking about when I would get to go on the ride. I don’t scream and shout, though; I just try to stand still and wait for my second to go on. Tick tock, tick tock. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later, it was finally my turn to go on the rollercoaster; I was so excited! I went on the ride; it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute long! That line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Oh well. That line was worth it in the end for that brief, thrilling experience.
1160	19119	7	3	On @DATE1, me and my two friends were all laughing outside, but then I had remembered that in @NUM1 minute I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside, and my friends were being so patient. They didn’t leave me, and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didn’t keep them waiting long. After I got done, we went back up to the park and swung on the swings. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home for the evening. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun one, filled with simple joys and the kindness of patient friends.
1161	19120	7	3	@CAPS1 lives in Ohio, where he attends @CAPS2 Middle School. One day after school, he was walking home when his friend, @CAPS3, asked him to wait in the school parking lot. @CAPS3 needed to call his mother to ask if @CAPS4 could stay at his house for the weekend. @CAPS4 agreed and waited patiently for an entire half hour while @CAPS3 talked and even argued with his mother over the phone. But after @CAPS3 finally finished the conversation, he thanked @CAPS4 sincerely for being so patient. They then left together and all spent a fun weekend at @CAPS8's house.
1162	19122	7	3	One time I was patient was when I really wanted an iPod Touch. My grandma, knowing how much I wanted one, was bidding on an iPod Touch for me on an online auction site. It took a long time for the auction to end, but we ultimately won the bid. After that, it also took a long time for the company to ship the item to us, but we finally got it. In the end, all the waiting paid off and I was thrilled with my new device.
1163	19123	7	3	If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1, that’s a different story. I’ll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course, I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldn’t be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to Kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldn’t get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn’t help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep sleep that was badly needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing. We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at different parts of this experience. Now you know that for me, if I’m very excited about something I can be very impatient, but if it’s something smaller, I can wait without much trouble.
1164	19124	7	3	I was patient when I was in school and my teacher left the classroom unattended. The kids started going crazy almost immediately; they were standing on the tables, throwing paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and crumpled paper balls all around the @ORGANIZATION1. The kids were screaming loudly, and I was just sitting quietly at my desk, watching the chaos unfold as the teacher walked back in and saw what was happening. I am just sitting there, amazed at how stupid they are acting for such a brief moment of freedom. Then I am watching them get in serious trouble and receive calls home to their parents. I am thinking it's a good thing I was not part of it because I might have gotten kicked off the cross country team. The kids are getting suspended from lunch for their behavior. I hope that this never happens to me again because I was just a witness, and sometimes a witness can get the other kids in even more trouble.
1165	19125	7	3	A time when I was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting. It all began when we woke up at @NUM1 in the morning, got dressed in our warm clothes, and left to go get in our deer blind. As soon as we got there and settled in, we heard a lot of gun shots echoing in the distance from shotguns, rifles, and even black powder guns. We waited silently and still all day long, from early morning until it was dark again, and then we packed up our gear and we left. Me and my dad didn’t see anything that whole day, not a single deer. That is a story about how I am patient, even when the outcome isn't what we hoped for.
1166	19126	7	3	"One day I was going hunting and I was patiently waiting for my dad to get his clothes on, which seemed to take a long time. When he finally did we headed out to the woods, walking quietly along the trail. After that we got in a blind, as we patiently waited for fiftyen minutes, watching the forest around us. Just then a deer came in, stepping lightly through the trees. It was a perfect doe, with a smooth coat and alert ears. Finally the deer gets in front of the blind about twenty or thirty yards and my dad quietly says ""wait for it to turn broadside."" So I waited until it turn and shoot the doe, my heart pounding in my chest. Finally we get out and find my arrow but never found the deer, only a few drops of blood on the leaves, and I had to have patient for next years hunt, hoping for a better outcome."
1167	19127	7	3	One time I wanted this awesome new video game console; it looked great with its sleek design and bright colors, so I asked my mom and she said we and it tommow so I waited and waited, checking the calendar each day. I was very patient but I started to get alittle irritated cause it was taking so long, watching other kids play with theirs. I was kind of getting impateint, I didnt complain though, knowing it wasn't easy for her, but I still want that console to this day im just have to be patient and maybe one day it will happen.
1168	19129	7	3	My brother was patient ones, my brother was patient by understanding a tolerant and not getting upset. He understand a toleran by sinting down waiting calmly in the hard plastic chair. He was waiting in the doctor to get steches after he fell off his bike, and he didn't cry or fidget. I was being patient by wainging with him, reading an old magazine. We always be patient when we have to wait for something, learning it makes things easier, another time I was being patient is when I always get my hair cut or hair line trimmed at the barbershop. I had to wait in a long ling to get my hair cut, listening to the buzz of clippers. That is some of the times I had to be patient, and it has taught me the value of waiting quietly.
1169	19130	7	3	One day I had a doctors appointment and I had to check- in at the desk, giving my name to the receptionist, and after I did that I had to sit and be patient till the doctors called me back to get my check up done, looking at the fish tank in the corner. I to wait till the real doctor came to see how I was feeling and to see if I was eating good to, answering all her questions politely. and then I had to go to the check out desk to see what was my next check up was, scheduling it for six months later, and then I had to get my pills refilled at the pharmacy window, and then I went home, feeling relieved it was all over.
1170	19131	7	3	One time I was pacient was when my mum said that she would buy me a Nintendo Switch game; I waited and waited and waited and wated for her, thinking about all the games I could play, but I knew I had to be pacient because she was going through hard times with her job and money was tight, so I tried my best to understand and not ask again.
1171	19132	7	3	These stories are about times when I was patient. This is one story, so one time my guardian was putting my winter clothes away this @DATE1 and I told her, like, these are my good clothes. I was like, they're not really winter clothes. She said she knew and she said she was just putting them up because she said I had too many shirts that were the same color. I was trying to talk back, but then I was like, oh, I see what you're saying, because I couldn't fit everything in my dresser. So I was patient and helped her put my clothes up. Being patient means can you do something somebody asks you, or can you do the right thing for people. Or can you help somebody when you think they need help with something. It is an important quality to have in life.
1172	19134	7	3	Once upon a time I was at the doctor and it was very crowded. Well, my mom went to go give the boy the information about me, and I was sitting down by this lady whose daughter was crying. When my mom came back, the doctors were calling names. I was trying to be patient, so I got up, went to the kids' play area, and started to play. A couple minutes later, the doctors finally called my name. We got there at @NUM1, but the doctors called me at @NUM2 pm. So they gave me a shot and we sat in the room for @NUM3 minutes. Then they gave me some modsers and told me to go get the parstarch and to get the problem, wanting me to go to @CAPS1/ pharmacy. And that’s the time I was being patient, waiting calmly through all the steps.
1173	19135	7	3	I was being patient when I was waiting for my own phone so I can text my friends and call them and do more things. I was also waiting to get my own snowmobile license so I can ride my own snowmobile on the trails. It was a long wait for both of these things, but I knew it would be worth it in the end. No matter what you are waiting for, you should always be patient. Good things come to those who wait calmly.
1174	19136	7	3	Playing hockey is important to me. I am a goaltender playing for Farmington Hills. Playing goal takes skill, having “thick skin,” and most importantly, being patient. Every game day @CAPS2 dad tells me, “be cool, calm, and collected,” the three @CAPS1’s, as I call it. I step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come @CAPS2 way. Once it does, I am in action. The period ends and I wait patiently again. The second period is here; I stand waiting for the drop of the puck, hoping we score. @CAPS3!!! @CAPS3!!! @NUM1 to @NUM2! @CAPS2 patientness helped, it’s @NUM1 to @NUM2! The third period comes. @CAPS3!! Big @CAPS4 by @ORGANIZATION1, that’s me! @CAPS3!! Goooaaalll!! @NUM5 to @NUM2. That’s it, the game is over! I waited patiently to get that win against the @LOCATION1. After the game, we all go and party at @CAPS5 @CAPS6’s house to celebrate a big win, and we all had a really great time doing it too. It showed me how patience pays off.
1175	19137	7	3	This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plane in an airport. We were on our way to @LOCATION1 and we had to take two planes to get there. When we got off the plane to the second airport, we went to see what time our second flight comes in. When we found out the time for the second flight, we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. My mom told me I had to be patient, but I am not good at being patient. To get things off my mind, we decided to eat. When I was done eating, I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it was annoying me, so I started to play my DS. Before I knew it, we only had one hour left; playing my DS had distracted me. I got impatient real fast, so that’s when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden, our plane arrives and I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learned to be patient, and it made the journey much better.
1176	19138	7	3	There have been times where I had to be patient. This one time I went to the dentist we got there and we sat down in the waiting room, which was quiet and smelled faintly of antiseptic. Let me tell you something I hate the dentist, the sound of the drill and the bright lights. So we probably sat there for an hour or two, just flipping through old magazines. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day, which was a relief to skip. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you don’t have to wait as long, usually just a few minutes in the exam room. That means you can get in and go. But sometimes you have to be patient in many other situations. Like when you get a job or an interview, you have to wait for a callback. One good thing patience can get you to good places, like achieving your goals. Being patient is a polite way to go, showing you respect other people's time. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way, it’s the better path. Not being patient is just disrespect, it shows a lack of consideration. Its like treating things like dirt, not valuing them. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and professional, something expected in good society. If I were you go patient it leads you to a good future, full of opportunities and respect from others.
1177	19139	7	3	Patience is very important; if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time, snapping at each other over minor delays. If there were no patience we wouldn't be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out of this meeting or this line. Some people have no patience and others have tons, which creates a noticeable difference in their daily interactions. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other; no patience could affect the littlest things, like we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money slowly at the register. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet; patience is one of the most important things on the planet, a cornerstone of civil society. Patience helps us make the right choice, allowing for careful thought. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away, you wait and make the better decision, considering all the consequences. Although many of us think we know about patience, I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting; it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like without complaint. It`s also going through life without saying why can`t I do what I want or you can`t because I can`t, but rather accepting the flow of events. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience; it would be a much more chaotic and hostile place for everyone.
1178	19140	7	3	Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone, is a vital virtue. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just doesn’t have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was held, feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. I sat next to all my friends and they all thought I would get first place, which added to the pressure. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just a little bit too much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didn’t know what he was doing, his hands were shaking. No one actually knew that he and I were friends; we kept it a secret. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak, which made my heart pound. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me in the lineup. I soon started to speak about Lady Liberty and the judges loved my speech! After we, my friend, Leo and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to each other and were talking a lot, relieved it was over. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, “No way why would I be friends with him?” then Sarah laughed. We both looked at each other, in a bad way, feeling hurt by the denial. After a few days we weren't talking to each other since Sarah was so suspicious and kept asking questions. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him, hoping things would calm down. But of course, Leo wasn’t patient at all; he couldn't stand the secrecy. He was eager to tell Sarah that me and him were friends but we couldn’t tell anyone because to them we were both different, but the truth is that we’re both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basketball, music and talking for hours. Haha! Soon Sarah found out the truth. Leo had gone and told Sarah that we were friends, unable to keep it in any longer. Turns out no one laughed at us; they were actually happy that Leo had no patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and Leo are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, while having patience is a good thing but sometimes people can’t have patience when they want to become friends, and that can sometimes work out for the best.
1179	19141	7	3	A time when I was patient was when me and my cousin's family went on vacation and my sister was sick with a bad fever. Me and my other sister sat in the car, which was parked outside a small clinic. For about two and a half hours we waited, playing games on our phones to pass the time. My sister was getting mad, complaining about the heat and the wait, but I just sat there patiently, watching people come and go. My mom and sick sister were in the doctors office for the longest time, it felt like an entire day. My sister ended up going to the doctors office three times that week for follow-ups. But I was very patient throughout the whole ordeal; I didn't complain once. When she wasn’t at the doctor, all she wanted to do was lay down in the hotel room so we barely got to do any fun stuff like swimming or sightseeing. By the end of the trip she was feeling better, her energy finally returning. So my mom took us to do something fun as a reward for our understanding, we went to a small amusement park. That was a time when I was patient, and it made a difficult situation much easier for everyone involved.
1180	19143	7	3	Being patient is waiting your turn in line and not letting someone cut in front of you; you should wait because cutting in line is rude and disrespectful, and you will have no friends if you act that way. Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend, appreciating your considerate nature. It is not being respectful when you don’t wait your turn, showing you only care about yourself. It is also rude to rush things when your mom and dad are speaking to another adult, you should not interrupt. It is rude to rush things when other people don’t want to do something with you right away, you must understand their timing. Or nagging to leave somewhere like a aunts or uncles house is another sign of impatience. It is very rude when you don’t wait, creating a negative impression. Be respectful and wait; it’s a better way to make friends and build good relationships. And if someone is not being respectful to you, tell them to be patient. And then walk away and say it is not okay to be rude and that they should wait and be patient. Grrr, it can be frustrating, but it is always the right thing to do.
1181	19144	7	3	I felt a thrill in my body, a surge of pure excitement. We were @NUM1 seconds from the opening of @ORGANIZATION1, and the energy of the crowd was palpable. I had to wait @NUM2 minutes to go on Space Mountain, the line snaking slowly through the dimly lit interior. I wish I could’ve cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait, practicing patience as we inched forward. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it, the exhilarating drops and sharp turns leaving me breathless and eager for more. At the end of the day I begged to go on one more ride, not wanting the magic to end. Again I had to wait @NUM3 minutes to go on, this time for a different attraction. The ride showed boring history of @CAPS1, with animatronic figures depicting scenes from the past. Then at the end it gave us a screen and we picked the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it, which finally made the long wait feel a little more worthwhile.
1182	19145	7	3	Have you ever babysat little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousin’s third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids while the adults talked. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food and pretending to cook. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what they’re doing and go play with the toy, too, drawn by the novelty. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball popper, giggling with delight as the machine shot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the remaining balls and scream in frustration. I yelled at them to stop, raising my voice over the commotion, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down, taking a few deep breaths myself. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball popper quietly after they had calmed down. I learned an important lesson from my cousin’s birthday party – babysitting requires a lot of patience, a lesson I carry with me to this day.
1183	19146	7	3	“@CAPS1!!” I had another math homework assignment due tomorrow and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth grade teacher would give us math homework that was really long and hard, filling the entire page. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard, the numbers and symbols blurring together. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm, that I could figure it out. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me, or so I thought. Every day I would come home, sit down at the table and take my time, slowly doing the work. @NUM1 problems a day was hard for a fourth grader, it felt like an endless mountain to climb. Whenever math started I would get out my homework and wait to check it, my stomach feeling tight. I never did terrible. @CAPS2 I was always proud of my work when I saw the good grade. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy, dreading the new challenge. A new lesson every day was also challenging, building on what we had just learned. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time, repeating the mantra in my head. One day my teacher gave us an easy lesson and I felt confident I could finish it at school, a rare feeling. I came to a hard problem every once in a while and I would stress out, my pencil hovering over the paper. But I remembered what my mom said, “be patient and stay calm,” @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem, step by step, until the solution became clear. Now to this day I remember to be patient when faced with a difficult task. I also remember that we will have to live with being patient all our lives, a vital skill for adulthood. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out, teaching me perseverance.
1184	19147	7	3	This one time my brother and I were coming back from @LOCATION1, the drive seeming as ordinary as any other. Everything was fine until the car broke down on the freeway, the engine sputtering to a stop on the shoulder. So we called our parents to come get us, explaining our situation. Well when they got there they forgot the cables needed to tow the car. So just as they were getting to us they left, turning around to go back home. So @NUM1 hours went by and here they come, pulling up behind us once more. I said did you remember to get everything, hoping we could finally leave. They shook their head yes, hooked up the car and away we went, the whole frustrating ordeal finally over and teaching us all a lesson about double-checking.
1185	19148	7	3	One time @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was sitting watching t.v. and having a fun time when his brother, or step brother @PERSON1 came in the room and said “@CAPS2 we have to go to my interview, or you are going to be grounded??” “@CAPS3 long is it,” @CAPS2 said, not looking away from the screen. “About an hour long,” replied @PERSON1. “But Itchy and Scratchy is going to be on, and it’s a one time only,” said @CAPS2, his voice pleading. “@CAPS6 that pointless kidshow, dude that was on the @CAPS7 and then they made into a real show.” “Where is it at,” @CAPS2 said, finally showing a flicker of interest. “It’s at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6 and the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 man @CAPS2 be there, we leave in an hour okay, so make a science experiment or something,” @PERSON1 said. @CAPS2 never liked the @CAPS9-@CAPS13 man, after the commercial he was in @DATE1, which I shall not say what happened, a memory that still angered him. @CAPS2 did what he does best, make a science experiment to plot revenge on the @CAPS9-@CAPS13 man or whoever he doesn’t like, gathering beakers and strange chemicals. So he waited for @NUM1 minutes for the experiment to get done, the liquid bubbling ominously. Then they left, it was a three hour drive, and his favorite show was on, he taped it so he could watch it later. He was being patient, then they got there, the building looming before them. He looked for the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man for @NUM2 minutes, his eyes scanning the crowd. Could @PERSON1 be lying to him, he wondered, his patience wearing thin. He was being so patient that he was getting tired, then fell asleep in a chair, and woke up and guess who it was standing over him. The @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man. “Remember me?” @CAPS2 said to the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 dude man. @PERSON1 watched and laughed from a distance, enjoying the scene. @CAPS2 threw a bonney ball into the @CAPS9-@CAPS10, @DATE2, no more @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man to bother him again. @CAPS2 was patient; he was patient for more than @NUM3 hours to get to watch Itchy and almost @DATE2 @DATE1 to get back at the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man, proving that his patience had ultimately paid off in the most satisfying way.
1186	19149	7	3	Usually I have very little patience (and yes I do know that patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospital room with my dad to spend time with my mom. The room was very boring, with its plain white walls and the quiet hum of medical equipment, but somehow I managed to go the whole day without being bored to tears. We sat for what felt like an eternity, just talking quietly and watching the clock. The highlight finally came when my dad finally let me watch some television in the room, which provided a welcome distraction from the otherwise monotonous afternoon. It was a long day, but I was proud of myself for handling it with such composure.
1187	19150	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when I was going school shopping. There were maybe over a hundred people in the store. It was like a cluster of pebbles in the sand; you could barely go down the aisles. It was as if a whole mall had been squeezed into one little store. Some people would leave because of how many people were in there, but then even more would come in to take their place. It was me, my mom, and my dad. We started to pick out our stuff and got in line behind maybe twenty people or more. My mom was ready to explode with frustration. So after thirty minutes, only a few people had gone through the line. My mom almost fell asleep standing up, and I was just standing there waiting patiently. But my arms hurt and my back ached. I was so ready to get out of that store. My dad was reading a magazine while he was waiting, an ESPN news issue to be exact. When there were only a few people in front of us, I was happy that we could finally buy the clothes. We got up to buy our clothes and then a cash register broke. The lady said it would take an hour or two to fix, so my mom started to complain loudly. We had sat in line for an hour and a half for this to happen. My dad was fine with it because he was so into that magazine. I could not believe that this happened; I was so disappointed and ready to go, and so was my mom, so we got my dad and left. My dad said, ""I am at the good part."" I didn't get the clothes that day, but we went the next week to get them, a lesson in patience learned."
1188	19151	7	3	"I was patient when we were on the bus after we had just arrived at school. The kids were loud and noisy in the morning, a chaotic start to the day. There were a lot of kids trying to get off the bus when someone jumped in front of me; then I fell back into my seat. There were about twenty to twenty-five kids getting off the bus, all pushing to get out. So I waited calmly for all the kids to pass me, then I got up and walked down the aisle to the door. The bus driver noticed my calm demeanor and said, ""Thanks for waiting."" Then I left, feeling good about having kept my patience during the morning rush."
1189	19152	7	3	"It was last fall, and my friends were talking about how cool Xbox was. They were saying how if you get Xbox Live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called Call of Duty Modern Warfare 5. I had searched it up online and it was voted to be a ranking of five stars. Now that's a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both would always say, ""We'll see."" After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why don't you wait till Christmas. And once I went to my dad's house he said Christmas is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it, can't I just get it now? My dad said no, so then after that I had waited two months thinking maybe he had changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my mom's house and asked her; she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I won't get it. And so Christmas came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an Xbox with my favorite game. I was so happy. And now I know if you have patience and you wait long enough, you’ll get what you want."
1190	19153	7	3	I am always patient. But do you know when and where I am really patient? It is when I am getting my hair cut. Every time I go to get my hair cut there are a lot of people in the barber shop. Some days people say they have to go somewhere for a party or for church and need their hair cut pronto. So I let them go ahead of me, and I have to wait and be patient. It makes me kind of happy to be patient because I am helping others, and I believe that if I ever need someone to be very patient with me, then I will want them to be patient in return. It feels good to contribute to a kinder, more considerate world in this small way.
1191	19154	7	3	"This is about a time I was patient. First, I was babysitting my cousins. Their names are @PERSON1 and @CAPS1, and they had to be kept out of the way because the adults were rearranging things upstairs, so we sat downstairs. Next, @PERSON1 and I watched a movie. I was called ""itches"" too, as they did not sit still; it took a lot of effort not to yell at them to sit down and watch the movie. It was at the beginning, and I wanted to play with @CAPS1, who was sitting quietly in her crib. Finally, they were almost done upstairs. The couch was moved and the chair, so it was more roomy upstairs. That was the time I was patient and managed the situation calmly."
1192	19155	7	3	I used patience when I went to Cedar Point @CAPS1. I used it when I was playing a video game. As I was packing, I grabbed my PSP and put it in my bag. I was bored halfway down there, so I grabbed my PSP and started playing, which made me lose track of time. As we traveled, my family did too, and we were pulling into the hotel; we were so close to the park, but as soon as I got there, I needed to maintain my patience. We got in line and were sitting there forever, so I played my PSP. The PSP helped me use patience. I used my PSP to help pass the time. It would have been hard to wait, but my PSP kept my mind occupied and helped me stay calm.
1193	19156	7	3	Patience is usually good or bad for me. Here are a few reasons why patience can be hard or stressful. If you are waiting to get a shot or life-threatening results, it can be very difficult. A way to avoid normal patience issues, like being bored, is to get some notes or school work to do or listen to an iPod. Patience is needed everywhere. For example, during car rides, birthday parties, vacation commercials, waiting for school to be over, restaurants, holidays, or whenever you say “I cannot wait,” and etcetera. To sum up a few ways about patience in my description, it is a common part of daily life that can be managed with simple distractions.
1194	19158	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother's name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist because my brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 were waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother, so I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully, I had my @CAPS3, so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later, I went to the bathroom. When I got out, a nurse told me to come with her; she led me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor hadn’t even started yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days, the doctor finally showed up. After an hour or so, the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the anesthesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy, which was actually funny. Finally, we left, and I was glad I didn’t lose my patience throughout the long day.
1195	19159	7	3	"When I was really patient was when I wanted my car and mother to cook me some lasagna. I did not have any of it since my person passed away on @DATE1. My mom had my @CAPS1 cook @CAPS2 for my first birthday. When she cooked some for my first birthday party, it was all gone. My @CAPS3 mother cooked @NUM1 pans of it. It was so good it was gone soon as she had put it out; when I say soon, I mean soon. I turned @NUM2 years old, and my mother did it big for my birthday party. My mom died from open heart surgery; she was @NUM3 years old. She had a lot of friends at her funeral, which was very nice. But getting back to what I was writing about, in @DATE2 I asked my @CAPS1 to cook me some. She said to me, ""Girl, it costs too much to make it."" I said, ""@CAPS1, do you want me to give you some money to cook the food for me?"" She said, ""No, save your little money that you have."" I said, ""But @CAPS1, it’s okay to take my money to buy my lasagna and cook it for me."" She said, ""Girl, what did I say?"" So I hurried up and put my money in my pocket, then I was keeping it moving. When we got in the truck, she said, ""Now @CAPS5, I am going to cook it for you when I get some more money and when I pay my bills."" In @DATE3, she finally cooked me some. The day she cooked it was @CAPS6 @NUM4, @DATE3. My aunties came over and got some, my brother and sister got some, and my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 got some. When they all wanted some, I stood there and watched them get it and waited for them to stop getting some. Later, when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 got some, I did not tell them when it was enough because I live in their house; my brother and sister live with them. The lasagna only lasted for @NUM5 days, and that was it. When she cooked it, I was happy. I brought it to school and ate it for my lunch, which made the long wait worthwhile."
1196	19160	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was at the end of the year in fourth grade and I’d just signed up for football. I had to wait from the beginning of summer. When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football even started. The summer passed by and it was time for the county fair. In the summer I show cows at the fair, so that made the time zip by really fast. Finally, it was almost time. I only had to wait eleven more days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came quickly. Then it was time to go. I liked football that year and I have played football ever since. It took patience to wait for football. Two months may not seem long, but for a ten year old it is hard to wait that long.
1197	19161	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when my brother was going to get me a present when it wasn't even my birthday yet. This is how the whole story began. It was a hot summer day and I had been doing my chores which include raking, mowing, and a lot more yard work. Mom and dad and my brother Travis had been talking a lot. When I was just sitting downstairs they would tell me to go do my chores, and then I could see them talking quietly. It bothered me a lot that I couldn’t hear what they were saying. I finally just carried on doing my chores and I just got done mowing, which took two hours, and I went inside and I started to watch tv. Suddenly I heard “click click tap bam,” then I heard a sudden yell of my brother Travis saying “hey get back here.” I went to our fourteen curly stairs and suddenly I was greeted by the licking and slobbering of a six month old puppy. I grabbed his collar laughing and saw his name was Max. He is now a three year old happy mutt and that was my brother’s present to me for getting all A's and doing a lot of work around the house. I love my dog, but that was the time I had to be patient.
1198	19162	7	3	One time I waited for a game but I couldn’t get it yet. So I asked my mom if she could buy me a new game. I asked her how much does it cost? Sixty dollars, I said. Then she said you have to wait for some days. A few days went by, and then I finally asked my mom again if she could buy it for me. She said yes. I said thank you. Then the next morning we went to the game store. I saw the game I wanted on the shelf. I told my mom that was the one, so we went to the counter and bought my game. I was happy that my patience had finally paid off.
1199	19163	7	3	The doctor appointment. On October fifth, me and my mom were getting ready to go to the doctors. Once we got there it was so crowded. I felt like we had been there for weeks, days even. There were a lot of kids crying and playing. I was so exhausted just from waiting for my turn to see the doctor. Twenty minutes later it was still not my turn. I was trying my hardest to be patient but it didn’t help at all with all the noise of the kids running around. I walked up to the register and that’s where I found out my appointment wasn't till three o’clock and it was only one. We had to wait a long time, but we managed to stay patient until my name was finally called.
1200	19164	7	3	One day my dad and I had a doctor’s appointment at two pm, so we went there on time. Then my dad and I sat there for a while. We thought it would only take a few more minutes. So we waited for fifteen minutes. Then my dad went and asked the receptionist how long it was going to take. They said about fifteen more minutes, so we waited for fifteen more minutes. The doctor still didn’t come out. We waited for another twenty minutes. My dad went to ask the doctor again. They said a few more minutes, so we waited for fifteen more minutes, and then the doctor finally called us. The doctor was over an hour late. When we went in the room the doctor said sorry because he was late. That’s how me and my dad were patient that day.
1201	19165	7	3	Being patient is a hard task to write about. One day I was with my mom in the city, looking for a pawn shop to sell an old necklace. We got stopped at nearly every red light on the way there, a journey that felt endlessly slow. Yet, no one complained in our car, even when we reached a certain red light that seemed to last forever. Right before the light turned green, a very old lady with a metal walker stepped in front of our car, moving at a painstakingly slow pace. We waited for several minutes for the old lady to pass safely to the other side. Surprisingly, still no one complained, and we simply watched her progress with a quiet understanding. It was a small moment, but it truly demonstrated the value of patience in our daily lives.
1202	19166	7	3	When you hear the word patience, what do you think of? I think about a person standing in a long line at a grocery store when there's a dozen people standing in front of you. In the fifth grade, my sister and I played the patient game one summer. It was about who could go the longest without any food, and all you could drink is water; the winner would get a whole box of Dunkin' Donuts to themselves. On the third day, I had about five bottles of water to fill my empty stomach, but my sister was still hanging in there, determined to win. By the fifth day, I had consumed about eight bottles of water and all day my stomach groaned loudly, along with my sister's. On the seventh day, with all the groaning and the growling, my sister was hanging on and so was I, though just barely, as I drank yet more water. Finally, on the eighth day, I snapped and had so much food that my whole pantry was gone. My sister Emily was cheering and she said, “Don’t worry, I’ll let you have one of my three chocolate doughnuts,” and she kept her word. In my opinion, that was a true display of patience and endurance.
1203	19167	7	3	One of the worst feelings in the world is discovering that your flight has been canceled. This has happened to many people, but only one family in my family has experienced it directly. My cousins were going to come to Florida for Christmas, and we were all so excited. Cara and I were texting and e-mailing each other daily about what we were going to do while they were in town. They had been planning this trip since last summer, but now their flight was canceled! We were so mad! My cousin's family had to be so patient because they did not know if they would be coming to see us or not. My grandma kept calling my uncle for updates every hour. My grandma finally had a good idea for them: to get on the next available flight. The only problem was that the next flight was at midnight and it would take them two hours to get here after landing. When they finally got here, I was at the airport waiting anxiously. When I saw my cousin, she said, “Everyone else was so patient but me!” I expected the exact opposite, but no! I thought that my cousin, Cara, would be the patient one, but I was wrong. In the end, it was a relief that they made it, and at least someone in their family was patient throughout the whole ordeal.
1204	19168	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my dad and I went to Leslie to go hunting for the day. We wake up very early in the morning, at four o'clock, and get there just before five. We stayed there in the cold, quiet woods until almost noon, and then we left. When we were there, my dad shot a doe in the early morning, around six o'clock. He shot another doe later, about ten in the morning, so we left with two big does in the back of my dad's truck. That was a long, cold morning of sitting and waiting silently, and it was a time that I was very patient.
1205	19169	7	3	One time I was patient when I went to the dentist for a check-up. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got there we got checked in and there was a lot of people there, so we had to wait a long time in the crowded waiting room. When I was waiting, I was sitting on the ground being really bored, flipping through old magazines. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know, to just sit tight. Finally, the dental hygienist called my name. So I went in, then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, taking X-rays and cleaning my teeth. Then when she was done, I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was still working with a different patient. But then he finally came, checked my teeth, and then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient, and I was proud of myself for handling the long wait so calmly.
1206	19170	7	3	"Patience someone was patient with me when I did not understand something. Someone was a teacher. The teacher did not complain about helping me, and along with the students in the room, they were all very considerate. When the teacher was helping me they sat and quietly did their work. The teacher understood that I did not understand how to do the work. It was during math class, and we were learning about positive and negative integers. My question was, ""How do you order them from least to greatest?"" She replied, ""I can show you, would you like me to?"" I said, ""Yes, please."" So for about ten minutes she helped me. In that time my whole class sat and did their work without a single complaint. That is one time when people were patient with me, and I truly appreciated their understanding."
1207	19171	7	3	Where do I begin? There wasn't ever a time when I was patient. I was always rushing people to do something and getting mad because they wouldn't do it fast enough or go fast enough for me. I would just get an attitude and show my frustration openly. That is why I can't be patient, and now you know the reason why. The end of the story is simply that I have never learned the teaching on the way people are coming from, and that is my own failing to acknowledge.
1208	19172	7	3	Having a meltdown! I have experienced this specific scene when I was in the fifth grade at Cross Creeds Christian School. It was the day of the school play, and we lived just around the corner. After fifteen minutes my patience was a little thin, almost gone at the fact that my mother wasn't there yet. Then twenty minutes later I had a temper tantrum and cried, and my patience was like a balloon that popped and lowered slowly as I grew angrier and angrier at the fact my mom wasn't there yet. This mistake will likely happen again to me, as I made the wrong choice to get mad over something ridiculously dumb. Learn from my words; I should not give up but keep trying to be better.
1209	19173	7	3	I’m going to tell you about a time when I showed patience. When my family and my mom’s boyfriend went on vacation to an amusement park. When we got there it was packed full of people. So we jumped in line for the first ride. We were so excited that the ride operator said fifteen minute wait. At first the line was moving very fast. Then all of a sudden it started moving like a sloth. It was so hot and humid that it was awful. We checked the time; it was forty minutes already. It felt like three hours. I was running out of patience. Then we got in the shade and it was cool and nice. Finally, we were the next to ride; we got on and it was a nice one. My sister and brother were so happy. My mom’s boyfriend timed the ride; it was only forty-five seconds long. We waited one hour for a forty-five second ride. That was one time that I showed patience under difficult circumstances.
1210	19174	7	3	Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, he has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; three girls, two boys. I am not going to lie, but I am very annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are also obnoxious. But my older brother is the most obnoxious of them all! He is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting at home one time, and my big brother was being very patient, when we would annoy him. He would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and messing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the arm. Yet, he would just sit there like nothing was wrong. He would usually beat my siblings and I if we would fight, but this time he didn’t care at all! I was seriously starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his cheek leaving his face red with four finger marks. He had been very patient ever since we started being annoying, but I think at this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. He got up, with his left hand wide open for a smack. Before I knew it, I was on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I’m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figured out that my brother was the one that got in trouble. He had shown so much patience by being tolerant during all those things, but in the end, he got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. At least I never got in trouble. That’s when being daddy’s little girl comes in handy, and the story serves as a lesson on the limits of patience.
1211	19175	7	3	When I am patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer, as they move quietly and cautiously through the forest. They don't always come; sometimes it could just be a fawn wandering by. Other times it can be does feeding in a clearing. But when you see a buck, that is everything. You first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a clean and ethical shot. When it does, you have to wait for the right moment to slowly bring up your gun without making a sound. Then you have to wait for the perfect shot, ensuring a clear line of sight. If you get it, you must be patient and wait for it to die, respecting the animal and the hunt. If you cannot find it right away, do not give up; you must patiently track it. That is when I was patient, and that patience is a fundamental part of the hunting experience.
1212	19176	7	3	"One time my volleyball team went to a fast-food restaurant. I was one of the last people off our bus, which means I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered ahead of me, listening to the chatter and the sounds of the kitchen. I talked to my friends as they waited too, helping to pass the time. Next I figured out what I was going to eat: a cheeseburger, a large fry, and a large drink. I watched the clock as my eyes got droopy from the long day. ""Number 57,"" the lady finally said. ""How may I take your order?"" she asked. I told her what I wanted, and she put it on her register, and I began to wait for my food. A couple minutes later, I got my order. Finally, after being patient, I got my food and rejoined my team. That was the time I was patient at the restaurant after the game."
1213	19177	7	3	People with patience are great teachers, and my mom is one of those great leaders. She has a great level of patience, which she demonstrates daily while managing a family and many responsibilities. When we ask for things over and over again, she doesn't get angry and outburst; she just says no or yes with a calm smile. Even when she comes home from a long and tiring day at work, she never complains. She just keeps a smile on her face and finishes the rest of the day's adventures. When she wakes up early in the morning to take us to school, she has a bright smile on her face and she never complains about being tired. My mom is a very patient woman and a great teacher and leader in our home. I appreciate everything she does for me, my brother, and my dad, showing us the true value of patience through her actions.
1214	19178	7	3	When I had to be patient was when I wanted a PSP. So there was a time when I wanted a PSP so badly that I asked my parents for it immediately. They said I had to wait until my birthday, which felt like a very long time away. But I really wanted it, thinking about all the games I could play. I decided to wait patiently, marking off the days on my calendar. I occupied myself with other activities while thinking about the future fun. After waiting for a long time, my birthday finally arrived, and I was thrilled to finally get a PSP as a gift, which made all the waiting worthwhile.
1215	19179	7	3	"I remember I had to use my sister's old phone, the Blackberry Pearl. It was really slow, it dropped calls constantly, and the keyboard was horrible. My birthday was coming up, and I really needed a new one, so I asked my mom if I was going to get one for my birthday. She said, ""Maybe. Be patient."" And I really wanted to know, so I kept asking her, and she said probably not. But I didn't give up hope. I was really patient until my birthday finally arrived. When I woke up, I saw presents on the kitchen table! My family watched me open them one by one. When I had one left, I opened it. It was a huge box! And I opened it to find another box inside, and then another, and another, and another. Finally, I got to the smallest one. I opened it and the side of the box said 'iPhone' on it!! I got an iPhone! I was so happy! ""That's what you get for being patient,"" my mom said with a warm smile, showing me that my patience had truly paid off in the best way."
1216	19180	7	3	One time I was patient; I was really patient. I was invited to a sleepover, and when I went to the sleepover, we went to the store to get pop. It was taking a long time because the store was crowded, and the line was very slow. I just waited quietly without complaining, even though I was eager to get back to my friend's house. I understood that sometimes things do not happen quickly, and I remained calm the entire time. That experience showed me what it truly means to be patient, and I felt good about handling the situation so well.
1217	19181	7	3	"What is patience? Being patient means to wait for something that may take a long time, but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is you're waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that money is tight and you don't stand by your mom's side begging for the toy every day, you're being patient. If you are doing that, then you're not being patient and your mom is going to say ""stop, you're being impatient."" Before you are rude and keep begging for what you want, think of other people, understand why it might take longer than you want, and be patient. It is a valuable quality that helps everyone get along better."
1218	19183	7	3	"I’m writing a story about patience. Patience can be like saying I’m waiting for you to get done with whatever you're doing. Something like the teacher has been waiting for the kids to be quiet. And they can’t, so even though she’s getting mad, she is still being patient with us instead of saying ""get out of my class,"" giving us chance after chance. Because she wants us to be good and stay in class, she controls her frustration and speaks to us calmly. This shows how patience can help manage difficult situations and teach others the right way to behave."
1219	19184	7	3	"I know a person that’s way more patient than me! That person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you’ll ever meet. I am not patient at all. First of all, when we're going somewhere, my sister would just sit there calmly, reading a book or listening to music. I would say, ""Can we leave now?"" and start pacing around the room. My sister never gets upset when we have to wait; she just finds a way to occupy her time peacefully. My sister is always patient, and I really admire that about her. That’s why I think she’s such a patient person."
1220	19185	7	3	One rainy afternoon on a Saturday, my little brother’s friend's mum called and needed me to babysit. She and my mom were going out soon and wouldn’t be back till nine p.m., so she needed me to come over. My mom drove me over there and dropped me off at seven p.m. She went through a brief entry on what to do if there is an emergency. When they left, me and the kids wrestled and watched television. We ran around, talked to each other (mainly they tackled me), and I lifted them upside down. Then at lights out, I put them in bed and covered them up, checking on them twice. After they brushed their teeth and went to bed, I walked down the stairs twice to read my book. I let out a real sigh and then I turned on the television, needing a lot of patience because my mom was late to get me back, but I managed to stay calm until she finally arrived.
1221	19186	7	3	There is a time in everyone's life when they have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my younger brother learn how to tie his shoes. I know this sounds like an easy task, but it really isn’t. Time after time again my brother attempted to tie his shoes but could never do it. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I would teach him. When we got started I thought this would be over in about five minutes, but no! He could not make the bunny ears correctly. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the laces as hard as he could and they would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps, but no, he was determined to tie his shoes himself. After about an hour of practicing, he finally got it! He didn't tie them perfectly, but it was good enough to keep them tied, and I said good job and started to walk to the kitchen. Then he asked about the double knot. So of course I walked over and told him just cross the two bunny ears and loop one around, but he didn't get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didn’t get it. We hit the half hour mark for the double knot lesson, and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When I came back, my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudly, having finally mastered the double knot on his own.
1222	19187	7	3	A time I was very patient was when I had to do a school project on birds, which included building a life-size scale model. On the model I had to glue new parts on every single day. But the glue took two full hours to dry completely. So I had to redo the gluing three separate times, which made it a ten-day project instead of just seven. I worked harder than anyone else in my class, but I kept accidentally breaking my wonderful creation. The delicate wings would snap off, and I patiently had to glue them back on, holding them in place until the adhesive set. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I originally wanted or expected. I used patience, carefulness, and a steady hand to finally succeed in creating the model I had envisioned.
1223	19188	7	3	A time when I was patient was during an afternoon I was with my mom and she decided, “let's make some cookies.” So we got all the ingredients ready and mixed the dough. They looked so good even though they weren't cooked yet. My mom said they had to go into the oven for twelve minutes! I did not want to wait that long for my cookies. As they started to take their shape of big, dark brown, round, and soft treats, my mouth watered and I wanted them now. The timer buzzed finally, my mom went over there, grabbed a hot pad and almost took them out of the oven! Right as I was about to get one, my mom snapped, “they need to cool down first.” She set the timer for another five minutes! I did not think I could wait that long. My mouth watered at the amazing smell. I was dying, I wanted them so bad! I thought the wonderful smell could kill me! Every minute seemed like an hour. Then the timer buzzed again and I sprinted over there, grabbed a plate and tossed two of the biggest cookies onto it, and while doing so I burned my hand a little. But I did not care; I took a big bite out of a cookie and my mouth was in heaven. My patience paid off in the end; it was so worth the wait for the delicious, warm cookies I got.
1224	19189	7	3	School is a place where you have to keep patient. By the end of the day you can run out of patience. You have to try hard to tolerate everything and maintain your patience. Most of the day it will be fun. Maybe if you just go along with it you will be cool and stay patient. But patience is something I use when it comes to waiting for lunch, and for the bathroom. See, every day I have to tolerate people who sign up for the bathroom right when I need to go; I have to wait until my name is called. I start to get very hungry before lunch, but I need to wait for that, too. Once I finally eat, I then have to be patient for my favorite class, which is gym. I have to be patient like this every single day of the week. I need to tolerate all of it weekly, and that is how I get through my school days.
1225	19190	7	3	One time I was patient was at a water park. Guess what day it was—it was the Fourth of July! When we pulled up to the ticket booth the man in the little booth said, “ticket please.” Then we pulled up to get a parking spot. When we got out we ran for the gates. But just then my sister forgot her towel. So I ran back to the truck and got it for her. Then we got into our bathing suits and went toward the water. The first ride I wanted to do was called the “Tornado!” Now I must tell you, this ride was very scary looking. But I said, “does any one want to go with me?” My dad and my mom's friend from work said yes! So we got in the line. The line was huge, with about fifty to sixty people in it. The wait was around two hours! But I did not complain one bit. Then we heard a blood-curdling scream from the ride. Then a man, a woman, and two young kids got spit out into the pool at the bottom. Finally, we got our tube and went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening where you could see the twenty-foot drop-off into the bright pink and yellow funnel. About ten minutes later we were at the port where you get on your tube. Then we went down. My mom's friend went down backwards. I said, “yes, you get to go down backwards. Hooray!” Then we started going down and then we just dropped; it felt like we freefell, going like forty miles per hour. It was scary. Then we got spit out into the pool. I found my mom and my two sisters. They laughed at my mom's friend because she was crying. Then she said she didn’t feel good. So she went to the truck and took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the afternoon. That is a time I was very patient while waiting for an exciting ride.
1226	19191	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the mall with my mama, and she had come to the mall to get some new clothes. That mall was incredibly crowded. Couldn’t nobody get in where I was standing, and I was getting so patient. The only thing I ever had to do was to understand the situation, and it was during this time that a white family was walking by and they all bumped into me. I was so patient waiting in that one spot, even though I was just ready to leave everybody behind when finally our time came to move forward. That was a time when I was truly patient. I was so proud of myself for how I held it all in. The feeling of accomplishment was immense.
1227	19192	7	3	"A momma bird was laying eggs. She layed three beautiful, blue, perfect eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""Just be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got aggravated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddling her wings, shopping for worms, cooking meals, and cleaning the nest, but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centuries, and millenniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the two oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""Why can't I fly yet?"" and momma said, ""Just be patient."""
1228	19193	7	3	I was very excited to get my first iPad. But, there was a very long line at the store. Repeatedly, my mom kept on telling me to be patient. So, I just stood there quietly. Then when we got closer to the front, I could not wait any longer. Finally, we got to the beginning of the line. When I got up there, my dad said, “What kind do you want?” I told him that I wanted the big one. Therefore, we got it and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day long. Then my mom said, “Stop listening to that music,” so I put it down for about two hours. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched TV and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient.
1229	19194	7	3	When I was patient, we were on our way to Six Flags with Sarah, her mom and dad and her brother and I. We were driving to go there. It took us three hours to get there. Sarah and I were very patient; we waited and waited to get there, and we were so excited. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a whole bunch of rollercoasters. We all waited in line about two hours for every ride; it was extra busy that day. Sarah and I wanted to ride the tallest rollercoaster. It was called the Goliath. The Goliath was three hundred feet tall; it was the tallest rollercoaster I had ever been on, and the same for all the other people that came too. To get on that ride it was a five hour wait; it was exhausting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front, it was worth the wait, and we had an amazing time.
1230	19195	7	3	“Click.” “Ok, cool grandma thanks.” I say. “You’re welcome,” Grandma says. “When will they be here?” I say. “I don’t know.” If you don’t know what I’m talking about, which you probably don’t, I’m talking about my shoes I just ordered online. They’re called Air Max. And boy was I going crazy over these things. I waited for five days and every day I would ask my mom, are they here yet, are they here yet, but every time I did, they weren’t there. I was starting to get mad. So finally I rode my bike around to get it off my mind and I see a UPS truck and I thought, oh yes, he’s probably going to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, and waited but still no shoes. So the next day I look up online where my shoes were, and it said Lansing, MI. I was flipping out; that meant they were coming. So again I was waiting, and waiting and my mom decided we go somewhere. So I went in the car to leave, and I thought I heard the truck, but nope. So we finally arrive back at my house and I looked to the left and yup! there they were sitting on my front porch in a rough brown box. I run over, pick it up and dash inside, tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man. I try them on and they are awesome. I thank my grandma and all my patience flew away. I felt so happy and relieved.
1231	19196	7	3	A time that I had to be patient was at cedar point in Sandusky, Ohio. My dad, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at cedar point. My dadís stayed at the motorhome while my dad, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but one or two of the roller coasters, my dad by the way, am not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my dad were going to back to the moterhome, but I wanted to go on just one more before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my dad that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park, the Raptor. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever, the queue snaking slowly through the switchbacks. I have ADHD, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still, I had to try very hard but eventraully I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride by the way was extremely amazing, a thrilling series of loops and drops that made the long wait completely worthwhile.
1232	19197	7	3	Jake. I was in love with the guy! I swear middle school is when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with Jake and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. October 15th is the girl‚Äôs choice dance and I was determined to go with Jake. So in social studies I wrote him a note. ‚ÄúJake, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From Sarah.‚Äù I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told Emily who told Ashley to tell Mark (who is Jake‚Äôs friend) to tell Brandon, (Jake‚Äôs better friend) to tell Jake I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so Jake found out before Ashley but, now he knows, and now it‚Äôs Friday and time for social studies. Patience is my essence I remind myself don‚Äôt be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasn‚Äôt because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed Jake my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today is October 15th and the dance is tonight. At my locker, which is four and a doorway down from Jake‚Äôs I have a note taped to it. It reads ‚ÄúGive me your phone number and I‚Äôll call you for the dance.‚Äù. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I gave him my number and wait by the phone. I think he‚Äôs testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and tell me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didn‚Äôt ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.‚Äô When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word. Yes! My heart soared with relief and excitement.
1233	19198	7	3	Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you to be patient? Recently I've been patient. My family got a new microwave and its too big for our counter so we had to put it above our stove. Well there wasnít enough space above the stove so my parents decided to remadle the whole kitchen. My step mom took everything out of the kichen and put it all over dinning room, and now we can barely walk in the dinning room .Lately my family has been eating in our living room. (yuck) I really donít like eating in our living room it just seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So thatís a good thing. Idonít know how much longer I can keep up with this. But I've got to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off, as our kitchen is finally functional and tidy again. Now you know to always be patient.
1234	19199	7	3	It was a nice warm sunny Saturday day!!! We decided we could go pick up every one from my dads house and go to the genesee county farm. We got to my dads house and pick up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad. We start heading to the genesee county farm. We started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain that would be a waist of money. We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding, water seeping under the large doors. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong, making the best of our washed-out day.
1235	19200	7	3	One day my grandfather and I went fishing my grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, ìthat will take far ever just catch some fish.î I told him that was going to catch a turtle and that was final. When something pulling at my fishing rod I taint to pull it in and what pulled my line was a small white bass. The next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass. I was getting angry because there were no turtles bitting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a 12 inch white bass it was the biggest fish I ever caught before but it werenít a turtle. After I caught that fish I said itís time for a break time. I was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was jacking around and catching fish. At the time I was finshing my sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling.  I had to grab my fishing rod and reel in my fish but it werenít a fish it was a baby turtle, its little legs paddling in the air. My patience had finally been rewarded, just as my grandfather had taught me.
1236	19201	7	3	"In @CAPS1 middle school, in @PERSON2's dirty and muddy science classroom, a boy named @CAPS2 and another named @CAPS3 were cleaning the mess @CAPS7 made earlier, from their mudball fight. For years, @PERSON2 was trying to @CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to figure out what could calm them down. @CAPS7 DO have @CAPS4 though… @CAPS5 @PERSON2. Often she wondered what went though their minds when @CAPS7 got angry. When teaching them science, @CAPS7 never understood the basic concepts. When @CAPS7 did wrong things, @CAPS7 didn't know it was wrong, like shouting during a lesson. @CAPS7 progressed @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 in her class, understanding little. But it was as the principal said, ""@CAPS6 patient, @PERSON1; @CAPS7 will learn eventually."" @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 as the months passed, @PERSON1 believed her husband more and more. By being patient with them and not getting angry at them when @CAPS7 did something wrong, their grades started picking up soon, and by the end of the year, @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 were @CAPS11- plus students. @CAPS7 had passed @PERSON1's class with marks she never thought possible. On the last day of school, @PERSON1 went to her husbands office. She @CAPS12 him that his advice worked and that he was a great principal. All @PERSON3 replied was "" @CAPS12 you so!"" with a knowing smile."
1237	19202	7	3	I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dadís house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late to turn back. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I @MONTH1 add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around the store aisles doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on tightly. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did, coloring a few pages. I was only @NUM1! I donít really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because itís implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun? I still don't think so.
1238	19203	7	3	Being patient is very difaclut. I was a the store with my mom, and of course @CAPS1 was taching forever. ìcome on mom lets go do we really need this stuffî I whined, but @CAPS1 just continued shoping, looking at every item. Grrr I was so angry. I almost thought about throughing a fit right there in the aisle. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we were in line. As we got into the car my mom looked at me and said give me your phone. ì@CAPS2 whyî? I asked, completely surprised. The way you ackted in that store was horibal, she explained. Now I no I will alway be patient with my mom, no matter how long she takes.
1239	19204	7	3	Every year I go to my dads. He lives in @LOCATION1 so we stop ta the border. The border takes @CAPS1! So my family has to be patient, with them. On our way @LOCATION1 one time the border was packed, with cars lined up for what seemed like miles. Our family had to be patient, or there were going to be some argueing. With four kids it is bound to happen. After an hour every ones patients were running low, so my dad kept repeating keep patient, keep patient over and over like a mantra. We finnaly past the boarder and everyone cheerd with relief. So keeping patience is not the easyiest thing to do, especially in a hot car. We all need to learn just a little more about how to keep it when things get tough.
1240	19205	7	3	Are you a patient person? Well Iím not! Well, I can be patient I just wonít like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since theyíre kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. itís hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1, constantly pulling them from mischief. They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs, knocking things over. My brother and I had to be patient with them, guiding them gently. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didnít want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is, and I learned a valuable lesson.
1241	19206	7	3	The bell had finally rung, and it was time for lunch. It felt like math class would never end, the minutes dragging on as I watched the clock. I rushed to the cafeteria without even stopping at my locker, my stomach growling. When I got there, the line for lunch was immense, a winding queue that seemed to stretch for a mile down the hallway. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line and stood there, shifting my weight from one foot to the other as I waited. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I just waited. Several long minutes later, I was finally near the front of the line, close enough to smell the food. All of a sudden, seven girls just cut in front of the line because their friend let them join her. Even though that made me angry, I didn’t complain and stayed patient, knowing it wouldn’t help to make a scene. I soon got my lunch and found a seat. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient, remaining understanding and not complaining despite the frustration.
1242	19207	7	3	During the summer between fourth and fifth grade, my family and I went to an amusement park! Many of the rides had lines, but none of them had a line as long and winding as the roller coaster. The line was huge, snaking back and forth behind the metal railings. As my brothers, their best friend, and I approached the roller coaster, we thought we would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but we didn’t see the point as the line barely moved. When we got about halfway, one of the employees shouted, “Ten more minutes!” and we became more excited, our anticipation growing. Eventually, we made it to the front of the line! All we had to do was wait for the current trial run to be over! But then, the speaker came on: “All rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and we must pause operations because of safety issues.” We had briefly considered leaving, but had a feeling we shouldn’t abandon our spot. We talked with some other kids we had met in line to pass the time. We played games like rock, paper, scissors while we waited under the pavilion above the line, sheltered from the rain. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thank you from my dad for keeping us in line.
1243	19208	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was getting my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. We were walking past a last chance rescue booth and we went to see the puppies they had on display. My mom didn’t want another dog, but when she saw our future dog, Baxter, she gave in. He has grey fur with some black spots and a black line running down his forehead. At the center of the adoption event, he was a grown short hair blue heeler mix. We asked the lady if we could get him, but she said they were going to a pet store and we could complete the adoption there. We got in the car and drove to the designated store. Once there, we signed the forms and played with him inside the store. But we also walked down town with him on the leash and we got some ice cream before we finally went home, a happy and patient family with a new member.
1244	19209	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vacation to the beach. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red and watery. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to a doctor's office, but there wasn’t one around, so we found an urgent care facility instead. We went there and waited in the waiting room for what felt like a long time. Finally the nurse called out my name. So we went into the examination room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok, I’ll be right back. Then my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting in the small room. I was getting really impatient, fidgeting in my chair. Then finally she came back and told us that she had been working on another patient and told us once again she would be right back and that the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting, listening to the quiet hum of the clinic. Finally the doctor came in and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes, he did come right back with the paperwork. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of three hours of my vacation, but I managed to stay calm. That’s a time where I was patient.
1245	19210	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. It was at my cousin's house. It was very boring though. I was also sad and lonely at the time, so I am going to tell you about it. It was not long ago, I was at my cousin's house for a family gathering. Everyone except me was riding around on the property. There were not enough four-wheelers, so I was the only one left out without a vehicle. I felt so lonely sitting on the porch steps. I couldn’t believe how bored I was. All I could do was watch with envy as the others raced past. Everyone was having fun except for me. They were screaming with joy and laughing until they would cry because they were having so much fun. Then my dad noticed me sitting in a corner by myself. I smiled to try to look like I was having fun, and then he asked me if I wanted to go next. I said yes! So I hopped on the four-wheeler as soon as it was free, taking off like there was no tomorrow. I knew the wait was only a little while, and I said a silent thank you to my dad. I could not imagine how much fun this was going to be. I felt the breeze hit my face, my shirt flapping on my back; it was amazing. “I wish this day would never end,” I said, screaming with joy. I had a lot of fun that day. I never had that much fun in my life. A lot can happen when you are patient. Even though I was bored at the beginning, it was worth it in the end; that was a time I was patient.
1246	19211	7	3	"Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! @PERSON3 is hurt!"" I yelled, my voice filled with panic. ""@CAPS1? How did it happen?"" ""@CAPS2 is bleeding by the highway at the corner, and the fence is broken; @PERSON1 is with him,"" I explained. ""@CAPS3 replied, 'papa! Call @PERSON4 @CAPS4!'"" Nana yelled, taking charge of the situation. ""@CAPS5, get @PERSON1 and come inside right now!"" nana exclaimed. ""@LOCATION1, @CAPS6, we need @CAPS7 leo!"" @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, nana, and popous hurried to carry @PERSON3 (who is a horse) to the car port to take a closer look at him. Hours later, after trying desperately to keep him warm, @PERSON4 finally arrived. They managed to get @PERSON3 onto a tall table and started to bandage him up. They tried to get him to stand up, but @CAPS11 wouldn't, or couldn't, get to his feet. @PERSON1 and I were waiting anxiously in the house, trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live through this. @PERSON1 then decided that she was going to help out with her horse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it over to @CAPS8, his mother. @PERSON1 was standing behind @CAPS8 when they set the table down, and suddenly, @CAPS8 kicked @PERSON1, sending her stumbling back toward a tree. The next day, @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard so the horses could have some shade to cool down. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could possibly do for @PERSON3. They got their answer @NUM1 minutes later; they said that they would stich him up and see @CAPS1 else they could manage to do. They stitched him up for three long hours. They instructed us to watch him closely and see if any wounds would reopen or come out of their stitches. They also said they were going to check up on him the folowing @DATE2. That @DATE2 finally came, and they took him to the statules and took care of him for a while. @CAPS11 eventuly got belter and recovered. That's how I showed patince in the @DATE1, through a long and worrying ordeal."
1247	19212	7	3	"There have been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one particular story will intrest you the most. Finaly we got to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we got there my first thought was ìparadiseî; little did I know that there were the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides; they were for every thing, from getting a locker to buying food. In two days of fun, it was already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. My mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we could go to the park, so I did. When we got to the park, the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave ìparadiseî behind. We left around @NUM2, thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 hours, but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly outside. I asked my mum when we were going to get home and she said, ""just be patient."" So I just went along with it and sucked it up, trying to stay calm. "" @CAPS3, we are home!"" I say, running inside the moment we arrived. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock; it was @NUM5, a full @NUM6 longer then we had originally thought. But I had to go to bed right then (which meant no video games). That is a time I truly displayed patcience during a long and tedious journey home."
1248	19213	7	3	I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry or frustrated. For example, if you were in a popular amusement park, you would have a lot of people wait in line to get on a ride; if you're patient you would wait calmly, but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out, missing the fun. People might respect you more when you are patient and calm. Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait, which often leads to frustration. Though waiting for things can be difficult, losing your temper is not nice for anyone involved. In conclusion, I believe that being patient is a very important and valuable trait to have in life, helping you through many challenging situations.
1249	19214	7	3	I have been patiencent a lot of times but right now me and my friends are saving up to meet @PERSON1! Thats alot of patience just for one ticket, as it costs @MONEY1! So just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! Itís hard being patience, it exspecially is when your are going to meet a celebirtly that you have the hugest crush on! I have been patiencent a lot during this entire process of saving up money. No matter how hard its going to be, I know I can do it with patience. My friends and I have been patiencent and still are. I meant, could you stay patiencent if you were goning to meet your favorite celebirty that you love? Well itís not that easy; first off it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus you have to count how much money you have saved. And when people borrow your money, that really sets you back on your goal. But like I said, no matter what we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tax to meet him and we are going to be patiencent the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and you get to see and learn how to become patiencent. Overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life, making it a crucial skill.
1250	19215	7	3	"I had a friend, well she is @CAPS4 best friend and we have known each other since @NUM1 grade. Then in @NUM2 grade she said she has to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved away and she would call me all the time, like two times a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours each time. I will always remember her. Until this one day came: she called and @NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over at our house. One of @CAPS4 mom's friends called me over and I told @CAPS1 (who is @CAPS4 best friend) to hold on because someone is calling me; she said okay so I left the phone on @CAPS4 bed while she was still on the line. I went to the living room and @CAPS4 mom's friend said, ""can you get me a glass of water?"" and @CAPS4 mom's five other friends said the some thing. I went and got them all water. After that, @CAPS4 mom said, ""go take out the trash,"" so I went and put on @CAPS4 scarf and took the trash out; it took like @NUM4 mins and I had her waiting all that time. When I took out the trash, @CAPS4 best friend was outside and she said, ""@CAPS3 can you stay outside with me and play for a little bit?"" and I forgot all about @CAPS4 friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @NUM5 min. then I said, ""I got to go back inside."" I went in and sat on the sofa and @CAPS4 moms friends that were over at our house were talking and I sat with them talking, laughing, playing, and watching t.v. After two hours and a half, while I am watching t.v., I tell myself, ""what am I forgetting?"" I knew I forgot something, but I didnít know what. So I get up and I walk around the whole house telling myself what did I forget. When I get to the room I was talking to @CAPS1 in, I seen the phone on the bed and I picked it up and said, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1!"" I forgot about her. I said hello just to see if she was still there, even if I had a feeling she wasn't, which she was. She told me, ""you kept me waiting for the longest time ever."" I told her, ""wow, you're so patient; I would never wait that long."" She said, ""come on, youíre @CAPS4 best friend. I would wait forever for you."" So we continued talking, and I was amazed by her incredible patience."
1251	19216	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there, I don’t really like to wait. I can be patient, however! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at seven and it is only four, you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow, which tests your ability to stay calm. Patience is a quality that is important for getting along with others and managing frustration. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient. You should too, as it makes life much smoother!
1252	19217	7	3	Last year, in early November it was my birthday, so I told my parents what I wanted for my birthday and out of everything I said “Mom I want a PlayStation” (PlayStation 5 station console). So the next day we go out at three in the morning to get my console and we were at Best Buy. So we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over a hundred people in the store. So we walk over to the game aisle and there were two left and their was five people in the section so we grabbed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at almost eight in the morning. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my PlayStation, and I learned that wherever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect.
1253	19219	7	3	One day my dad and I decided we would go fishing. We were supposed to leave early, but he kept delaying. He kept saying five more minutes, so I just sat there in the car, trying not to get annoyed. I waited and waited, looking out the window. Finally I got out to find him a sleep with a note on his chest saying ten more min. I realized then that patience sometimes means accepting things you cannot change, even when you are excited to go.
1254	19220	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at home watching my baby brother for for my mama so she can go grocery shopping and my brother was crying cuz he was sleepy and hungry so I put him to bed and I had to be patient cuz he was a baby and my mama was gone for a long time and she had to do other stuff like shop for clothes, groceries, shoes, when my brother woke up he was crying and I couldn’t stop him from crying no matter what I tried and when my mama pulled up he stop crying and he started laugh That’s a time when I was patient and learned how important it is to stay calm!
1255	19221	7	3	When I went to see a popular concert. I was in the audience and The audience Was very loud and excited. The situation showed my patience were not the best people around me pushing so I waited in front of everyone and I got from the twelfth row seat out on the floor. It was a test of my ability to stay calm in a crowd, but it was worth it in the end.
1256	19222	7	3	I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: teaching me how to swim. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught me how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting me into the deep water of the pool. He wanted me to go to the deep end of the pool but I was too afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get me into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told me to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get me into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with me. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on me. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friend's hard work and patience paid off for both me, and him.
1257	19223	7	3	"It was the month of March and I, a hopeful student, had applied for a university. I had applied in January and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to me from the admissions office. From the beginning of the month I had checked the mail box every day. Every day as I ran down the driveway I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because the middle of the month had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climax of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. Friday was the first day of spring break and I was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""Today is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail box and bolted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me. Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to me. She looks at me and says ""Today is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in that month of March I had had my fair share of patience."
1258	19224	7	3	A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called X-Men Origins: Wolverine and my mom said I had to wait until Christmas came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a little short on cash at that time so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few weeks had passed I forgot all about the game then on Christmas day my sister and I got down stairs so fast then when we were opening gifts I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it and I opened it and it was it X-Men Origins: Wolverine and two other games that I wanted. After that I go up to my room grab my console and headphones pop in X-Men Origins and played it all day long. The long wait made finally getting the game feel even more special and rewarding.
1259	19225	7	3	One day, I had to be patient. Why? Cause I had ask my mother can I go skate but she told me to be patient so we wait and till she said yea. After waiting we was mad cause my mother had to go get the money for my sister. So next always be patient but if you do not be patient you will not get your way. Like one day my sister Haven and I want to go to the movie with our friends so we had to be patient for a whole hour why cause we had to wait and till mom got off of work for she can give Haven some money and me some money. So that is how you be patient. It is not always easy, but it is often necessary to get what you want in the end.
1260	19226	7	3	When my friend and I went to the amusement park, it was very busy. We didn't have to wait a long time for the first ride, but for my favorite ride we had to wait a long time to get on. My friend was very patient and I was not. I kept complaining on how long it took. Eventually we got on the ride and had a blast. It was horrible waiting, but it was worth it because the ride was the best one there. It's the best ride in the whole wide world. That day taught me that a little patience can lead to a great reward.
1261	19227	7	3	To write about a time I was patient is hard for me to do so since I am not a patient person, but I am going to try. Three days before the trip to Cedar Point felt like an eternity; I could not wait for it to be here. I did try to make the time rush by, thinking about the roller coasters and the fun, but it didn’t work. I had been off of school now for a few weeks and I had done everything I wanted to do, from playing games to riding my bike around the neighborhood. When me, my mom, my sister, and my friends go we always have a lot of fun together, of course. Every night since I have known we are going to Cedar Point I would sit on my bed and think. One day when many kids would ask and complain to their mom saying, “I can’t wait, can’t it come any sooner?” but me, never, not once. I know that no one could make time go by faster, no matter how much you wish for it. So I waited, I did my chores, I packed my bag, and I watched tv. Trust me, it was very long, very boring, and the urge to complain was itching at me, but I didn’t. I took a deep breath every time this restless feeling would happen to me. And I would say to myself, it is only a little wait compared to other things in life. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to Cedar Point when some kids never get to go. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and what I did while waiting for Cedar Point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life. This is also a time in my life when I was patient, and I felt proud of myself for managing it.
1262	19228	7	3	Being patient is something I am working on. Well, I have a baby cousin coming from another state and she was adopted from California, so I have never seen her before. I have only seen her in pictures and photos that my aunt sends. So I have heard her little voice on my phone before; she sounds so cute and I’m missing my aunt and uncle too, I haven’t seen them in several years. Our whole family is still being patient, waiting for them to come tomorrow or today. It’s a surprise visit they planned, and I am being patient, trying to keep myself busy so the time will pass. I am excited to finally meet my new cousin and give everyone a big hug after waiting for so long, which is a good lesson in patience for me.
1263	19229	7	3	It was a cool, crisp morning in late November. The sun was just coming up as I got into my box blind, my breath making little clouds in the air. It had snowed the previous night but it was only a light dusting. Then again, I was in the upper peninsula of Michigan, so that was normal. I was hunting for a monster ten point buck with my brand new rifle, a gun that could kill a deer from hundreds of yards away. I have been sitting for an hour but it felt like a whole day. I’ve only seen a squirrel and he was fun to watch and all, but not the rush you get when you see a deer. Then I heard it, “Grunt, grunt!” I was looking in the direction the sound was coming from. “Grunt, grunt!” Gun up, my adrenaline kicking in. “Grunt, grunt!” I see movement, put my scope on it and I see it. It’s a—it’s a grouse? I lowered the gun, calmed down, and watched it eat some corn I had scattered earlier. It was now time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwich, an apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple, eating slowly while looking around, when I saw a brown figure move through the trees. I grabbed my gun with my apple still in my mouth. So picture a guy with all his camouflage on, an apple in his mouth, and looking through a scope. As I looked, I realized it was him, the big buck. Massive horns, a big body, and he was probably five, maybe six years old. I put my crosshairs just behind the shoulder and I clicked the safety off. I slowly pulled the trigger, my mind a blur, and “Boom!” A perfect shot. Later that afternoon, I found him and he was big, a true trophy. I got him mounted and that’s where he is now, on my wall, a reminder of the patience that finally paid off.
1264	19230	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait in line for two hours just to ride the biggest roller coaster. Then I finally got on and it took off, accelerating to seventy miles per hour. I was stuck to my seat for five minutes then it went down a huge hill at seventy miles per hour. I got off and rode it again, the g-force pushing me back into my seat and I was faced forward the whole time. The drop is incredibly steep and takes your breath away. The ride was about three minutes long and it seated twenty-four people. I went on the Power Tower ride after that and it was intense. My favorite part was the replay of the ride photo; it was fun to see everyone's faces. I came home as it was getting dark in the evening. I woke up the next day and ate breakfast, thinking about the whole time and how I waited with patience, a quality I saw in everyone else in those long lines that day.
1265	19231	7	3	The time when I was patient I was about seven years old because I was in second grade; I'm older now but back to what I was saying. I was saying that I was seven in the second grade and I was standing in the lunch line and these kids just kept on cutting me in line just for some lunch. I just sat there, being patient and myself, even though it was frustrating to see them go ahead. But I just stood there quietly, waiting my turn without saying a word. So when we did finally get to the front of the line, I was okay. It was okay because I still got to eat my lunch, and I learned that being patient sometimes means you still get what you need in the end.
1266	19232	7	3	One day when I had to be patient was when I was waiting for the game @CAPS1 @NUM1 to be released. I was waiting outside the GameStop, full of anticipation. One day before @CAPS1 @NUM1 was scheduled to come out, I kept looking at the promotional signs for the game and I said to myself, “@CAPS2 must be a really good game.” So instead of just waiting at GameStop all day, I decided to go home. There, I played a game of @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my Xbox @NUM4 to pass the time. I played until I got tired, and then more tired, and eventually I fell fast asleep right there in my Pep game chair. I slept there until the next morning. My older brother woke me up and said, “Let’s go to GameStop to get @CAPS1.” So we went to the store and waited in a very long line for what felt like an hour and thirty minutes until it was finally our turn to buy the game. It cost about @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 with me and my brother had @MONEY1, but he didn’t want to put any of his money in for the game. I said to him, “I’ll pay my @MONEY3 and you will pay your @MONEY1.” So we bought the game together and then we played it for a long time, continuing until we finally beat it.
1267	19233	7	3	Here is a way that I had to be patient, and we all know that everyone has to be patient with others. It was my birthday, a day I had been looking forward to. I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, or my cake, or the ice cream; no, I was thinking only of getting money from my presents. I opened the first present, but there was no money inside. I moved on to the second present, and yes, this time there was some money. I continued opening presents one by one, hoping for more, until I got to the very last present. It was a card, and it just had to have money in it. I couldn't wait until I could finally buy something with all the cash I had collected. How does being patient fit into this? Well, after my birthday, I had to wait, and wait, and wait some more to actually get the thing I wanted. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe it, wanting something so much and having to wait that long? Well, anyways, my patience ultimately payed off. When I finally got the item, I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, especially if it's for a long time, but it’s also a good thing to do because it pays off in the end.
1268	19234	7	3	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every muscle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes anxiously scanning the crowds. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And then I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head finally stopped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1, I am gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip I took with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting in the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited! You see, I had been gone for two whole weeks and I was feeling really homesick. It took everything I had to not just go looking for him all over the terminal, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off; I had to be very patient and stay in our meeting spot. In the end, it was worth it because it would have been much harder for him to find me if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening to my story.
1269	19236	7	3	This is a story about a time when I was patient. It was the @NUM1 of @DATE1 and we were on a plane about to go on a cruise. When we finally got to the ship I was so excited, thinking about how much fun I was gonna have, what my room would look like, and going to all these cool new places. So we got on the dock and there was a long line, but I was patient and waited to get on the ship. Then, there was another line to check our passports, so I was patient and waited once more. After that, there was another line; it was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again, just standing there quietly for a little bit until it was done. But wait, you would never guess, there was yet another line after that. So, like for all the other lines, I stood there on my iPod listening to music to pass the time. Then my dad said, “Ready?” I said, “Ready for what, another line?” He said, “No, to look at your room and relax.” I was so excited. Finally we were done with the lines, with no more waiting for a while. So I opened my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room; it was amazing. The bathroom was a little small, but it was great. I was so happy to finally be done with all the lines. That is a time when I was patient.
1270	19237	7	3	One time I was going to see my friend who lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young children playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 skateboarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird person, not to be mean or anything. I finally got to her house and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward, saying, “Oh, hi @CAPS2!” she exclaimed and smiled kindly. Then she told me, “I have to finish my homework and eat dinner first.” I nodded in understanding. So I went to wait for her at the nearby park. I sat on a swing and gently swung myself back and forth, watching the sky change colors. A full hour went by. I patiently sat there the entire time, wondering if she was still coming out. I decided that maybe I should just go home since it was getting dark. Just as I got up from the swing, I saw she was finally outside. I went over and told her I had to go home because it was late, but that I could come back tomorrow. That was a time I was patient.
1271	19238	7	3	One afternoon, I was very patient when our flight got delayed. We were going to Florida that afternoon when all of a sudden the delayed sign came up on the monitor. I was kind of sad but I said I had to be patient! Our flight was postponed for several hours. So when we were waiting we did a lot of things! First we went to eat in the food court! We decided to go to Chili's. we also had to wait for our food! Got some good hatch green chile burgers & they were very good! Then we went to the airport gift shop! At the airport gift shop I got three key chains for my friends! Then I got myself two magazines & a reading book! I also get some Cinnabon cinnamon rolls! They were very good! Next we just took a little walk around the terminal. Then we went and sat down & relaxed for couple hours. Then I fell asleep! when woke up we were just about ready to board! I was very excited to finally get to Florida & enjoy all of the sunny weather! I learned that being patient really does matter! That was the time I was really patient.
1272	19239	7	3	Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three steps to being patient are being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with John, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still cold. There was a little heater in the shed thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the deer to come closer. John loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran off. Perfect shot! We got out of the shed and searched for a blood trail. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was worth it. The right way to be patient is shutting your mouth, not whining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient. Being patient is a valuable lesson.
1273	19240	7	3	Being patient is a very hard thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a Saturday and my mom woke me up at six she said we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didn't know that I was going to have to be patient the whole day. First on our way to the farmers market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about forty-five mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the farmers market we had to stand in line for about twenty mins. I told my mum I'm ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being impatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another hour to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life and helps you get through long days.
1274	19241	7	3	At one point in life you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one point in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to Six Flags. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the car. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at Six Flags; the first ride I saw was the Goliath. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted ninety seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn't know and it only lasted ninety seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the ride, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient.
1275	19242	7	3	I remember one time I was patient, it was when my grandma called and said she was go send me fifty dollars. So I asked her when she was to send it and she said Friday. Today was Monday so that mean I had to wait four days. So the next day had came up and the mail truck came by and I thought I had money but it wasn't Friday yet, so I said, “Darn it.” Wednesday came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the day can past by “Forget it! So then it was Thursday they had my favorite game on sale “The Bully” the case had a yellow sticker that said fifty and no tax at all, so I was mad and sadly went home. My dad woke me up and said “its Friday” I jumped up, I rose up ate breakfast then I check the mail, it was bills, bills,bills and “my money” my grandma sent me an envelope. At last I said I have money, so I bought some ice cream and I bought my favorite game “Bully”. That’s the time when I was patient and it paid off in the end.
1276	19243	7	3	Patience in basketball involves understanding and being tolerant, which are essential qualities for any team sport. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to the team; your time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the basketball court during a game. Our team, the Carmen Ainsworth girls basketball team, was competing against Flushing. A young lady from Flushing was awarded free throws after a foul call, though truthfully I didn't even see the foul and I'm not even sure if it happened, but you can't argue with the officials. She was shooting her free throws and she was taking forever, meticulously preparing for each shot. I'm surprised her shot wasn't blocked by time itself. What was she waiting for, a new basketball? I didn't say anything out loud. I just stood there, nice and patient, waiting for the play to continue. Eventually, the girl shot the ball, and she didn't make either of her attempts. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself for maintaining my composure; I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that the whole time I was standing there I didn't make a face, or say anything, or even think something negative in my head! I was just standing tall for the first shot, minding my own business and watching to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot, I prepared myself by assuming the box out position: I sat down, put my butt down, hands out, and faced the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot after the attempt. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound, my teammate scored a point, and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposition. Nobody's perfect, and you'll have to wait and see who will score the next point, which is all part of the game.
1277	19244	7	3	"It was my first game of the season and I was pumped, ready to go in at a moment's notice. The coach yelled ""big guy"" and I was immediately by his side, eager for my chance. Then he said next play you're going in, filling me with anticipation. Then the assistant coach said no, I wasn't allowed to go in after all. The whole time I didn't complain or show my frustration. I never said one word of protest to anyone. Instead, I helped other people by fetching water and offering encouragement. It was still fun being part of the team atmosphere. The whole time, at least I didn't complain and make it worse for everyone else by having a negative attitude. The whole time I was on the sidelines, cheering for my teammates. I never went in, not once, for the entire game. I was very patient throughout the experience. Not to say I wasn't mad internally; I was very frustrated. At least I got some exercise just from standing and moving around on the sideline. The whole time I supported my teammates, I encouraged them, and I helped in any way, shape, or form that I could. I listened to them complain about their own playing time, but I did not join in; I only gave support. There I was, so mad I could have killed, I was ready to play but my coach said no. It was my time to shine, I felt, but that one stupid word, ""no,"" stood in my way. But at least I learned something about being a good teammate even when things don't go your way."
1278	19245	7	3	Hunting, specifically when you are turkey hunting, requires you to be extremely still and quiet, which means you have to have a lot of patience. If you move even a single muscle or make a slight sound, all the turkeys will spook and run away. Sometimes you will be sitting for hours and hours in one spot, just waiting on that one perfect shot opportunity. I remember when I was hunting with my dad in the woods, sitting silently under a large tree for probably three hours, and finally a small group of turkeys came into view. Unfortunately, just about when I had a shot lined up in my sights, my dad shifted his weight and scared them all away with a sudden noise. But I still had the patience to stay out there in the blind for another two hours, hoping for another chance. That experience is my prime example of having patience while hunting.
1279	19246	7	3	One day, two years ago, I was going to visit the city on the Amtrak train. The line for boarding was incredibly long, and we were told it was a two-hour wait just to get to the front. Once we finally got to the front of the line, we had to go all the way back to the end because my mom realized she had forgotten the physical tickets at home. So now we had to wait another two hours to get back to the beginning of the line, which was frustrating. Once we got to the counter again, the guy told us that we could have just told him our name and he could have found our tickets online, which would have saved us all that time. My mom got really mad at that point, but eventually we got it sorted out and we got to go on the Amtrak train, which was a really fun ride once it started. That's the time I had to be patient for over four hours while standing in extreme heat, a true test of endurance.
1280	19247	7	3	In my opinion, being patient is when you're waiting your turn for something without getting upset or frustrated. And being impatient means not waiting your turn and trying to rush ahead of others. Throughout your whole life you will need patience because sometimes you might just have to wait for things to happen. I have patience, and I know a lot of people who have patience too. I was raised to have patience; when you're doing something, don't rush through it because you can mess up the outcome. Conversely, don't go way too slow either because then people will think you don't know how to do it properly. You can just go at your own pace so you can get the task done right and the way you want it to be done. People who don't have patience aren't always happy all the time, as they often feel frustrated by delays and obstacles.
1281	19248	7	3	Have you ever had to be patient before? I have, and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday, my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone, but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited, and then @DATE2 finally came. More months passed, and I still hadn’t heard from my uncle. I began to become frustrated with him because he had promised me that phone. I told my mom about my disappointment, and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience; so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my head, a little? It’s been almost a year! Then on @DATE1, my uncle came over for my family reunion. He told me he knew that I thought he forgot about the phone. I knew he was right, but just then a little light bulb went off in my head—he couldn’t have forgotten about it. Soon it was time to eat, and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give him a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something, he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting, and in this case, it was. So whenever your patience is being tested, keep your cool; it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story, I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The @CAPS3.
1282	19249	7	3	You will say that you are bored very fast. Most people are, because when you get out in the woods there's nothing you can do except watch and wait; if you make one noise you will see nothing your whole hunt. Hunting is all about patience, but it is a great reward when that doe, buck, or whatever you’re hunting is right in your sight. There are times that I have been impatient, and there are times that I have been patient. When I was younger I was very impatient; I would get up and walk around. But when I got older I got more patient, like when I got my first deer; it was an eight-point buck. Hunting in @MONTH1 takes patience, but I like it and it’s fun. The feeling of success makes all the waiting worthwhile.
1283	19250	7	3	One time I was patient was when I had to get some @CAPS1 done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @CAPS1. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited; I decided to watch an episode of Spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasn’t done! So I made some bagel bites, which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1... and so on I got to @NUM2 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate; I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but she wasn't. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2; I got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer; it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and relaxing. I got out, went upstairs to change, and came downstairs. Surprisingly, my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my @CAPS1. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long for my turn on the computer.
1284	19251	7	3	"One time I was impatient was when we were on our way to see the point. The whole family was with us. We all were in @NUM1 car and vans. I was in the van @NUM2 and the car had @NUM3 in it. It was like a @NUM3 hour drive. I was in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We were stuck in traffic for like an hour. First I was on the phone, then I was just having a family talk, but after like an hour I was so impatient. And all I could hear was my mom saying, ""Be patient, we're gonna get there."" I’m like, ""No, no, I want to be there @CAPS1."" She’s like, ""We got all day."" Then we stopped to get something to eat, and finally, we were there. It felt like such a long journey, but we made it in the end."
1285	19253	7	3	One time I had to use patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 o'clock @CAPS2 time, and in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am. I was very tired of being patient; I’m not a very patient person, so my mom was very proud of how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult, but the outcome was great! We finally arrived and could start our vacation, which made all the waiting worthwhile.
1286	19254	7	3	Being patient is hard, and I absolutely hate waiting. I hate waiting for things days to come up, for mail or packages to arrive, for people to show up, for anything at all. Patience requires a kind of mental effort that I simply don't have. I really have never been a patient person, and I don't know many people who are either. There is my mom who ìclaimsî to be patient, but honestly, shes is not! I think one of my least favorite phrases in the entire world is ìbe patientî! I immediately tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times in a row. I am patent only when I want to be, which is never, or when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isnít up yet, and that feeling of being trapped is unbearable.
1287	19255	7	3	When I was @NUM1 yrs old my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She was going to make a special, handmade blanket just for me. Sadly she didnít find the blanket she had started, or perhaps she lost the pattern. I have to be patient, I told myself. I had waited and it wasnít done, then my @DATE1 came and went. My @DATE1 was almost @NUM2 months ago now, and still no blanket. She finally found a time to look for it, hoping that she would find the missing pieces in @NUM3. I have been patient and every year on my @DATE1 and on @CAPS1 I ask if it is fiished but Iím not. I suppose I can be patient for alittle while longer, but my hope is starting to fade with each passing year.
1288	19256	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was fishing with my dad. We where fishing on a cold, dark night and no fish where bighting, not even a nibble. I was just @CAPS1 ther being patient, calmly eating sun flower seeds and passing the time. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning to the backeasard celtcs games on a small radio. We where only catching little fish that night, nuthing big enough to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down, which was freezing. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent, he was furious. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didnít have a spare so we drove home slowly on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing I to start most of her sentences. That would make it more instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample, but the core story of my patience remains true.
1289	19257	7	3	When I was patient I was sitting at a restront with my family. And I ordered my drink and mike was the first one to get his. Then when we got our food they said my order would take about five more minutes so I sat there waiting. It was fifteen minutes later when she came back and had made the wrong food so I was losing my patientís quickly. so then I just relaxed and took a deep breath, trying not to get upset. She came back with my meal thes time it was, finally, the right one so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast, barely tasting it. so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixup they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patient`s I had shown. And thats when I was very patient, and it actually paid off in the end.
1290	19258	7	3	We were going to @CAPS1 for a family trip. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting in line to ride the skyline ride. After we ate, me my cousins and my aunt??? headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole view??? of cedar point from above. ìim so excitedî said one of my sisters. ìyaa me too!î said the the other. We were walking towards it, our pace quickening. It took really long to get there. When we saw the line we heaked! It was incredibly long. ìthis will take so longî said my sister. I was so surprised my @NUM1-year- ol cousin her??? didn't complain. ìwow it look really highî said my cousin, a little nervous. ì@CAPS2ít, worry we have @CAPS3 with us. Sheíll take care of usî said my younger sister, reassuring her. Finally it was our turn to board. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us, jumping up and down and wanting to go on so badly. ìwhy @CAPS2ít you go aheadî said my cousin to them. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually she had to start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin for being so kind. We had a great time there on the ride, and the view was amazing. I hope we come back again someday to make more memories.
1291	19259	7	3	"Patience is a hard thing to have, but there are rewards to having it. I had a band teacher who was notoriously forgetful, and no one could remember him giving us our report cards. So after a few weeks of waiting, I made a lighthearted bet with him that if he didn’t bring us our report cards the next day, he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally it was the end of the school year. And he still didn’t have them. Once schools started up again and we were halfway through the next school year, my band teacher walked in and gave me two packs of Skittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said, ""Yes, but you are only supposed to give me one."" He told me with a smile, ""The second one is for being too patient."" It was a small gesture, but it perfectly illustrated the unexpected benefits of waiting calmly."
1292	19260	7	3	Patience is a valuable thing. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do conditioning practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It takes a great deal of patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half, unable to join them. Every Tuesday and Thursday I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to simply not go to the games, but I have patience, so I go. It is very boring to just sit there, but I do it so I can watch and learn, hoping to play again next year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything worthwhile. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when you're sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone; it is when you are calm and waiting without frustration, knowing that your time will come.
1293	19261	7	3	The one time when I was patient was on the state test of last year. Some of the ways I was patient was by keeping to myself or, as you know it, being quiet. The state test is not that hard, but when you have to have patience, that's when it gets hard for you, and for me. Patience is key because you will have to use it for a long time in life! But let's get back on track, shall we? On the state test, when you are done, you have to wait for your classmates to be done. So in that spare time, you can read a book or quietly check over your work. Patience is also important because when you are taking the state test you can't rush through it; you have to take your time and know that you are timed. That's where patience comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the state test you can just sit there and think about what you did today; the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom doesn't have patience, you are most likely to fail the state test. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if everybody in the room is being silent, then you can and will do good. When I take the state test I show patience when I am done because I care about other people's work habits during the test. I understand that you don't have the state test anymore, but it is about being patient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade, I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had patience! And remember, patience is the key thing to success on tests and in life.
1294	19262	7	3	"One day at school, a student was waiting in line to get his lunch when out of the blue, a few kids popped right in front of him. The student said to the kids, ""You know you have to go to the back of the line, right?"" ""No we don't,"" said the kid. Then a few minutes later, a girl named Sarah (that the student likes) was going to the way back of the line, but the student said she could cut in front of him. So she did. Once the student and his friend got up to where they got their food, they were waiting to pay for it when the kid a few spots away from Sarah couldn't remember his student ID number. It turned out he was a new student, so they had to make him a student ID number right there before he paid for his food. Finally they got through the line. Sarah sat down with her friends, but the student had nowhere to sit because his friends were outside. So Sarah saw him and asked if he wanted to sit with her, so he did. Finally, he was done eating, and Sarah asked if the student wanted to hang out at recess and he said sure, but one of Sarah's friends was not done eating so they had to wait for her. When she was done, they went outside. This was what the student was waiting for, but just then the bell rang to go inside. He was a little mad, but he got to hang out with Sarah the whole time waiting, which made it all worthwhile."
1295	19263	7	3	Last summer, while I was up at my family's cabin, my stepdad taught my brothers, friends, and I how to water-ski. It being a daring activity, I am not really the adventurous type, but I tried first. Using all the steps my stepdad told me to, and being patient with myself, I got prepared in the water. Out of the blue—literally, we were on a lake—I got up on my skis just like a pro! Now I could make all the turns! When the water skiing session came to an end and I brought the boat up to the cabin, I insisted that my younger sister try water skiing at least once. But when we got out to the lake, and I had skied a few times in a row, she was up to here, trying to decide if she was going to try skiing for sure. We sat there for what seemed like half an hour waiting for her decision. But, in the end, she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didn’t try to persuade her or pressure her into trying it. I was very patient with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I am still proud of myself to this day for the patience I showed on that boat.
1296	19264	7	3	"When I was about seven years old, my mom used to be impatient all the time and got so annoyed at little things! But then one day, she was going to take a shower, but then people kept on going into the bathroom, and she had to wait. She got patient for a while, and I went up there. I saw her and hid. As I peeked from end to end of the hallway, she was still standing there, almost falling asleep, and she was still displaying patience. Another person stepped into the bathroom, and I quickly went there and said, ""Excuse me, but my mom is coming, she’s been waiting."" So I woke up my mom, ""Mom, mom, wake up, go take a shower!"" and she woke up and took the shower. After she came out, she said, ""Ahh, it kind of feels good. That was better."" I learned a lot about waiting from watching her that day."
1297	19265	7	3	"When I was about seven and my mom was pregnant with my younger sister, it was the night before she had her. We were all asleep when my mom started to scream; we all went into her room. My dad asked her what was going on, and she said, ""She's coming!"" My dad raced to the car, put it into gear, and left without us and my mom, who was about to have a baby. Then, when my dad realized he forgot us, he came back home to pick us up. It was already morning by then. They took us to a room at the hospital and prepared my mom. Me and my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then, when they took her to get an ultrasound, we had to wait some more. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the delivery room; we were so patient as it took over an hour to get her out. When they were stitching my mom up, they brought my little sister to get all cleaned up. We could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath and shots, and when they put those patches on her, I had thought she was an alien. But when they brought her to our room, my mom looked exhausted, and my beautiful baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us for being so patient waiting for our little sister. She said she would name her Lily, and we all liked that name. I was so happy that day, a memory I will always cherish."
1298	19266	7	3	"Patience is something not very many people truly have. I am in between; I can be patient at times, but at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant of delays. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I'm not that patient, and every year we go to Mackinac Island for Labor Day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t complain, you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge because I had pulled muscles in both my legs, and the night before, embers from a fire had burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge, I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time, and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself ""be patient"" over and over, and then I sped up, going past the first three miles in forty minutes because my legs were worn out. I knew to beat our record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could, and my legs felt like they were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, but my legs kept telling me ""Keep going!"" My mind wouldn’t let me stop; it was tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted that fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line, not only to get fudge but also to beat our record. Thanks to patience, I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient, so thank goodness for patience when it counts!"
1299	19267	7	3	"A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and understanding. Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood, I have to be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day last year, I was feeling sick and upset; it was during summer vacation, and my little sister Chloe wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream truck that rode by every twenty minutes—she wanted it from the ice-cream shop, which was about seven to ten blocks away. I was buried in my blanket when she jumped onto my bed. ""Hey, hey, I want to go get ice-cream. Please, please, please!!!"" she chanted. ""No,"" I said in a mean voice. ""Chloe, you little hobgoblin, get off my bed or I will get you!"" I was younger and in a terrible mood that crying sounded so silly and stupid. Tears came to her eyes, and I didn’t realize at that moment that she was little, only four years old, and didn’t quite understand that I didn’t feel good. I apologized and explained that I was sick. Immediately after, she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea, and Chloe said, ""I made mama make you some tea."" That was heartwarming to me. After I drank it, Chloe asked if I felt better. I said a little, then Chloe got on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and knew that she didn’t fully understand yet. So I got up and took her to the ice-cream shop to get some ice-cream. Chloe was happy, and that made me happy. I felt extremely proud that I was patient with Chloe even when she got on my nerves. I know I wasn’t patient with Chloe at the beginning, but at the end I was, and that's what mattered most."
1300	19268	7	3	"It was a sunny Saturday morning and we were up at the lake house. We all wanted to go on the boat and go tubing. We went cared out to the boat and got all ready to go; we tried to start the boat, but there was nothing. My uncle and cousin took the back of the seats off and peered into the back; there was boat-loads of water—the bilge pump had stopped working. My step-dad took a look at them and said that it was going to be re-wired. He had soon re-wired the boat, and it still hadn’t worked. All the kids were now getting antsy and starting to complain. Every adult said we needed to have patience. Everybody had now calmed down and walked away to find other things to do. Pretty soon we heard a boat start up that sounded like my uncle’s; we ran down there with excitement and, sure enough, it was started. We hopped in and there we went, tubing down the river, the wind in our hair. Later that day, my mom had said to me, ""Patience is a virtue,"" and I finally understood what she meant. It was a good lesson learned on a beautiful day."
1301	19270	7	3	I’m constantly patient mostly because of my younger sister. Sometimes it's easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I’m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly autumn evening I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked “Mom, how did you get so good at putting make-up?” She responded “with patience and years of practice.” The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom “Hey mom, can we go to the store, later?” Mom replies “Why, sweetie?” I answered “So I can get some make-up to practice with”. “Okay.” Mom says. When we get there, there’re so many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones, and she showed me a few basic items. After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn’t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and she said “Don't worry, I know you’ll catch on soon!” and I wondered out loud “Why does it matter?”, Mom almost said as a whisper “because anyone can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patience to learn it their self.” I realized then that patience truly is a valuable skill to learn.
1302	19271	7	3	When my mom and I got into the checkout line at the grocery store, we heard impatient groans and sighs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed with people rushing to get their items. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait and shifting my weight from one foot to the other. My mom continued her cheerful whistling, and didn’t seem to notice the commotion. “Mom this is going to take forever!” I whined. “Don't be so negative. It’s not that long.” she replied. She saw my responding glare and chuckled. “How about we play a game?” We continued a game of eye spy for fifteen minutes or so as the line slowly progressed, spotting a red box and a blue sign. After we finished our game, mom continued to make small talk about our dinner plans, and then checked her list to make sure we had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon we were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing mom kept us occupied! As we walked out of the store my mom said, “See, when you’re patient, you get food!” We both laughed and drove home, the earlier frustration completely forgotten.
1303	19272	7	3	Every year me and my entire family take a trip to the coast to the sunny beach. Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad, my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel suite together, which usually has four bedrooms, so it's a bit cozy but fun. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks, which always feels much too short. So I have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days, counting down on my calendar. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays from the pier, hang out on the beach building sandcastles, and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait for all that fun. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year, dreaming of the warm sand and ocean waves.
1304	19273	7	3	I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to the amusement park. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours, through winding country roads. I was really excited about going on the new ride at the park- the Maverick. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window at passing fields, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides first. We usually start at the front and work back, doing things in order, which is our family's tradition. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big roller coasters with a few exceptions for rides like the antique cars, the spinning tea cups, and the log flume. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the Maverick with how much fun I was having at the time, screaming and laughing. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the Maverick since the line was nearly an hour and a half long, snaking back and forth. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride and very popular. After waiting for so long we finally got to ride it, buckling into the sleek cars. The Maverick was amazingly epic, with fast drops and sharp turns. Finally, all of my patience had paid off, and I had a great day that I will always remember.
1305	19274	7	3	I’m going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist for a check-up. My sister was so happy, clapping her little hands together. Also my mama had to go to other places too, which made for a long afternoon. First, we went to the mall to get me a homecoming dress, looking through several different stores. After that, we had to go to the shoe store to get me some shoes to match the dress. Third, I went to go get my hair done at the salon, which took almost an hour. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist, reminding her of the appointment. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait twenty minutes in the waiting room, looking at magazines. I told my little sister “I.M.G this whole day you have been so patient. I couldn’t do that.” She just smiled, happy to finally be at the place she was looking forward to all day.
1306	19275	7	3	Why wasn't my uncle there yet? Come on! I was saying I had trapped myself, my back was pinned, and the only thing I had to call for help with was my cell phone. Where was Uncle @PERSON1 from @CAPS1? All I could do was quickly look back to see what was wrong: I was at my uncle's house waiting for him to hurry up so we could go hunting. I couldn't wait. Opening the truck door very quietly and slipping out with my @NUM1 gauge, I then ran out into the woods and into my tree stand. We had had this stand for as long as I could remember. That, I now see, was a bad thing. The ladder was old and rotten, and it felt like it would break. The top platform bowed and had broken quite a few times in different spots. We kept telling ourselves that we would rebuild it, but we never got to it. So after carefully climbing up the shaky ladder, I let the gun rest at my side and waited. Hunting required a lot of patience, but I didn't need any that day. There, standing on the horizon of the tree line, was the biggest buck I had ever seen; I almost said aloud it was so beautiful. Loading a shell into the barrel, I took aim and... Boom! I shot and missed my luck! The stand tilted violently to the side. I reached for the gun so I could put it on the platform, but it slipped and slid down, hitting the edge. The gun landed bent against the tree. I turned just in time to see the stand coming down. I turned so I was facing the falling structure and tried to get up, but I had sprained my leg. Then with a great crash!!! The stand fell on me. I was trapped beneath it, my back pinned. I tried to move, but my back hurt too bad and my arms were starting to bleed. I was lucky I didn't break my neck, and so my problem was I wasn't patient at first. But I learned my lesson the hard way and was patient enough to wait until my uncle was within yelling distance. I got in trouble, and learned the hard way to be patient.
1307	19276	7	3	"So one day in fifth grade I was running around playing tag on the playground when, ""push,"" I got pushed off the slide. I fell and landed on my arm so it went numb, and then it was in pain so badly. My mom took me to the doctor's and we waited for two hours. I just sat patiently by not moving my arm at all, watching other people walk in and out. Finally, they called my name. They told me my arm was broken but they could not put a cast on there. So we went to the other doctor's office across the road, waited @NUM1 minutes, and I got a blue cast. About a month later I got it taken off and went back to the x-ray room, but then the doctor said I had to cast it up again. This time I got a red cast, and eventually I got it taken off for good. And that's the time I was patient."
1308	19277	7	3	The time I was patient was when I went to the @CAPS1 graduation at @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training; he was there for like @NUM1 months. At the end, if they made it through, they got an award. So there was kind of a lot of people in the audience. We had to dress really nice for the formal ceremony. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didn't even know. The worst part was they gave long speeches. Then after what seemed like hours, my dad finally got up to receive his award! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient.
1309	19278	7	3	"Go! @CAPS5 coach yelled. The @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. My whole day was planned, first soccer then my friend's birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain drop pound down on my head. Before I knew it I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started pouring. My team and I rushed under a nearby awning. Boom! The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally the refs came over and announced, ""the game has been delayed."" I sighed and slouched down on a picnic table. I knew now I would have to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slammed down on the roof and thunder cracked. ""How would I make it to my party now?"" I thought. Boom! Boom! Boom! More thunder came. It had to go @NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already on minute @NUM2. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at @NUM3. We were now at minute @NUM4. We listened closely until we heard a boom! From far north. Frustrated, I said, ""Oh my gosh, come on!"" My team began to count the minutes again. Finally, after the longest @NUM1 minutes of my life, there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! My team and I sprinted on to the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly, we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field with our white socks and jerseys splattered with mud. Every one of us were sopping wet. My mom gave me the ""hurry up"" look and I quickly ran to the car. ""I will still make it to my party but, I will be just a few minutes late and I have to change in the car,"" I said to myself. As I sprinted through the wet grass I heard my coach yell from behind me, ""Have fun at your party @PERSON1, and thanks for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied, ""Thanks coach!"" That day I realized being patient is a good quality to have. Many people appreciate it when you are understanding and don't complain during difficult times."
1310	19280	7	3	On the way back home from a doctor's appointment, I was getting annoyed about being stuck in traffic. I did not want my mom to get annoyed more, so I tried a great deal to be patient. Once in a while I would play with the seat belt or look out the window. @NUM1 minutes have passed and I was getting more impatient, but I still kept my composure and stayed quiet. Once I finally got home, I went to my bed and relaxed, glad I had managed to stay calm.
1311	19281	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to get the money for our chiuahuce @CAPS1. It was @DATE1 and my dada sold his giutar to his uncle to get money for the day of coarse he didn’t have it. A day went by and still nothing, which was frustrating. When my mom came and picked his ??? I went to swim practice trying to be patient and wait for my dad to get the money. At around @NUM1íoclock my dad called saying he won’t get the money till @DATE2 @TIME1! I was mad, but still tried to be patient and not let my disappointment show. A few days went by and soon it was @DATE1 again. I was so excited. We finally got @CAPS2 I had been patiently waiting for a week and was tired of it. So when I was him my patience was worth it. That was the time I had to be patient for something good. It had really paid off in the end.
1312	19282	7	3	Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school and how do you use patience there. A way is being understanding to your teacher because they’re there to help you to teach you for life. If you don’t be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life, as learning requires time and effort. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them since they were tolerant with you when you were growing up. If you don’t have patience with you parents and don’t listen to them then you won’t learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life. Patience is truly a key virtue for success.
1313	19283	7	3	Once I knew a girl whos name was @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseperable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular, leaving @PERSON1 behind. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lieing to @PERSON1 saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off, which hurt @PERSON1's feelings. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it, they weren't interested. She then apologized to @PERSON1 for how she was acting. @ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @PERSON1 really was a true friend and was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come from it.
1314	19285	7	3	One time I got in trouble for getting a @CAPS1 on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went up stairs to read a book, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. A hour later I came down and asked. How long am I grounded? She said I don’t know how meny times do I have to ask you to tell. Sow I was buging her all day, following her from room to room. She said I am running out of patients. I said can you just tell me she said okay. She pulled out a sheet of papper. I said what is that? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times ”yikes”! My said twelve days and that is final, I said okay, realizing my mistake. I think I lerend a lesson today? Don’t bug your mom all day and do better in school!
1315	19286	7	3	One sunny beutful day I went out and was driving my glad around and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said she was going to go get my new good in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and she said I couldn’t go @CAPS5 I sat down waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting, trying to distract myself. Then I decided to play playstation @NUM1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) @CAPS5 I was playing far two hours strait, and then I decided to go watch @CAPS6 assassain (@CAPS7) to pass more time. After that was com I went back to play in playstation @NUM1(p.s.@NUM1.), again. played it for another hour, feeling the anticipation build. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep, @CAPS5 I look out the window, and it was my . @CAPS1 ma. Then we talked bout the new qlad and then I hear beep, beep and it was my . my . new @CAPS8!. Then I ran out took it out and roud it for like @NUM3 hours strait. That is how I had patient for about @NUM4 to @NUM5 hours long. I was proud of myself after I was done riding my new @CAPS8, glad I had waited so patiently.
1316	19287	7	3	I was patient when I was in a doctor's appointment or a clinic appointment to wait in the waiting room. My teacher sometimes says wait a minute because teachers are talking to someone else. When I have any question, my teacher says don't open it so I always been patient when someone tells me to wait. I also be patient when I'm waiting for the buses, airplanes, and trains to come. I be patient when I'm bored to wait sometimes, finding ways to pass the time quietly. That's how I've been patient in many different situations throughout my day.
1317	19289	7	3	I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patience. I had to use patience when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box controller. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box, carefully examining each part. All I did was sit in a chair and watch him work, trying not to interrupt. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours of effort. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again, which was very frustrating. So then we had to take the game to the repair shop and have them look at it. I had to have patience because if I didn't I would have been really bored and upset. Once the technician looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it more closely. It took the repair shop almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patience so the system could be delivered properly. Patience is a very needed thing in life, as this experience clearly showed me. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have a lot of patience.
1318	19290	7	3	"""Come on,"" said my little brother. ""This line is taking forever. This is the last time we are coming on this ride."" The ride that we were on was Space Mountain at Disneyland in Florida. As we got into line at the ride there was a sign I saw and it said a ninety minute wait from this point. It was hot and it felt like I was walking a mile. The line would not go any faster, inching forward slowly. My older brother was happy for some reason, which was confusing. No one could understand we were standing in line in hot weather. I was being as patient as I could be I just stood in line quietly, hoping to myself we could get on the ride sooner. The first hour went by and another sign came up saying two hours from this point. We all got mad at the new information. The walkway sounded silent, with few people talking. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as a drop of someone's sweat hit the ground. Everyone was being patient, even though it was difficult. Finally we waited three hours to go on just one ride. That was the first time I was that patient for such a long time."
1319	19291	7	3	"One time when I was patient was when I was in the car going up north to the mountains. I was in the car for eight hours my cousin Sarah was driving and my aunt was in the seat next to her. I was in the backseat with their dog Rover. My cousin Sarah and my aunt were talking the whole way there, having a long conversation. I tried asking to stop and go to the bathroom and get food but they said ""not yet"" so I waited and waited an hour went by so I tried asking again I got the same answer ""not yet"" so that's when I asked for patience to help me through the long journey, and I eventually managed to stay calm until we arrived."
1320	19292	7	3	"One sunny afternoon I was so excited because I was going to see my favorite band. When I was in school, I could hardly concentrate! My mom picked me up from third grade I was so excited it was time to go. My dad dropped my brother off at my grandma's house (he was only a toddler so he could not go.) I was bouncing off my seat asking ""mom are we there yet?"" I asked. ""No, we have two more hours until we are there, then another hour, so we are going to see the place here,"" mom said. ""Okay, can I have my d.v.d please,"" I said, hoping to pass the time. So now it has been two hours I've been in the car, watching the scenery pass. Then we went everywhere my mom and dad wanted to go not where I wanted to, running a few errands. Then it was finally time to go see The Rock Concert performance! When we arrived I was a little sleepy but that would not stop me from enjoying the show. When they only played two songs I wanted to sleep on the seat, feeling tired from the long day. I waited all day to see them and I went to see the performance, which made the patience worthwhile. That was a time I was patient to see my favorite band, and it was a valuable lesson in waiting for something good."
1321	19293	7	3	I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasnít even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited through the final days of summer, counting down until the school year started, but my mom told I would have to wait another week because she didnít have the money from all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another long week, trying not to ask about it every day. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents plan a trip to @LOCATION1 that weeket, a family visit that had been scheduled for months, so I had to wait another week, my anticipation growing. It was on the following @DATE1 when I was at my cousinís house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone, a sleek, modern device still in its box, and I was so happy that I finally got it, holding it carefully in my hands. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient, and the waiting makes the reward feel even sweeter.
1322	19294	7	3	One christmas about a year or two ago we drove up to my grandparents house. They live in cold water so it took about @NUM1 hours through snowy, winding roads. All my relatives on my dads side were there, filling the house with noise and laughter. All the presents were under the tree, a colorful and tempting pile, and I couldn`t wait to open them, my eyes fixed on the boxes. The parents were just talking about nonsense, catching up on family news, so I opened my big mouth and said ìcan we open presents now,î we stated to open the presents but the adults had to go first, as is the tradition. They are the slowest gifts openers ever, carefully peeling back each piece of tape, and I was about to rip the presents out of their hand`s and open the presents myself. I didn`t do that thought because I was being patient, sitting on my hands to stop myself. After they finished, taking what felt like forever, I said,îyesî of course thought my little cousins had to open next, their small hands fumbling with the wrapping paper. Let me tell you they aren`t fast at all either, needing help with every ribbon and bow. After that, the moment finally arrived, and I got to open my presents, tearing into the paper with glee. In the end it was worth it I got an x-box @NUM2, and over @MONEY1, a fantastic haul that made all the waiting completely worthwhile. That was the time I was patient and learned that good things come to those who wait.
1323	19295	7	3	Patient is a very hard thing to do in life. Itís one of those things that is so impossible for people to do some times, even for little kids who struggle to wait their turn. You can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting their turn without complaining about it, standing calmly in line. Sometimes people donít like being patient I know I donít lik to a lot @CAPS1, it feels frustrating and slow. People who are not patient tend to @MONTH1 be not ??? tuned others wait, often interrupting or showing their frustration openly. But people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet donít talk very much, even when they do talk they ??? talking when people inturupt them, simply waiting to be heard. And they defiantly donít yell as someone out at all, maintaining their composure. Itís a good thing to have patiencets because you will grow up with an ??? (part not legible) good family, good friends and a ??? more peaceful life, as you learn to navigate delays without anger. So in conclusion that;s why itís good to be patient, as it helps you build stronger relationships and a calmer disposition.
1324	19296	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the book story and I woned a book. I was at the book store and I wanted a book called tayler swift back at the @LOCATION1 as a school girl and my mom said if you are patient then yes, and I was so happy because she know I love tayler swift book and her life, a story I was desperate to read. As soon as I got it I stared reading it, captivated by the first chapter. My mom said thank you for being patient I was you welcome I said thank you for buying it, feeling a warm gratitude. I have told my mom that if we could go to the book store and she said not today, her voice firm, and I keep on asking and she said not again, a little more sternly, and I keep on asking and she said maybe, finally giving me a glimmer of hope. So I was and the car listen to radio and we when to the mall, not knowing if we would stop, and there was a book store in the mall and I ask if I could look around and my mom said yes, a simple permission that made my heart leap, and she said find the bok that you wonted I find it, pulling it from the shelf with care, and she bote it. This is a time I was patient, resisting the urge to nag constantly. One thing I learn is to be patient if you want something and dont keep asking, because sometimes the answer will come when you wait quietly.
1325	19297	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went hunting. I am patient when I go hunting because I know that at an moment the back of a life time could walk out in shouting range, a chance you cannot force. And if one does I will be ready, my senses sharp and focused. The first time I shot a deer was with my baw, a moment I had practiced for. And I remember siting there being as patient as I could, the cold seeping into my bones, waiting for a deer to step within range. Then l hear the leaves cranching, a soft, deliberate sound in the quiet woods. The there it is the deer Iím going to shout?? How you draw it back, the movements slow and deliberate to avoid detection. Than I shoot I could feel the arrow gliding throw my bow, a smooth release of tension. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud and the deer takes off, crashing into the underbrush. I wanted there in my tree stand ready to go blame my deer, my heart pounding with a mix of excitement and solemnity. Me and my dad traked it about soft, following the faint trail, and there it was, a successful harvest. I was so excited that all yelled, a burst of pride and relief. It was nice to know that all my patients and hard work had payed of, resulting in this tangible reward. Thank you for reading my story, and I hope you enjoyed this glimpse into a hunter's required virtue.
1326	19298	7	3	Patience it take a lot to have patience. One time my sister was trying to hate me but I didn’t let her get to me, and I have patience until I get mad. So I’m watching tv and she was standing in the task, and she asked me over and over “can you move off in front of the tv?” and she moved. She sat by me and kept on touching me, but it didn’t bother me at all. She kept saying “I’m going to make you mad” and I said “I’m not going to get mad until I make myself mad, so you don’t bother me, get out my face.” I really get mad so she tried her best by trying to rip up my homework, so I said I don’t care. She had a smart comment, whatever, and I keep watching tv, so I was so patient with her. She said I’m going to make you mad so I ignored her. She got mad and kept saying do you hear me, so I just walked outside and said to myself I can’t let her get to me because we might end up fighting. I went back in the house and sat down and I told her you can’t make me mad so you might want to stop. So she said girl whatever and I was so ready to say something but I wasn’t going to give her nothing to feed off. In the end, my patience helped me avoid a bigger argument and I felt stronger for it.
1327	19300	7	3	I am writing about when someone was patient. My mom was patient when she didn't get her money that day. She wanted it to come but it did not, so she was mad for a minute, but the next day it came. And I said I told you mommy it was coming today. She did get her money, yes, and she had been waiting for it. That one day she did not know where it was, so she did not know what to do when it did not arrive. And she was patient by not calling the people and asking them where is her money at and things, and the next day she had the money. There was nobody at home then, but I was there too, then we went to the store. They had the money and got everything we needed. We went to the mall after and I was so happy, me and my brothers and sisters. It was a good lesson in how waiting calmly can make everything turn out alright in the end.
1328	19301	7	3	I remember when I went to my step-grandmother's house to visit my step-grandmother for the summer and went fishing. I didn’t really want to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the ‘backyard’. I flung my fishing line into the water and waited. After maybe ten minutes of nothing, except my sister who caught most things, the line finally started to unravel. Excited, I leapt out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the reel. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step grandmother threw the fish back. After another ten minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster than before. I’d caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move again. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience led to me catching the biggest fish of the day and learning something new about the value of waiting calmly.
1329	19302	7	3	Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that is patient. An example of being patient is, let's say you're standing in line for two hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting two hours in line is being patient to get the tickets, without complaining or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didn't have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: everyone would be waiting for things too. Everyone would be trying to be first all the time. It could just be crazy and nothing would get done properly. So I’m happy that there is patience in this world and that many people have it, as it helps keep our daily lives peaceful and orderly.
1330	19303	7	3	I was patient when I had a doctor's appointment. Me and my mom had been waiting almost an hour for them to call me. Twenty minutes later the nurse finally calls me. She says sorry for your wait and thank you for being patient. Then after that my mom took me to get something to eat, so we went to a drive-through. We were waiting another fifteen minutes later when they give us our food from the drive-through window. The worker also said sorry and thanks for being patient. It felt good to be acknowledged for waiting calmly, and it made the rest of the day much more pleasant.
1331	19304	7	3	This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it, choosing to wait calmly instead. For example, I had to give my mom some money, but I did not have the money right then and there. My mom did not complain; she waited quietly because she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep begging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant of the situation. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza without pestering him. When you have patience, people will often have patience with you in return. For example, if you were watching tv and you did not want to get up yet, people might have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does not mean you keep asking repeatedly. For example, I was at the grocery store once, begging my mom for candy, not realizing that if I had just shown a little patience and waited for her answer, I would have gotten the candy, but I didn't. This is my story and what patience means to me.
1332	19305	7	3	A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named Mr. Johnson. He was a very patient man although we often got on his nerves. Even if we didn't understand a question that he had explained a million times, he was still patient and would try again. Even when we got attitudes with him, Mr. Johnson was still a patient man and never raised his voice. I think Mr. Johnson was determined to be patient with us, as he must have prayed for strength because he was always patient with us through thick and thin, during good days and bad. Mr. Johnson was the most patient teacher and person I have ever known, and I will always remember his calm demeanor.
1333	19306	7	3	Patience, what's the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that is the main word in my mind. Here is a story about a time when I was very patient. Every kid dreads standardized testing; it was a Tuesday morning and we had to be completely silent for the entire duration. It is hard enough to be quiet, but it is even harder when you are sitting next to your friends, and you are a girl who loves to talk. We had to do the writing portion, and writing is the worst for me because it takes so long. But when I was finally done, I felt really good, and I remained quiet for everyone else who was still working. That is the story of when I had to be patient and wait silently until the very end.
1334	19307	7	3	Patience can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to restaurants and we wait for our food, I get bored very easily. One time, I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot, so my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor, she felt for a lump or a fracture in my ankle and said, “I don't think there is anything wrong, but we won't be sure without more tests.” Therefore, she sent my mom and me to the urgent care center out on Main Street with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty-five minute car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in, we waited in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while. I had to have patience because we were waiting there for a whole hour, which felt like forever! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle and the long wait only made it more challenging.
1335	19308	7	3	Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is an example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming and I was extremely happy, but I knew I had to wait. I would always count down the days, so I had a personal calendar just for counting down to it. After that, I made lots of birthday lists of things I hoped to get. I went to different stores to see what they had for gifts. For an example, I saw this beautiful shirt that had a matching belt, and I really wanted it. In the final days before my birthday, I was so excited I could hardly eat. I also went to the local bakery and checked out all the wonderful cakes they had. Finally, the day came and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. I conclude that it was all worth the wait because I was patient and did not complain.
1336	19310	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to be patient for having a difficult task without any help. Not one complaint came from me. It was so hard. I had one hour to finish it, but I knew I needed three hours to complete it properly. The test was so challenging that not even a college student could finish it in the allotted time. I focused intently, working through each complex problem step by step, refusing to give up even when the concepts were confusing. The pressure was immense as the clock ticked down, but I remained determined to do my absolute best with the time I had. The @ORGANIZATION1 was the hardest match test I had ever done, and completing it required all the patience I could muster.
1337	19311	7	3	“Mom, how much longer?” I complained at the airport, “We have been waiting for about two hours now.” “It will only be a couple more minutes, sweety,” replied my mom in a stern voice. “It better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to Disney World,” I complained again. As you might know now, we are in an airport full of people. We had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for Florida. It took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really, really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my Gameboy Advance. The Gameboy Advance is a boxy-looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a T.V. that they had at the airport. We went over to the seating area to watch, but the only channel we could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all, so I played my Gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I hadn’t said anything to my mom the past two hours or three hours. I didn’t want to bug her, so I left her alone. When the next hour passed, we boarded our plane finally. We waited a total of six hours and fifteen minutes. It was a painful but memorable experience. When we boarded the plane and found our seats, my mom said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my mom and dad don’t like to fly to places anymore.
1338	19312	7	3	"It was July 12th. It was almost time for Billy's birthday. Billy was going to be six years old. He was helping his mom make his birthday cake. After they were done making the cake mix, Billy's mom put it into a cake pan. She put the pan into the oven for two hours. ""I can't wait for my super yummy chocolate birthday cake to be done!"" said Billy. A few minutes later Billy asked if his cake was ready. ""But Billy,"" said Billy's mom, ""We've still got about one hour and fifty-five minutes until your cake is done."" ""But that will take forever,"" whined Billy. ""You've got to use your patience, Billy,"" she said. ""Mom, what's patience?"" Billy asked. ""Patience is waiting for something without complaining,"" explained Billy's mom. ""Besides, you can do something while the time passes by faster. Like play a game, ride your bike, play with your friends, or play in the sand box."" ""Okay,"" said Billy, ""I'll go do something else."" So Billy went downstairs to play his video games. When he was done playing his video games, he checked the oven to see how much time had gone by. There was two hours and thirty minutes left. So Billy decided to go out and ride his bike. He put on his helmet and got on his two-wheeler bicycle. He went for a ride on the neighborhood trails. He saw his friend and joined them on their bike ride. After their bike ride, Billy asked them if they wanted to go play in the sand box. They all said yes. So they went to the backyard and played in the sand box. Billy and his friends all made this huge sand kingdom. It had big castles and it had a trench all around it. It took up the entire sand box. Billy went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven. ""Mom, how much time is on the oven?"" asked Billy. ""Only five more minutes,"" said his mom, ""you should take that time to brush off all that sand. I see you and your friends are covered in it. And when you're done you can invite them in for a piece of cake."" When Billy and his friends were done getting the sand off of them, they all went inside and had a piece of cake. After everyone finished their cake they all said, ""It's the best cake ever!"""
1339	19313	7	3	“Come on, Mom!” I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; Cedar Point. “Calm down, Alex,” my mom told me. “I’m coming,” she said. I’m not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. It’s also nice to just take a day off and drive up to Cedar Point. I live in Michigan, so the drive isn’t that short. My mom had just finished giving the man our tickets. “Enjoy your day at Cedar Point,” he told us. “So, Alex, what do you want to ride first?” my mom asked me. “How about the Magnum?” I asked my mom. “Why not?” she replied. By the way, if you didn’t know, my name is Alex. But that’s not important right now. What’s important is getting on the Magnum. My mom and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the Magnum isn’t the biggest ride, but it’s still pretty big. To be honest, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The Magnum ended up being a blast! After the Magnum we rode the Mantis, the Raptor, the Wicked Twister, the GateKeeper, the Valravn, The Mean Streak, the Top Thrill Dragster and the Maverick. “All right Alex, pick the last ride,” my mom said. Now that was easy. We still hadn’t gone on my favorite ride yet. “Let’s go on the Millennium Force,” I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. Now, I’ve been on the ride, and it’s definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldn’t be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at Cedar Point, and I’m glad I waited for the best ride.
1340	19314	7	3	It was about the middle of July when my family and I were going to visit my grandparents. They live in mid-Ohio. I was so excited I spent the days before counting down with all of my siblings. We gathered our toys and accessories. I was pumped. Finally, my mom and my brother finished packing the morning of the trip while my dad and I were all set. We packed everything in our old, blue van and we headed off. An hour in I asked my dad, “When are we going to be there?” “Not until much later,” my dad said, so I slept. My brother was being silly and kept poking me in his seat while I was sleeping. We stopped for him at a gas station because my mom had to use the restroom, and I started to get excited again. It was about two o'clock. I had to wait to get to a hotel. I was still happy because we were in mid-Ohio and we would get to see my grandparents and have an awesome time together. That was my story about the time I had to be patient.
1341	19315	7	3	I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait calmly for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inanimate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to rush it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, which can happen, it might end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, though it might end up happening faster. You might also wait for nature too, such as a sunny day when it might have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during a storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your turn or for a feeling to pass, like when you are bored and must simply endure the slow passage of time.
1342	19316	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I broke my thumb. I was patient cause I wasn't complaining about it and I wasn't crying about it. I really wasn't doing anything about it because I didn’t think it was even broken, and it wasn't really bothered me. Then I waited to see the doctor and got it checked; the doctor didn't think it was broken either, especially since I almost beat him in a thumb wrestle, but he x-rayed it just in case. When he came back with the x-rays he said it was broken, and he was very surprised; I was surprised too, and every one was surprised by the news.
1343	19317	7	3	This past summer, my family and I went to Flagstaff. When we were in Flagstaff we were going to the Grand Canyon. It was basically a big ski slope. When we went to the top on a ski lift, I was scared that I was going to fall. When we got to the top I could see Flagstaff and sort of the surrounding area. I got dizzy and I didn’t like heights, and I started to throw up. I was happy to get in line to go down. When I got down I felt better and then I felt like I was going to throw up again. I love my mom and she helped me feel better. That day was the worst day of my life. I was happy the next day when we went to the local museum and had a much calmer time.
1344	19318	7	3	"Sometimes its hard to be patient, especially when you have to be tolerant to little kids. Well I have to do that sometimes, when I go to visit my little cousin, Sarah. Sarah is eight years old and gets on my nerves. She asks dumb questions and does stupid things and I don't like her at all. My mom says, ""When you grow up, you two will be best friends,"" yeah, right, I don't think so. Whenever I visit her I just have to tolerate her and be patient. For now I have to deal with her, but when we grow up we might become friends, but maybe not, and only time will tell."
1345	19319	7	3	Once when I was patient was when we went to Green Bay and it took forever to get into our hotel, and when it was finally the time we got in the hotel and it was three there time which was which is two our time and I was a little upset. The next day we went to Toy R Us and my sister was mad and my mother wanted to get a van and we tried a white van and me my bro and dad like the white one but my mom and stupid sister didn't like the white Dodge van and we tried the silver van and my mom and dumb stupid sister loved it but me my bro and dad hated it oh and we got the dumb silver van and it took hours to get the dumb van and it was stupid going home. The whole trip required a great deal of patience from everyone involved.
1346	19320	7	3	Patience is the way to being a truly virtuous person. Fundamentally, patience is waiting a while for something, as it requires self-control. If you wait a long time without getting mad or reading out in frustration, you are what people call patient. If you keep up this habit, you will have a good life that is more peaceful and rewarding. Cultivating this quality helps you navigate challenges with a calm and steady mind, leading to greater success and happiness in all your endeavors.
1347	19321	7	3	The first time I learned patience was when I was very young. My mom said she would buy me a PlayStation, and I wanted it so badly. But I had to wait to get it, so I did, and I waited and waited and waited. Then I figured it had been a whole month and still nothing had happened. I was just so mad, but I didn't do anything. So we went to Walmart, and she finally bought me the PlayStation. I was incredibly happy. Later, I asked for an Xbox, a Series Seven. My mom said to wait, so I waited for three months, but still nothing. Four months passed, nothing, and five months, still nothing. I was just so angry, but a whole year passed and I got a new house. It was awesome; I got my own room and a television. I also got an Xbox Series Seven, too. Being older is truly awesome because you learn that good things come to those who wait.
1348	19322	7	3	"Oh, I have a great story about patience! One day, I was at my grandmother's and grandfather's house. There were my two brothers, my little sister, my grandmother, and my grandfather, and myself present. My grandfather was ready to serve up ice cream. All of a sudden, my brothers and sisters started yelling, ""I'm going first, I'm going first!"" My grandfather asked, ""Lathan, what about you?"" I responded by saying, ""I'm not being a part of this!"" I thought to myself, how long is this going to go on? Since this was all suddenly getting me a little freaked out, I said, ""Everyone! Get in line!"" They were like, ""Okay."" So, patiently, everyone got in the line and took their turn choosing what kind of ice cream they wanted. And what a choice we had: vanilla, strawberry, mint, or cookie dough ice cream. Everyone settled down and enjoyed their ice cream cone, showing how a little patience can turn chaos into a pleasant and orderly experience for all."
1349	19323	7	3	I was patient when I was going to the doctor's office to get a check-up. I did not complain about it, even though I had to wait for two hours in the waiting room. Then, when I finally went in, they took a couple of X-rays, which took about another hour. After that, they took some blood tests and other routine examinations. Then, at the very end of the long process, I finally went home. That was the time I was patient, understanding that sometimes you must endure a long wait for necessary things without frustration.
1350	19324	7	3	One time I was going hunting. We got to the woods at five or earlier in the morning. When we got there, we found a spot to sit on the ground. We were going to stay in the woods till dark or until we killed our limit of deer. When it was only half an hour till dark, we saw a doe, but when we moved the gun to shoot it, it ran away. We stayed still, not moving or talking, just waiting patiently. Then more deer came, but they were really small, so we let them go. When there were like fifteen minutes left till dark, a good-sized doe came out. It was too far away, though, so we waited for it to get closer. Then, boom, the rifle goes off. It dropped but was still alive, just laying down. We waited like ten or more minutes, and then it finally died. That was one of the times I was patient, and it ultimately led to a successful hunt.
1351	19326	7	3	There are many ways to be patient, like while you are waiting in the lunch line to get your food or when you line up to leave the room. Here is a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating, and I was talking to some friends. I wanted to go right away, but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate immediately, but they had to tell us all the safety rules first, so I said nothing and listened. Then we walked in to skate, but there was a long line for skates. I did not push or shove my way through; I just waited patiently for my turn. Then I finally got my skates, had a great time skating, ate a snack, and then left. This is how we can be patient.
1352	19327	7	3	Patience, can you be patient? Some people are and some are and some are not. Sometimes I cannot be patient. Well, here is a story about patience. One time at school in the lunch line, it was very long. It would barely move. I wanted lunch so badly that I was not being patient at all. But for some reason, my friend was being very patient. I said to her, why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to get something to eat eventually. I said yeah, that is true. So I tried to be patient like her, and before I knew it, the line had moved and I was sitting by my friends, talking and happily eating my food.
1353	19328	7	3	I was so bored, but I knew it would pay off in the end. I was on a flight to visit my grandparents, and it took many hours. In that time, I found ways to pass the time. I went to the bathroom, I ate the lunch they provided, I played with my mobile phone for a while, and then I slept for a bit. After I woke up, I played a game on my phone again. Finally, the pilot announced we were landing, and we were there at last. It felt good to have been patient during the long journey.
1354	19329	7	3	I was patient in gym class today for my skill test, and I did great, I got a perfect score. We have many students in my class, so it was quite the long wait. Also, when it was my turn, it took about half a minute to do it. We wasted all of the hour on the skill drill, and I was waiting to play dodgeball all hour. It was a bit sad because we didn’t get to play dodgeball at all. So I pretty much wasted my entire hour on the skill test, and it certainly tested my patience. That is the end of my story about waiting.
1355	19330	7	3	I had to be patient when I really wanted a new bike, and I had to make money for it. So I went to the neighbors' houses, picking up leaves for them until I showed them I could also shovel their driveways. Over time, I slowly saved all the money I earned. Finally, I had enough money saved for my new bike. It was hard to be patient and wait while I worked for it, but in the end, it really paid off when I rode my new bike home.
1356	19331	7	3	A day of dreadful patience. “Can we leave now, Dad? I’m so bored,” I complained. I waited for an answer, but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in the cold warehouse, waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. “That’s it, I’m gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don’t touch anything,” Dad said. So I sat here, cold, bored, and hangry, waiting for what seemed like hours. Finally, my dad got back and told me it might be another hour. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while to the nearby food court. After we got some food, we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A forklift driver had somehow managed to get his forklift stuck in the trailer. That’s when my dad had it. He got out and then all we heard was hollers and screams. FINALLY! After my dad yelled a bit, we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that some thing I definitely don’t have is patience.
1357	19332	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I was at my first football game. I wanted to get in but I had to wait in a very long line. I waited an entire hour just to get in. The team was tied in the third quarter, seven to seven, and it was the final play of the game and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player so he put me in. I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball, he fumbled, and I ran for the touchdown. If I wouldn't have been patient, I wouldn't have won the game cause the coach wouldn't have put me in. That was the time I was patient, and it truly paid off in the end.
1358	19333	7	3	One time I was patient is when I went to get my hair cut and she told me to come at two o'clock. But when I got there at two, she had like three people in front of me, but I didn't care because I didn't have to do nothing after. So I was just going to sit there and be patient, and I had my best friend with me so I wasn't bored and we was just sitting there talking and texting our boyfriends. So then the lady that was about to cut my hair came to me and said I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time, and I said oh it's ok, I can wait. And when she got done with their hair, the ladies came to me and said they was sorry. So then she had one person left, and by the time she got done, it was getting on like four-thirty. And that was the time I was being patient, and it all worked out just fine.
1359	19334	7	3	To me, patience is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend, and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patience got me a new hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new one, so I went to the pro shop at the ice arena I was playing at. “Do you have the Bauer Connor McDavid vapor XXX?” I asked, wondering if it would be easy to get it. “Sorry, buddy, we just ran out,” said the salesman, giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick, I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online, I thought to myself. The delivery didn't arrive quickly. It took about three weeks for it to finally arrive. It was worth all the time and effort, proving that good things come to those who wait.
1360	19335	7	3	I have patience until summer vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until summer arrives. For example, last year I was on the honor roll three times. Over the summer, if I have to do book reports or a summer project, then I will do it and I won’t leave it until the last minute. Then, I’ll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I’ll also wait until summer again. But in between we have some breaks and days off, though I think we still have enough assignments throughout the year, since we go to school five days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, for example, I wait for field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so the principal doesn’t take our privileges away; for example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, she’ll take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be for nothing. That really wouldn’t be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble, not me.
1361	19336	7	3	A time when I was patient well it didn’t just happen once it happens all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when I go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just don’t go to one mall and stop they go to at least two malls three max. They also visit a lot of strip malls too, for example stores like Simply Fashion and Rainbow. They are going to a hundred places for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and I'm getting hungry and tired but, I don’t complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like Victoria's Secret, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. Then they shop for jewelry, make up, perfume, and every woman item known to the world. Plus I get lost because they leave me behind in the stores. In conclusion, I am very patient for my mother no matter what she does or how long it takes.
1362	19337	7	3	I’m writing about a time when I was patient. Because I was about to go to a party and I had to be patient but I didn’t manage to stay calm. I had got angry and I just couldn’t be patient. And I also know someone who is patient, but that wasn't me that day. They just couldn’t wait they really couldn’t wait but I waited, waited, waited and I got mad I couldn’t even wait no longer. I was actually was waiting on my aunt to come pick me up and she didn’t show up. I called my mom and she said she was going to take me to the party and I was patient and she didn’t come either. So I didn’t go to the party and I was mad. Because my mama didn't come pick me up, I ended up calling my grandma and she came and picked me up. That was the only time I was patient, but it was a hard lesson in learning to wait.
1363	19338	7	3	You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient on my trip to Pennsylvania last summer. I had to be patient for two hours before me and my family finally arrived at our destination. The next day I had to be more patient because we went to an amusement park. There I had to wait in very long lines for all the popular rides, and it is really hard to be patient when you are excited. Is it hard for you to be patient when you really want to do something? That’s the story of when I had to practice having patience during my vacation.
1364	19339	7	3	It’s about three o’clock the clock tells me, but I can’t go to sleep because my grandfather and I are going fishing. So it’s eight o’clock now my grandfather was suppose to be here at seven, but my grandma kept saying he’ll be here, so I believed her but I was a little worried. Now it’s ten o’clock in the evening by now. I’m just furious I am about to cry, but my grandma said he’ll be here, and I said, “Forget it he won’t come,” and went in my room. Then I realized he will be here he will be here. Then I heard the door open I ran and it was him I ran and said you finally came and we ate then I look outside and seen the boat. That’s a time I should have had more patience and trusted that he would arrive.
1365	19340	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I was at home it was Christmas time. I was the first one up and I just wanted to open all of my presents and gifts but I had to wait till every one got down stairs and for my mom to get the camera ready. Then we opened presents. My brother and sister went first because they are the oldest, a rule my brother made up. Then finally it was my turn I just randomly took the present and ripped the paper off not even looking at the present because it was my turn after waiting so long. I had been patient all this time and that was the time when I was a very patient person on Christmas morning.
1366	19341	7	3	Patience to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my family went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide. The line was incredibly long, with a lot of kids and adults ahead of us, so we waited for what felt like an hour. We finally were second in line, so close to the front. The kids in front of us were very kind and offered to let us get in front of them, but we politely turned them down, deciding it was only fair to wait our turn. So we were waiting patiently while the life guard was giving instructions to a young boy, telling him to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slide. But then something scary happened. The little boy fell off his tube, hit his head on the side, and almost drowned because he didn't know how to swim. The lifeguard acted quickly and pulled him to safety. It was a scary moment for everyone watching, but after everything was okay, we still went down the slide and had a great time for the rest of the day.
1367	19342	7	3	"Clunk! I jolted in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole. ""Look who's awake,"" my mom barked in a voice as annoying as possible. ""You slept for so long I thought you might sleep until school starts back up."" ""Where are we?"" I asked in a dreary voice. ""Ohio,"" replied my mom's friend Sarah. We were going to Florida with my mom, Sarah, and me, my sister Emily, over spring break. We would be staying in the Florida Keys. While we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in the area. I knew it was going to be a memorable trip, but I also knew the long car ride there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us two or three long days to reach our destination. The second day would be the hardest of them all. This was the day we would be driving through the winding mountain roads. I can usually pass the time when I am riding in the car by reading a book or listening to music on my headphones. However, when we reached the peak of the second mountain, everything went completely hectic. First off, my sister (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane frighteningly close to the edges. Second, my sister started grasping my arm like her life depended on it, her nails digging into my skin. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started acting up! All of these things combined to turn our pleasant ride through the mountains into a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself, ""I'm going to go insane! Just make it stop."" As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my sister's grasp on my arm was relieved, and we were pulling into a welcome rest stop with bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountains I would have truly gone insane. I would be sitting in an asylum. I will always remember that harrowing ride through the mountains as a lesson in enduring discomfort."
1368	19343	7	3	"Today was the first day I was truly patient. I couldn’t believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in a long line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said, ""Excuse me, I have to be somewhere in ten minutes. If you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the manager."" All the guy behind the counter said was, ""I’m so sorry but you will just have to wait until everybody that was in line in front of you gets their order before you."" ""Seriously, are you kidding me?"" she yelled as she stomped away, and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I must have looked when I’m impatient. So I waited calmly in line until I got up to the counter and I said, ""Do you have to deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly."" And he said, ""Yeah, there are a lot of people that are like that around here. It's truly sad. So, what would you like to order?"" I told him my order, a double scoop of chocolate, and walked home. As I walked home licking my ice cream, I felt so proud of my calm behavior and decided that I’m never gonna be impatient again in such situations."
1369	19344	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my gymnastics meet to start. I had to wait two long hours along with the rest of my team. We began by warming up and stretching thoroughly, and then we were talking about who we thought would win the team trophy. After a while, we asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour due to a delay. So, we talked some more about our routines and practiced some basic skills for floor exercise on the sidelines. We started a head-stand contest and did as much as we could to make the time go by faster, trying to keep our spirits high. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be a half hour longer because they had to get another judge. Finally, an hour later, the judge arrived and the coaches had their brief meeting and we started the meet. That is a time I was patient, waiting for the competition to begin.
1370	19345	7	3	I’m going to write about when I was patient. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone. She said if I could be patient and wait until my birthday, I would be able to get a phone. So I was patient. I didn’t ask about it every day; I just waited. Time flew by and on my birthday, my family surprised me and she said yes. You see, when I was patient enough to get a cell phone, I got one. Have you ever been patient with your family? Tell me, did it work out or did it go bad? With your family, if you are patient, it probably will work out for you, just like it did for me. And that is what happens when you are patient and wait for good things.
1371	19346	7	3	"""Did it come yet!?"" I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop, my backpack bouncing wildly. She was still standing by the mailbox, holding a thick wad of envelopes, flipping through them slowly. One of these, I hoped with all my heart, was the letter. ""Not yet, honey,"" she said with a sympathetic smile, ""but there’s plenty of bills to go around."" I wanted to scream in exasperation, but I took a deep breath and remembered what my grandma had said, ""just wait long enough and you’ll get what you want."" I trudged inside and plopped down heavily on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It would say which advanced classes I would be in. It doesn’t sound that important, but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get fifty bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of the school year and wait the entire summer for results. Pretty good system, huh? No! Pretty soon, other things distracted me—swim meets, tennis, books—and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. Grandma was right, I guess. One late August afternoon, right in the middle of the summer, I was on the porch reading a novel. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the mail truck. The mailman shuffled around in his bag, pulled out a stack of mail, placed it in our mailbox, and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox, my heart pounding. I surveyed the mail quickly, my fingers flipping past catalogs and flyers, until one official-looking envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read I have been selected for the following advanced classes: Social studies, Mathematics, and English! My patience finally paid off!"
1372	19348	7	3	The time I was patient was the time I was eight years old. It was a snowy night, and my mom and dad were buying a new car. It took so long; I was so hungry. My mom and dad were talking with the car dealer at his desk, discussing numbers and papers. My brother and sister were playing a game on their phone to pass the time. When my mom and dad were finally done talking with the car dealer, they got up to look at the car they wanted. Just then, one of the worker's brought me and my brother and sister a small box of cookies and little cartons of milk while my mom and dad were looking at the interior. We ate them quickly, and soon we got hungry again, but I showed patience and didn't complain. My mom and dad found the car they wanted; they chose a van with a television inside. They paid for it, signed the last of the papers, and we left. When we did, my father took us to a diner to get some food, and I was glad I had waited so calmly.
1373	19349	7	3	I consider myself to be an always patient person, that is, until I have to sit for hours doing nothing; then I can become quite restless. My mom is patient too, she has a great deal of patience, especially at the library where she works. A lot of people can be very rude to her, complaining about late fees or books that are not on the shelf. She just listens calmly and helps them as best she can, never raising her voice. It amazes me how she maintains her composure, and I try to learn from her example in my own daily life.
1374	19350	7	3	One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were waiting in a long, winding line to put our school supplies on the list. We were number one hundred and fifteen, and they had just called number forty-two. It was around ninety percent humidity outside and we had to stand there in the heat. It was so long that the new battery I had just put in my Nintendo DS went completely dead. It took around two and a half hours just to get inside the building. Then, once we were in, there were even more lines to navigate! We barely got our things that day, the store was nearly picked clean, but because we were patient and waited our turn, we did manage to get what we needed.
1375	19351	7	3	I didn’t know where we were at; I had never been to this part of town before. Then my dad told me we were at this place called Buddies. I’d never been there until that day. The waitress put us at a circular table near the window. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a Diet Pepsi. My sister got a fruit punch, as always. My mom and dad both got a Mountain Dew. My brother got a cherry Pepsi. I don’t know why we all got different drinks. It took fifteen long minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasn’t so patient; he kept sighing and looking toward the kitchen. He knew that the food would take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks on a large tray. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for our food after ordering was another twenty minutes. My dad was very impatient, tapping his fingers on the table. I was the only patient one at our table, trying to keep everyone calm. The restaurant wasn’t even that busy, which made the wait feel longer. I told my dad to just be patient, that the food will be right out any minute. So we waited and waited, making small talk. Finally, the food came out, steaming hot. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient when everyone else was not.
1376	19352	7	3	I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my tenth birthday party. I was so excited and jumpy. I was turning ten so it was a big deal for me. We all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running on it and “Happy Birthday Hannah.” The party started at eleven am. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I kept asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldn’t wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it the door bell rang and all my family came running in with presents and cards. I guess all that waiting really payed off. I also got some really cool presents, and I learned that being patient makes the final surprise even sweeter.
1377	19353	7	3	Everyday at school I have to be patient to get my food like pizza, salad, sandwich with milk which is bad all the time but I check my milk. I had to be patient to get my gum to chew after lunch. The line in the cafeteria is always very long and moves slowly. I stand there waiting my turn, watching the clock tick away. Sometimes my friends are ahead of me and they get their food first. I just have to wait quietly without pushing or complaining. Finally, when I get to the front, I can choose my food and my milk. Then I can go sit down and enjoy my meal with everyone else. Learning to wait my turn is an important part of having patience every single day.
1378	19354	7	3	"Elkhorn Jr. High school, October 15th, Colton Thornbourne was having a pretty bland day, he absolutely hated school, he just wanted to go home, but his teacher told him to sit down, shut up, and do his work. So he tries to kill time by flicking eraser tops at the chalkboard. After about sixty eraser tops, he looks at the clock and it reads, 1:30. He complains to his teacher and she says, ""Colton, if you don't be patient I'm going to send you home!"" Colton exclaims, ""But I want to go home!"" The teacher says, ""That's it Colton, to detention after school."" So Colton sits down in fear of detention and does his work, all day, without complaining. ""Finally,"" the teacher says when the bell rings, signaling the end of the school day and his long period of forced patience."
1379	19355	7	3	I was waiting, looking forward and staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend Sarah. On the other side of the stage was our competitors Mark and Johnson. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while Mrs. Perkins kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pairs and write a story about anything we wanted. Sarah and I looked at each other and shook our heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to Sarah’s house and thought about what to write. Mrs. Perkins also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited, almost jumping up and down, because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to Sarah, already shouting out ideas. Finally we decided on something to write about. It would be an adventure story about how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. By the end of the week we had ten pages written down. I went on my Acer and typed the ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day; it was a tie between Johnson and Mark and Sarah and me. So our writing was given to the state for another competition. Ironically, Mark’s pair and my pair won again! I really hoped we wouldn't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage, still staring at the audience, all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. Sarah told me to have some patience so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the president came up and said Hannah and Sarah have won first place. We jumped up and down and got our trophy. Sarah and I found out that hard work and patience can really lead to something great, a lesson I will always remember.
1380	19356	7	3	One Monday I was patient waiting for a game to arrive. I waited two years for it to come and the game finale came. I started out the Monday like it was any other. But the Monday just kept dragging on so by the time I got home I just sat on the front porch the rest of the Monday waiting for it. It never came so I just went to bed. The next Tuesday I came home and checked the mail but it was empty so I slumped onto the couch and watched TV. I looked out the front window and there was a package that was just delivered. It was my game and that's the story of my patience, which finally resulted in getting the game I had wanted for so long.
1381	19357	7	3	Once I was at a Red Wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boring, with the line barely moving at times. There were a lot of people in line that game, all eager to get inside. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didn’t because that would be rude and unfair to everyone else who had been waiting. I felt that helped me develop my patience a little bit more, learning to stand there quietly. Plus I would not want people cutting in front of me in line, so I treated others the way I wanted to be treated. I learned that good things come to people who wait, and eventually, I got my tickets and enjoyed the game.
1382	19358	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I remember watching the clock and listening for her car, trying to keep myself occupied. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want, because getting upset only makes the time feel longer. In the end, my grandma arrived and we had a great day, which showed me the value of waiting calmly.
1383	19359	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. Maybe waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patient to get my first dog. It was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldn’t find the right one at first. It took several weeks til we saw the cutest Chihuahua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him. When we turned them in the lady said we had a background check too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog supplies while they told us we could pick him up on Saturday. We were so excited. Instead of Saturday we thought we could pick him up on Friday. On that Friday we picked him up. It took two years of patience for my sister and only one year for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog. We didn’t find one, but we waited and if you're patient you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow it, understanding that the right things happen in their own time.
1384	19360	7	3	I am patient at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher or someone else is busy I will wait for however long I need to, until they are alone helping someone else. In any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because I had to finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remember from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help, she went to help them. So I waited, it took about the whole hour but, I waited and was patient with them. At the end of the hour they still weren't done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said I’d see them the next day. The next day in art Sarah helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. Sarah was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my box. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one, and it taught me that patience often leads to getting the help you need.
1385	19361	7	3	I can’t really tell you about a time when I’ve been patient because that something I struggle with; no matter how hard I try to be patient it just seems to be impossible but it’s not, maybe. I just don’t try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatient I am is I’m at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I won’t save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candies instead for immediate satisfaction. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can’t spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because I don’t want to wait until they give it back; most the time that happens. I get grounded but the item is worth it to me because I get candy right away. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom says no I always sneak it and get in trouble, showing how my impatience leads to consequences. I recognize this is a challenge for me.
1386	19362	7	3	Patience is being able to wait for something without getting overly upset or frustrated. For some, patience is a difficult virtue to master, while for others, it comes more easily. For me, I would say I'm just okay at being patient. Like I'm being patient for this new game I pre-ordered, which I am very excited to play. It comes out @DATE1, and I think about it often, but I can manage the wait. When I'm not patient is when I want to get on the computer and my brother is using it; I get very antsy and keep asking when it will be my turn. I was also patient for getting my second class rank in my martial arts class, which felt like a long time coming. Well, that's all I have to say about patience, and how it can be a challenge sometimes.
1387	19363	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to go and get my shots. It was just me and my dad who went together. I had to get my shots because I was sick with something that required immunization. It was still cold outside because it was in @DATE1, and I remember seeing my breath in the air. We went to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children, which was a special clinic. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go, feeling a bit nervous. I put on an orange turtle neck sweater and jeans with my favorite sneakers. I didn’t want to go because it was right after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games I was eager to play with instead. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive, and the car ride was quiet. My dad filled out the information forms at the front desk, and then we sat in the waiting area. In the middle, we started to watch the television mounted on the wall. I was really bored because there was nothing on but infomercials about cleaning products and weird gadgets. They had us waiting for over an hour, which felt like an eternity. I started to get hungry and very upset, fidgeting in my chair. They finally called our name, and I felt a mix of relief and new fear. In the end, it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a small cup of juice to help me feel better. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots, which made my heart sink. I got my shots, which took a very long time because I was so tense and frustrated. After I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots in a few weeks. I was still hungry so we got food from @CAPS2.Donalds on the way home. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots, even though it was hard. The information we had to wait for was just as painful as getting my shots in its own way. They had us wait for a very long time, testing my ability to stay calm. I was sad to have to wait but happy it was finally over for that day.
1388	19364	7	3	I have experienced patience when I went on a long trip to @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour strip, and we were all packed into a small car. We were a little cranky and caradable because we didn’t sleep very well the night before, even though I had brought a book & my @ORGANIZATION1 game to pass the time; we were still pretty bored. All I did was watch trees and fields roll by after my battery died on my @ORGANIZATION1 device. Dad was concentrated on the road, focusing on driving, and mom finally started counting license plates to see where other travelers were from. Once he got into @LOCATION2, the scenery changed a bit, and I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her nap and was explaining the whole dream she had. So I started reading my book again to distract myself. Even though you could hear mom, @CAPS1 talking, and my stomach growling loudly, we didn’t stop for a break. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotel's front desk shut down for the night. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1, watching the mile markers, to then arrive at @TIME1 at the hotel. We were so excited and exhausted that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes of getting into the bed, our patience finally rewarded with rest.
1389	19366	7	3	Being patient, what does it truly mean? It means that “you are understanding and tolerant, especially during a long delay. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, I must admit that being a patient person is often difficult. One time, it was particularly hard for me to be a patient person, though I didn’t complain aloud. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park to celebrate my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on immediately, but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away, which felt like forever. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would ultimately make my experience even better when it arrived. I was tolerant, understanding, and forced myself to be patient. The week dragged on slowly, each day feeling longer than the last. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower than usual, but I knew that I couldn’t give in to that feeling! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem became very clear. I realized that if I didn’t think about it constantly, time would fly by again as it normally does. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone around me with my constant complaints about the wait. When the day finally came, I had a blast, just as I had hoped. Being patient always turns out good in the end, making the reward feel even sweeter.
1390	19368	7	3	"Being Patient. Being patient has its good and bad sides, like most things in life. I have had good things happen to me when I @CAPS1 the only thing I had to do was be patient. Here are some good things that happened to me because I waited. A time when I was patient was when I tried out for the dance team at my dance studio. I was so nervous, as I had never tried out for anything before. I had to wait & wait & wait for what felt like ages for my dance studio to call my mom with the results. One day when I was at a friend's house my mom called me and said ""@CAPS2, you have made the dance team."" I was so happy and relieved that all my waiting had paid off. I couldn't wait to learn a new dance and practice with the team. Then I could saw everyone at my dance competitions and perform for a crowd. It will be so much fun and a great experience. Another time I was patient was when I broke my arm. I had to be really patient during the healing process. I had to be so careful of my arm and not use it for many things. I had it in a cast for several weeks, and then I waited to get it off, counting down the days. Now I have no cast on, and my arm is back to normal. I was so patient that the doctor said that it was healing perfectly & I didn't need a cast any more, which was wonderful news. If you are patient, better things will come to you in time, just as they did for me."
1391	19369	7	3	Once I went to Disney World and we were waiting for about two hours to get on this stupid ride. I was okay because I had my Nintendo DS, so I played that, but after an hour I got bored. I picked on my sisters and it was fun watching them get mad. Then I got bored with that too, so I just sat down on the hot pavement of the road, feeling the sun on my back until the line finally moved.
1392	19371	7	3	In my own words, patience is when you have to just be calm and quiet, and not all hyper and annoying. Patience is just about controlling yourself and your impulses, and not being all rude and disrespectful to others who might be causing the delay. It is a quiet strength you find inside when you have to wait for something you really want.
1393	19372	7	3	One day when I was at my sister's football game, my mom dropped us off because she had to go to work. When I got out of the car she asked me if I had my money with me. I said no, then she said you're just going to be hungry. I said okay. Later, when the game started, I got really hungry. Suddenly, I checked all of my pockets, and it just so happened that I found five bucks. Immediately, I went to see how long the concession line was. The line was so long it was almost stretching out to the street. Hoping for the best, I sat back down, trying to let the line get shorter. But the line had gotten way longer, so I ran and got in the line. I had to stand in it for about twenty minutes. After I finally got out of the line, I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. Then she came up to us and asked me to buy her some french fries. I said no because the line was too long. But she said please! Reluctantly, I went back in line and it moved way slower this time. When I got back she said, what took you so long. I said just look at the line. That is one of the times I was patient, even though it was really difficult.
1394	19373	7	3	I think patience is like when somebody is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom so then the other person can finally go in. Like I am not very patient because I want to go to a store right now, but they said to wait for my turn. My whole family is not very good at being patient, but interestingly, my friends are usually more patient than we are when we have to wait for things together.
1395	19374	7	3	"A time when I was patient was on the long car ride to the beach. It was a four-hour car ride but I stayed patient; I didn’t complain at all. Most kids would keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" but I didn’t say a word. Also, when I was super hungry, I just sat there quietly and did not complain or bother anyone. Finally, after what felt like forever, we got there. That is a time I was truly patient throughout the entire journey."
1396	19375	7	3	One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet express, which was an exciting prospect. So we had to wait in this big line that snaked along the dock. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late, and a cool breeze began to pick up. I should have known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing, making the wait quite uncomfortable. We were the first people in line so that was a good thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything as we watched the water. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining during the long, cold delay. That day turned out to be very nice and fun once we were finally on our way.
1397	19376	7	3	When my friend was getting his meds I waited until he got ready, I was seating to wait for him on a nearby bench. I was getting my phone down loud to play @PERSON2 ping pong and uplift, trying to pass the time. I was looking around for @PERSON1, wondering where he was, and I was waiting for him to be done with his errand. The waiting area was quiet, and I just focused on my game until everything was finished.
1398	19377	7	3	One @DATE1 day, my uncle took me to @CAPS1 point to go on a roller @CAPS2, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The line was so long, weaving back and forth, we waited at least @NUM1 hours under the bright sun. Time went by slowly as we shuffled forward with the crowd, and we finally got on the ride, which was over in a thrilling minute. After the exciting ride, we went to the @CAPS5 thrill @CAPS6, which took about an hour and a half to get through, making for a long but fun day at the park.
1399	19378	7	3	"Patience. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS4 stomach rumbled."" @CAPS2 I'm hungry"" I cried so @CAPS12 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2, because @CAPS8 were on our way home from a long trip. Moments later @CAPS8 finally pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2's drive through, the car tires crunching on the gravel. The cashier said ""hi @MONTH1 I take your @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 yelled ""@CAPS5 I get a famous bowl and a @NUM1 piece honey @CAPS6 wings."" The ladie @CAPS7 ""@MONEY2 @NUM2 first window."" @CAPS8 drove around to the first window where @CAPS4 @CAPS2 save the ladie a @MONEY1 bill, @CAPS12 gave her @MONEY3 and said ""@MONEY3 is your change, go to the second window."" @CAPS9 @CAPS8 could drive to the second window @CAPS8 had to wait on the car ahead of us, which was taking a long time. @CAPS8 sat there for @MONEY1 minutes and they finally left, their brake lights disappearing. Then, @CAPS8 drove to the second window and waited, the smell of food making the wait harder. @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 still was waiting, the car idling quietly. So after @MONEY1 minutes. I said"" @CAPS2 @CAPS5 @CAPS8 go get some @ORGANIZATION1"" @CAPS12 calmly @CAPS7 ""@CAPS10, @CAPS8 are going to sit here patiencely."" I mumerred ""but I m starving."" @CAPS8 sat there and waited patientley for over a hour, the radio playing softly. I ask one more time ""@CAPS5 @CAPS8 leave please."" @CAPS12 said ""@CAPS10, I payed for the food and I'm going to get it."" @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 finally got the food after two hours, the bags handed through the window. After sitting there for so long, @CAPS8 got some free food as an apology for the delay. Even though @CAPS8 got some free food I well still mad that @CAPS8 sat there all that time, feeling the frustration of the long, hungry wait."
1400	19379	7	3	It was a hot sizzling @DATE1 day I had descidid to ride my dirt bike @CAPS1 I but on my helmet, boots, goggles, and gloves, feeling the heat immediately. I headed out the door and out to my dirt bike, started it with a roar and took off across the field. Like a speeding bulit ìzoomî I went up one of the ramp and I landid but I was going to fast around a corner and ìwamî I fell off and the foot deg went into my leg, sending a sharp pain through me. My dad came running picked me up and put me in the truck to go to the @CAPS2, driving quickly. When we arrived my dad had to check in at the front desk after that we sat down in the crowded waiting room. There was a lot of people there men women kids and babys, all waiting their turn. An hour passed and we were still siting there, then two more hours dragged by then finily they called my name. the nurse took my dad and I to a small room and said ìthe doctor will be in shortley.î ìall rightî my dad replide with a sigh. An hour passed no doctor, the silence becoming heavy. We were starting to get bord @CAPS1 my dad turned on the tv to a news channel. Then finily to three hours after we got in the room the doctor came in by now it was @NUM1 pm and we were exostid from the long day. The doctor took me to get xrayed when we got back the doctor said I had brused my bone and gave me crushes and said to stay off of it for a week to heal properly. When we got home I laxed on the couch and went right to sleep, completely worn out. That was the time when I was patient for six hours in the @CAPS2, a long and trying experience.
1401	19380	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game I played for the destroyerís. So in all the gameís I always had to wait to the second half. So in the first game of the season I got in four times. In the first half I got in for about one minute. Then I got in for two minutes in the first half. I was happy but I still wasnít starting. Then we got into the play offís I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teamateís came up to me and said donít worry your gonna your time to start everyone will. Over the next few monthís I waited patiently, practicing hard at every opportunity. Then we got in tournamentís then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoffís then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient, learning that good things come to those who wait and work hard.
1402	19381	7	3	"Patience helps you get through life. If you aren't patient then you won't know where to go next in the future. My uncle had to be patient for a month. He was running amok just waiting for a phone call. Finally someone yelled just be patient they will call. He admitted that being patient is the hardest thing he had to do. He was confused why they couldn't call the next day. He said he ended up forgetting about it here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as he could be. My uncle was waiting for a callback about America's next top model. They told him they would call if he got in. They soon did because the phone rang. A woman nicely said ""May I speak with John Sanders please"" My uncle replied ""yes this is him! I have been waiting for a month! My family kept telling me to be patient! So now I don't have to wait anymore!"" ""You are in! so keep on practicing! Someone else will call you with the details!"" ""Thank you so much!"" then he hung up the phone ""I'm in!"" That was the happiest day of our lives. My uncle went through a lot. Really all that kept him grounded was him being patient. He told us it was hard but it worked out great in the end. Here's future advice. Always and I mean always be patient. You're not going to get anywhere in your life if you aren't. Patience is an important part of your life."
1403	19382	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting a bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. The coins were spread all over the table, and I had to sort them into neat piles before I could even begin. I still remember the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and I couldn’t think I could make it because I admit to be a very impatient person. My fingers were sore, but I felt a real sense of achievement. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue,” and I learned that day just how true that is.
1404	19383	7	3	Sitting in the car waiting for my mom to get out of the house and into the car. When she got in the car we were off. On the way to the city for the birthday party I got pretty bored after about a couple minutes. When we got out of Midland I thought it would go by pretty fast but I was wrong it was slower than ever. I was bored out of my mind and the thing that made it worse was that my little sisters were screaming in the back. So then we stopped at a gas station which felt like forever. I pretty much never talked the whole way up there I was trying to be patient but I couldn’t take it. I managed to calm myself down after about an hour of the girls screaming. They finally fell asleep. I just sat there looking out the window when we were about forty-five minutes away it felt like we have been driving for days. It was probably like five minutes away when the girls finally woke up. They started screaming “Are we there yet?” My mom and dad just kept saying “soon.” When we pulled into the driveway it was probably the happiest thing that happened that day. I thought I was pretty patient on the way up there but on the way back I might just sleep. At the party I was patient until we could open the presents. I freaked out with excitement. I hope next time none of that will happen, but I learned a little about enduring a long trip.
1405	19384	7	3	Being patient is hard to be. First of all it's like you're waiting in a line that could take forever. Being patient at this line could take a long time but it could go by fast if you had something to do. You could bring a book to read and read all the way up to the front of the line. You could also just be patient and watch the people around you, noticing the small details you usually miss. It is a challenge to just stand there and wait without getting frustrated or annoyed. The key is to find a way to occupy your mind so the time seems to pass more quickly. Learning to be patient is a valuable skill that can help you in many difficult situations throughout your life.
1406	19385	7	3	One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called Disneyland point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I’m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at Disneyland point like on the way there in the car, getting a campsite for a picnic, and also in lines for the popular attractions. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient, making the wait feel unimportant.
1407	19386	7	3	I remember the time when I went to the amusement park and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the amusement park I was so excited because it was my first time going to the amusement park. It was so colorful and loud, filled with the sounds of laughter and ride machinery. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angel, quietly and without fidgeting. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a long long time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and bam! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the popcorn and lemonade stand and did the same exact thing, waiting calmly once more! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!
1408	19387	7	3	I know a time when I was patient. My friend John was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant touchdown. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got their, and I just waited on the bleachers. When he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do, never rushing or complaining. AS the day progressed the sun was like a tanning booth, beating down intensely. The grass was also as dry as cactus, but the day moved on slowly. Finally when we went are own way, we felt a sense of accomplishment. We knew we had patience, and that made the day a success.
1409	19388	7	3	One time when I was patient my friend Sarah went to the mall around ten am. We were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When we got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirpping, and it was as hot as a summer day. When we both walked hardly anybody was there but we went to a store called The Cool Zone, it was so full of people I thought I was at a concert. We had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So we both waited and waited, chatting to pass the time. Finally we were at the front of the line and the casher said “Wow, you have waited in the long line probably for about one hour. I will give you guys a twenty percent discount.” We went shopping and we got rewarded for being patient, which made the whole experience worthwhile.
1410	19389	7	3	A time that I was patience was last summer when I went to Six Flags point. I was about to get in line to ride the Goliath roller coaster. I was at the begging at the line and then I saw a sign that said two hour wait from that point. But I wasn’t that close to the sign so for me and my family and the other people that were in the same spot as us we must likely have to wait at lest two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day out and I was wearing black which probably wasn’t the smartest choice. So I was waiting in line for about an hour only I just couldn’t take standing in that hot wheather anymore but I really wanted to ride that ride so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patent then I was about five minutes away from the ride and then the line just seemed like people left for me that was good cause then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a time that I was patient and it paid off with a thrilling ride.
1411	19390	7	3	One day in the clinic, I had to sit for two hours because I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there were a lot of people, so we had to stay there a very long time, cause there were only two doctors and this one lady took so long with her appointment. So when it was finally my turn to go in, I was scared that if it would hurt, but then the doctor was doing it and it didn’t hurt for nothing. He was very quick and gentle, and before I knew it, the procedure was over. And then I went home feeling relieved that my worry had been for nothing.
1412	19391	7	3	Awhile back, my best friend Sarah’s grandpa died. They weren’t blood related but they were really close, and he meant the world to her. At the funeral, I saw Sarah, and her sister Emma force a weak smile toward us as we approached. Emma soon left to go talk to my parents, who were standing a little ways off. Then, Sarah started crying, confessing that she wouldn’t see her grandpa’s gravestone, because they were moving soon to Florida. She abruptly changed subjects, beginning to reminisce about the good times she had with her grandpa, like the fishing trips and the stories he told. I laughed and smiled with Sarah, sharing in her fond memories. My parents later said we had to go to church for the service. I hugged her tightly and told her everything would be alright. She managed a small smile and said, “many contrary.” Her eyes filled with fresh tears as she whispered, “I don’t want to move to Florida.” Two weeks later, she did move with her family, and I missed her very much.
1413	19392	7	3	My way of saying your patient is this: your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience. One time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play a game, but I didn`t get to play until the fourth quarter with only two minutes to go, but you know what I did? I had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming, pushing to the front. Like popstars; a lot of singers, popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich, but it they wern`t rich they would wait. Pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient like everyone else. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient; perhaps when they were little they never act like that, so they should remember those lessons now.
1414	19393	7	3	I was patient when my mom go to the store. She will go in the store and get a shopping basket, and she will take a whole day in that store, looking at every single item on the shelves. I will wait outside or sometimes follow her quietly, trying not to complain. In she will come out of that store with a basket fill up to the top, and I will be patient the entire time. Then she will go to a new store and do it all over again, and I would just have to find more patience inside myself to get through the long, slow day of errands without a single word of complaint.
1415	19394	7	3	Once, when my family went to the amusement park, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log boat, then you sit and it takes you slowly up a big hill. You wait until you get to the very top, then you splash down a steep hill into the water below. Well, that was one of everyone's favorite rides, so there was a long, winding line that hardly seemed to move. We had to wait for a half hour just to ride it one single time, shuffling forward step by step. So, in order to do something fun, it often takes time so you must be patient and wait your turn. If your not patient you probably won't get to do what you wanted to do, as you might give up and leave the line too soon.
1416	19395	7	3	"Patience is the ability to be tolerant, understanding, and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isn’t something they teach you in my school. There isn’t a book you're assigned to read called ""Patience 101,"" there is no movie called ""Patience is the Key."" None of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it’s not at all what I had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold, metal bench next to the strength meter at a dusty county fair. What people really don’t understand is the immense patience that is put into being a spy. Sure, there's an occasional car being blown up, but not today, not for me. I hear the clock in my hand go ‘tick, tock, tick, tock.’ ACCESS DENIED, LOADING, there’s some action. The subject, the person I’m assigned to watch, is on the move and, oh, never mind, all the subject has done is buy a three-dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodle a spiraling design in the dirt with the toe of my shoe. I’m just about to abort the mission, seeing that nothing is happening, when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me, I see a tiny, glinting computer chip. I carefully pick it up and spray it with a fingerprint-revealing mist. A purple, fluffy cloud of vapor surrounds the chip. Sure enough, when the purple cloud vanishes, I see that the subject's fingerprints are clearly on the chip. I pull out my laptop and insert the computer chip. LOADING, LOADING are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting, bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I’m able to defeat twelve armed robbers with nothing but a tablecloth, I’m sure I can sit here and just be patient. At least twenty minutes have gone by now, but it feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, LOADING, LOADING, LOADING, and then it was successful. “SUCCESS!” I say aloud and people start to stare, but I don’t mind. I click the square on the screen that says “open.” A small message opens up that says “MEET me at the ice cream parlor.” I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone and everything around me. A man wearing a wrinkled yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf draped over her head are the only two people standing by the ice cream stand. I walk a little bit closer and I realize that the man has a gun tucked into his waistband. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcuffs; of course, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to successfully complete my mission without being patient."
1417	19396	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I wasn’t waiting a second; I was waiting for what felt like hours in that small, white room. My mom couldn’t wait any longer; she was about to take me home, her foot tapping impatiently on the tiled floor. I told her to be patient and it would feel like time is going faster. She said she was going to try, but if it didn’t work we were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle, then he came back in the room a final time and said he found it. It was in the other doctor's room above the sink on the dresser. After I got my shot, the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. After he thanked me, he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat, and I felt proud of our patience.
1418	19397	7	3	So you want a story about being patient, well you're in luck. The story starts off with me at the doctor’s office, so I’m waiting. I was going to sit here for a few hours, so I thought I’d read something. So I’m reading and all I hear is whining and oh, screaming, so I put my book down, not mad. I managed to get the kid to stop crying and the mom to stop screaming, so I was happy. Then my sister Cheris comes up and screams in my ear; I was really annoyed but not mad, so I just got another magazine to read. Then my mom says it’ll be another hour. I was so mad I screamed. This is a true story, and I was pretty patient through it all, even when it was difficult.
1419	19398	7	3	I was patient when we were going to lunch and I was standing there patiently, and we got our lunch. My friend was patient then when we got our lunch. I know a time when my friend was patient too, when we were at the water fountain to get some water and some girls came up to the water fountain to get some water. He waited patiently in line for his turn without pushing or complaining, which showed me how calm he could be.
1420	19400	7	3	Without patience a person can be very easily broken. Without patience a person can be easily triggered to do something horrible; like myself, I have patience, but at a certain point I sometimes don’t have patience. Without patience the whole world would be out of control, which is why most plans of business try to train their employees to be patient as soon as possible. A lack of patience can lead to rushed decisions and unnecessary conflicts, so that is what all this was about: the vital importance of patience in keeping ourselves and our world together.
1421	19401	7	3	When I was patient I remember writing an article at Sea World when I was very little. I didn’t complain because I knew I would get those sometimes, my sister was complaining being she was in a bad mood. We stood in line for forty-five minutes for a ride called the Manta Drop, or something like that I can’t remember. Then there was a line at the platform for the next loading group. We waited twenty minutes plus the time for everyone to get out and settled. It was a long afternoon, but I remained calm throughout the entire wait, which felt like a real accomplishment for someone my age.
1422	19402	7	3	One time I had to be so patient for a plane to come in. We were up at the crack of dawn and had to wait for two to three hours. Over winter break a few years ago me and my family went to Florida. We did lots of things while we were there. When we had to go home we had to wait for a plane. We got up an hour early so we could pack up and get to the airport. When we got there we had to be patient while we returned the rental car and go through security. When we got through security we had to wait for the plane to arrive. We sat for over an hour before the plane came in. When the plane arrived we had to wait for the plane to be cleaned, passes checked, and everyone was on board. That was the time I had to be patient. And I was patient for a very long time to finally get on our way back home.
1423	19403	7	3	A while ago when I went on a trip to Cedar Point in Ohio, it was an hour and thirty minute drive to go there, the reason why we went was because of my dad work conference party. I kept out of the car with my mom, waiting for my cousin’s family, waiting was all I did until the gates were burst out running into the park. My dad points out the height limits (I was only nine and 4.2 ft tall so I wasn’t tall enough for most of the major rides), my dad saw that I was tall enough for the Woodstock Express. We walk around looking for the ride and more importantly the line. So we finally found the ride my attention was drawn from the ride to the line, my mouth practically hit the ground with the expression “good luck getting to the that ride”, my father looked at me than my sister “where is mom and Will?” I pointed over by the Ferris wheel being coward of course. So we just get in the line and sign, it was at least ninety something degrees. we waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front, we got into the chair and a bar came over us, I remember one thing set a quarter on your leg and gravity takes a hold of it . A minute later we are going down like a meteor the quarter doesn’t float away! At that split second were on solid ground now the ride was not really worth the wait, but hey I’m not a coward, and I proved that to myself.
1424	19404	7	3	Over the summer me and my sister were going to go to the Great Wolf Lodge with one cousin Grace and one uncle Reggie. But then he had to reschedule because his plane was going to be late. Then he had to reschedule again because his car broke down. Then we rented a car. Then we had to pick up my uncle Michael and we went on one way. On one way than we got stopped by a cop and the cop gave us a ticket for speeding. We finally arrived and it was the best two days of my life, filled with water slides and fun, making all the earlier troubles feel completely worth it.
1425	19405	7	3	The story I’m about to tell you is about patience where a boy and his father went fishing and the boy is not patient. One day a boy and his dad went fishing when they got there they put the boat in the water and started their trip the boy was impatient and kept constantly knocking. Unfortunately he caught nothing when he got home he said his dad came over and said “son if you caught something every time you fished it would be killing not fishing.” So they went out the next day and since the boy was patient he caught a left muskie because he was patient. Well see what happened with the boy he caught a fish finally because of patience remember “all good things come to those who are patient!”
1426	19406	7	3	My mom was in the hospital! She was getting a life-threatening surgery. This is a story of a time I was patient. My mom didn’t feel good for two years, and when she went to the doctors for a “check-up,” it turned out she had heart disease with a main artery blockage. So I had to wait while she was getting “prepped.” It took two hours, which felt like forever. Then I got to see her for just five minutes before she had to be taken to the surgery room. The surgery itself took five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school, where I did my homework and read magazines. I was very worried about my mom the entire time. But then the doctor came in and said no one could see her for a whole day. I had to be patient and wait until the next day. That was the time I had patience, and in the end, it paid off when I finally got to see her recovering.
1427	19408	7	3	There was a boy that wanted to go to the gym, and when he got there he had to change. There was a certain basketball he wanted to play with. As he was getting dressed, other boys got out there first and took the ball. Later, when he got outside, he saw they had it. He got mad and went over and took it from them. After the incident, he thought about it and then came back and gave it to them, saying, “I can wait.” So when they were done, he got the ball and was so happy and proud that he had finally gotten it. When he got home he told his mom, and she said that she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked, “What is that?” His mom said, “It is a thing when you understand and are tolerant.” The boy was very happy because he always used to take things, and now he could wait to use something and still be happy. That boy now lives happily with his mom in high school, patiently moving along toward the end of his story.
1428	19409	7	3	A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the test before a lot of people and was drawing for the next twenty minutes. I was patient throughout this time because if I wasn't, I might have been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw, or color as some might say, because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checkerboard. It took the entire time, and I am still not done with it. I remained quiet and focused on my coloring until the period was over. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient and managed my time well.
1429	19410	7	3	One time I was patient was at the doctor's office. When I was little and at the doctor, I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me, so she sat with me wherever I went. Mind you, there were girls around, so I got embarrassed and asked mom why are you following me, and she replied because I don’t want you running everywhere. That’s when I told her, “Mom, I’m older now, I’m not five years old, I’m mature now.” She said I could go ahead, so I went over, sat next to some girls, and talked to them. That’s when we got up and started walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying your mom is still following you, so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down; we ate and everything, and I so happened to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Then we went back on the elevator to our original place and sat down, and to my surprise she was already there. That’s when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said, “Were you following me?” and she replied, “Yes, I mean no.” So I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough, it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story about learning to be patient with my mom.
1430	19411	7	3	One time I was patient was when my brother was riding the bike. He was riding by quickly, and I had to wait and wait for my brother to be done. But he said I couldn't ride it yet. I told him that I was being patient, so I waited and waited. He had been riding it for hours. Finally, he had run it out of gear and said, “Now you can ride it.” I replied, “That’s cool,” and then I finally got my turn to ride the bike after waiting so long.
1431	19412	7	3	Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. It also describes a person who experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could officially become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasnít even breaking a sweat, showing no signs of labor at all. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags, which she had packed the night before, and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom finally went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine long days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother, the minutes ticking by slowly, until the nurse finally came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sistersí face I almost started to cry with joy. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.
1432	19413	7	3	"I am in the @LOCATION3 @CAPS1 sea cadet corps. When I packed my things in the truck I had to wait in a @NUM1 hour car ride till I got to my training in port @LOCATION2. We were driving in a truck that fit five people but we were fitting @NUM2 people in it, so I was the one stuck in the back with all the gear. Someone's sea bag had a boat in it that was stabbing me in the back. I tried so hard not to complain about it, and it took all my patience to last half the way there until I finally had to move the boot from my back. I grabbed the bag that had the boot in it and moved it to the other side. When I thought all was well, @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started singing a very annoying song. I didnít think my patience could handle staying in that truck with their singing. Finally we arrived at port @LOCATION2. @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 stopped singing and my patience had held through. But then there was the wait in line; there were @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 ahead of me waiting to check in. Iíd had a feeling my patience was gonna blow up and Iíd go crazy. But it didn't; I stayed there patiently until it was my turn to check in. Sadly, the officer at the check in desk was old and talked very slowly, and it was so hard understanding what he was saying. I finally was checked in and my patience had survived!! Then I found out my friend logon was bunked up with me, which was a concern because he can be very annoying. ""Oh boy,"" I thought, ""here comes another test for my patience."" My patience was tested through the car ride, the check in line, and also through that whole training. But my patience was very strong and it survived the entire experience."
1433	19414	7	3	"@CAPS3 was about a @NUM1 hour drive to freedom hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mum, @CAPS1 and I were going to see buddy guy and @CAPS3 was going to be a @NUM1 and a half hour concert. As we pulled in the parking lot, the policeman guard pointed to the open parking spot for the jeep and we drove into @CAPS3. We got out and drank pop and ate sandwiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After @NUM3 minutes, or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped. I waited and waited until I thought about @NUM5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but @CAPS2 never did. After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked ""how long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?"" ""About five minutes,"" @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought, so I tried again. ""How long?"" ""Six now."" @CAPS3 wouldn't have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise and excitement. Minute after minute rolled by and someone finally stepped on stage. ""The performance will start in @NUM7 minutes,"" @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking news. The wait was only half over. Finally after @NUM7 minutes of dying and waiting, @CAPS2 walked on stage. @CAPS3 was the best sight in the world. @CAPS3 was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed @CAPS3 even more. We packed out for the rest of the night, the music ringing in our ears."
1434	19415	7	3	A time when I am patient is at gymnastics. There are multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics. Your mind, and body have to be patient, and sometimes you have to be patient with the coach. Your mind has to be patient when you wish you could do things but you really can't yet. Your body has to be patient when it feels like you're ready to do a skill but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient, to wait until you are truly prepared. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping other gymnasts. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes, watching others take their turns, until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have, both in the gym and beyond.
1435	19416	7	3	When I was at universal studios and I was waiting in the long lines to get on the rides I was patient. It did take a while but I never got mad or impatient. My dad and I were in a line for this dragon rollercoaster and we were so close to being next when it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left the line in frustration, so we ended up being pushed to the front of the line. We waited for another hour or two, hoping the weather would clear, but it never stopped. We then remembered my mom and brothers were waiting for us, so we decided to leave. I was patient the whole time, despite the disappointment. Later, we went and got in line for one of the new rides they just got, and since it was new the line was very long. We waited for quite a while, inching forward slowly. We eventually got on the ride and we realized the wait was worth it because it was so much fun, so we went again right after.
1436	19417	7	3	"When I was @NUM1 years old, I went to my first doctor's appointment and it was extremely nerve-wracking. I sat in a chair next to my mom, shaking and wondering non-stop for @NUM2 minutes. I couldn't stop running around the small room, and when I finally sat down I shouted, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!"" I simply couldn't be patient any longer. So I walked out the door just as the nurse called, ""You're next."" And I was like, ""Well that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 and a half minutes."" ""@CAPS4 it's only @NUM4 o'clock and we got here at @TIME1,"" I said. ""@CAPS5 that wasn't long at all,"" my mom agreed. Next time when I go to the doctor, I will be extra patient and wait calmly for my name to be called."
1437	19419	7	3	"Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant; a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. I’m writing about a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient. “@CAPS1,” @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he was leaving to spend his whole @DATE1 in the upper peninsula. @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 had been dating since the beginning of the year. She was sad as @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year. She had been patient all @DATE1, @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally the first day of school came; she skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called her away. A couple of confused weeks later she said to him, ""Are you jumping me or what?"" He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer, but @CAPS4 never came. Finally she decided to jump him but, she never did. So @CAPS5, Gabby, and me did. @CAPS4 for her on the outside she was mad, but on the inside she was probably screaming. Today she has “moved” on and now is dating a boy named @PERSON2, showing that her patience was ultimately tested and she found a new path forward."
1438	19420	7	3	There was a day when I was super slow. I did everything slow; I got ready for school slow, I walked slow, and I talked slow. My mom was very patient with me; all she did was encourage me to move faster. She tried to motivate me and help me get ready for school, she brought me my breakfast and put all my books into my backpack. I thanked her at the end of the day for being so patient with me, acknowledging her calm support despite my sluggish pace. That was the day someone was truly patient with me, and I learned the value of such kindness.
1439	19421	7	3	"To @CAPS4, being patient means to not whine, like if you ordered something and it's taking a long time to come to you. That’s what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life, but just one instance popped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasn’t going to be busy over there. Boy, was @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done, the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, ""I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."" My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music. ""Mom, that was our favorite song,"" @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. said, ""You have reached your destination."" Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here. @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, and @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost fainted because of how many people there were. ""Let's just calm down, I mean how long will @CAPS8 take?"" Suddenly a deep voice in my head said, ""@NUM2 hours later."" My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. ""@CAPS8, if you don’t crack @CAPS5 before it's our turn to take the pictures, I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week."" ""You have yourself a deal."" @CAPS8 took a while; another @NUM3 hours passed and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and deeper asleep @CAPS5, until ""The @PERSON1 family, you're next."" The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. ""@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet,"" I said with a big smile on my face. ""@CAPS12 you have to do anything I want."" I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in their life, just like @CAPS4 learned that day."
1440	19422	7	3	Over the @DATE1, my dad, my brother, and I went to @CAPS1 point. It was really hot but we didn’t care; we really wanted to ride the Millennium Force. We found the ride but we first looked at the line; it was huge. It snaked almost around the whole ride twice, so we got to the end of the line and sat in the blazing hot sun for a half an hour till we found our cover under a tent they put up, so it was somewhat cool in line. So we waited longer and longer till my brother started to flip out, yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, “I can’t wait here any longer!” @CAPS2 he went under the rail and ran off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour when finally, it was time for me to get on the ride, but my dad and my brother were not here so I decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride. When I got on they still weren’t there; well, the ride took off and they weren’t on it, but it was the best ride ever even without them.
1441	19423	7	3	My dad is in the @ORGANIZATION1. He goes away for long periods of time, often on important assignments. The only time he comes to visit us is in @DATE1, which is conveniently near my birthday, making it a special occasion. But one year my dad wasn't able to come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the troopers for an extra six months due to unforeseen circumstances. I felt depressed for the longest time after hearing that news. But then I thought about it more carefully. Even if his return was delayed, he was still coming back hopefully, and that was what truly mattered. So I decided to be patient rather than disappointed, focusing on the positive outcome. Our family sent him care packages over the following months to show our support. Eventually he did come back, and our patience was rewarded. That was a hard time, but we were patient and got through it together as a family.
1442	19424	7	3	When it comes to patience you have to be relaxed and maintain a calm state of mind. You have to be consistent with your patience when you go to do things at the doctor's office. When you're at the doctor you will still be done being patient, having waited your turn quietly. When you get home you will likely be patient for someone else, perhaps waiting for a family member. So remember to make sure you practice patience at everything you do throughout your day.
1443	19425	7	3	I decided to write about a time when I was patient. One time when we went to @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2, it was a very exciting day. My family and I couldn’t wait to go on the @ORGANIZATION3, a famous attraction there. But the line was humongous, stretching far across the park. I was the only one who got to go on the @ORGANIZATION3 in the end. Because I stayed in line to go on the @ORGANIZATION3, I had to wait a very long time. My family kept going on different rides like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ride and the @CAPS3 or even the @ORGANIZATION1, having fun elsewhere. While I stood in line at the @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 Ferris wheel and the fun house later, I remained determined. That very same day I got to go to the star in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 and waited in the humongous line at the cash register for a souvenir. By the time I had got up to the cash register my family was already getting massages. I was truly patient at @ORGANIZATION2, and it taught me a valuable lesson about waiting for what you want.
1444	19427	7	3	RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here! It took lots of my patience to stay quiet and not scream to the world during the long ride. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot about self-control. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders, all excited for the adventure. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our three day stay at @ORGANIZATION1, an outdoor education center. I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrassed, but @CAPS4 I didn’t care because the excitement was overwhelming. I finally snapped to it and kept my cool, taking a deep breath. In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead on how to make my project about @ORGANIZATION1 & a friend in my group named @PERSON1 told me some ideas. @CAPS4 I wanted to have her help, @CAPS4 so I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they weren’t bad at all. I thought about the suggestions and used them in my painting. Later now we’re at the nearly @NUM1 feet high rope ladder, a daunting challenge. I already took my turn going up and zipping down the awesome yet scary @CAPS3 zip line. I was now helping keep people steady on the ladder. I was patient, @CAPS4 man, they took forever to climb! I was about to scream at this one dude for moving so slowly, @CAPS4 but I said to myself “be patient.” @CAPS4 Then this one kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he just sat right on one of the big planks of wood, not moving. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top, using his imagination. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience had grown significantly, to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would start to shrink to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being an idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most, keeping my composure.
1445	19428	7	3	One day I was watching @CAPS1 on television, but it wasn't very entertaining. I was bored there was nothing good on any of the channels. So I went to see my mom who was on the computer, busy with her work. I told her if I can get on when she was finished, and she was like ok, just give her a moment. In @NUM1 mins, she said she would be done. I waited for her to be done, trying not to pester her. Ok now you can go on, she finally said. Thanks mom, I replied gratefully. You're welcome, she answered with a smile. I was very patient during that entire wait. That’s the time I was patient to go on the computer, and it felt good to have waited respectfully.
1446	19429	7	3	One time when I was patient was a fantastic and thrilling amusement park adventure! We were by the water park most of the day and, it was fun. I spent more of my time in the wave pool and on the lazy river—my favorite ride. We were getting somewhat tired of the water park and decided to go to the rides! We were trying to decide whether or not we wanted to go on the roller coaster or the Ferris wheel. I decided to go on the roller coaster and when we got there the line was like an hour long. So I endured the long, winding queue and after a while we were next in line. Unfortunately, the ride was having technical difficulties that prevented it from running, getting us all disappointed when it was announced that we had to go and leave the line. For the thunderous coaster, the park was closing, “too bad we stayed in the water park for so long!” I waited then, hoping I will come back next year and got in line, asking my mother softly, “Maybe you can see I have experienced patience.”
1447	19430	7	3	One time I had to be patient was on my birthday. One year my grandpa and grandma were late for my birthday party. I had to wait a few hours for them to arrive. I sat down quietly in the living room until they finally got here. When they arrived, we all got to eat the delicious birthday cake my mom had made. After that, I finally got to open my presents from them. It took them about an hour for them to get here because of the heavy traffic on the roads, but I was glad I waited patiently for them.
1448	19431	7	3	We're here at Cedar Point. I was so excited I felt like I was going to go crazy. “Can we go on the Dragster first?” My dad said, “Why not, it'll be fun.” When we got in line, it was an estimated wait of an hour. “Do you still want to ride the ride?” my dad asked. “Sure I do,” I replied, so I knew I would have to be patient before I could ride. While we waited, it was hot and when one minute went by it felt like an hour, but I knew when it was time my patience would pay off. When thirty minutes passed, the Dragster was in sight. Cling, cling! We were second in line. Zoom! A car went by, primarily a blue long Dragster car stopped and it had my name all over it. I got in and it was so testing of my patience; it was like three minutes before the ride started, “Hold on!” At the top we went up the hill and it was like a meteorite crashing down into earth. When it was over my patience paid off and I will always be patient because of the Cedar Point Dragster.
1449	19432	7	3	I am writing a story about a time when I was patient. When I was in fifth grade I went to a popular restaurant in the city. I ordered with my mom and dad and waited for our meals. The waiter said it would be about twenty minutes. Our food didn’t come after twenty minutes, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, or even sixty minutes. Our food finally came after an hour and fifteen minutes. All the time I was waiting I was getting more and more hungry. I didn’t start complaining or yelling; I just sat in my seat and waited patiently for our dinner to arrive.
1450	19433	7	3	When I hurt my hand on the same day of my field trip, I was patient. I fell in the hall and I went to the school office, where I waited patiently for them to call my mom to pick me up. When my mom arrived, she said she was going to take me to the emergency room. It took a while to find a parking spot at the hospital, and when we got there, I was patient even though my hand was hurting. Then we finally found one and went inside. My mom went to the front desk to tell them I was there. We waited for a little while and then a nurse came out and we went into a room to talk; she said I would have to wait for a bed to open up for x-rays. I saw a lady through the window and I knew it was for me; she opened the doors and asked for me by name. She had us follow her to a room where we waited about forty-five minutes for a doctor to come in and take us to the x-ray room. When they finished, we went back to the room and waited a while longer until the doctor came in and said I didn't break anything. He gave me a brace and I went home; through all of that, I was patient.
1451	19434	7	3	I was patient when my birthday came. I am waiting for my party at my dad's house this @DATE1. My birthday was actually on @DATE2, which was @NUM1 days ago. I am getting a @CAPS1 from my dad for my birthday, and I am trying hard to wait calmly for it. I was patient when my birthday came, and I am continuing to wait for my party at my dad's house this @DATE1. My birthday was on @NUM1 on @DATE2, and I am getting a @CAPS1 from my dad for my birthday, which makes the wait feel worthwhile.
1452	19435	7	3	"""Just @NUM1 more days and I'll be on my way to Cedar Point. I wonder what we’ll do when we first get there? What will end up being my favorite ride? Maybe I can talk my mom into going on the trip @NUM1 days early?"" ""@CAPS2 Mom,"" said @PERSON1. ""@CAPS3,"" said her mother. ""@CAPS4, we @CAPS1 go to Cedar Point now?"" ""@CAPS5, sweetie, our tickets are for @DATE1. You're @CAPS1 going to have to be patient."" ""Okay, I’ll do my best."" ""That's my girl!"" As @PERSON1 was on her way up to her room, she was thinking that maybe if she tried getting her mind off of it, she would forget about the wait. So to do this, she called her friend @CAPS6 to see if she wanted to come over. @CAPS6 said, ""@CAPS3!"" Later, ""@CAPS7"" went the doorbell. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS6, wanna go play in my room?"" ""Sure."" @CAPS10 that night, @CAPS6 went home and @PERSON1 went to bed. @NUM3 days @CAPS10. Only one more day to go! @CAPS10 that night, @PERSON1 went to bed around @NUM4 to get a good sleep for the trip. But to her @ORGANIZATION1 surprise, she woke up @CAPS1 a couple hours @CAPS10. She was so excited she couldn’t sleep! She finally fell asleep, and they left early the next morning for their fun day."
1453	19436	7	3	Patience is useful in certain times, like waiting for a blood test or, to me, your turn again. In other times, patience is useless, as in the army—any army—where you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy. Patience is mostly good because if you rush, you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just miss something you would have enjoyed. It is a virtue that helps us navigate the different challenges of life, both big and small.
1454	19437	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and I was waiting to get on the Dragster; the line was super long. We waited for @NUM1 hours long, and we were still in line, being patient. Finally, we got up there, and they said that the ride would be closed for a while because they had to check something, and it took them a whole hour to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park, and we were waiting for the train to come; it took the train @NUM2 minutes, and when we got to the other side, the ride I wanted to get on, which was Shoot the Rapids, had a line that was really long. So we waited and waited, and finally, it was our turn; we got on, and it was fun. Then when it was over, we got back on the train and went back to the other side. We went back to the Dragster, and then the line was long again, and we waited and waited, and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait; that was my first day that I ever had to hold my patience that long. I was about to lose my mind, but we had done it, and we are going back this @CAPS3, hopefully for a shorter wait.
1455	19438	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to a fair, and we had to wait in line for like two hours. I was bored just standing there, but I really wanted to go on the rides, and that’s what I was waiting in line for. I was trying to be patient the whole time in line so I could get my @CAPS1 and go on the ride because I hated just standing there. The whole time, my feet started to hurt really bad because I was standing in one place for so long. I finally got to the front of the line to get my ticket; I was so happy, and that was a time when I was patient and it finally paid off.
1456	19439	7	3	A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, or friends, or teachers are talking. I don't interrupt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are completely done talking before I start to talk, which shows them respect. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say and try to understand their point of view. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink from the water fountain, or getting your lunch in the cafeteria, or going in a single file line for a firedrill. You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient and they help me get along with others every day.
1457	19440	7	3	"Hi, I'm @PERSON1 And this is A time of when I was patient. My mom and my step dad were going to take me And my step sister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. BUT!! There was A twist we couldn't ask ""Are we there yet"". So we had to wait A really long time in the car, looking out the window and playing quiet games to pass the hours. But when got there we got there it so worth the wait because the place was even more fun than we had imagined."
1458	19441	7	3	"Patience is tough to achieve sometimes. But that doesn't mean you should give up keep trying and your will succeed, rush through life and become impatient and you used and succed. I will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. ""@CAPS1 year in the fall a big race takes place. All the animals in the @CAPS2 come to the. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that @CAPS1 year, one slow animal and one first around commute to see who is this up is champion. At the time the @CAPS5 was the fastest @CAPS2 around. @CAPS11 signed up @CAPS1 year and won @CAPS1 time. The @CAPS15 had signed up to complete this year. @CAPS11 was very wat don't in himself and was had to pride that @CAPS12 because @CAPS11 was about, slow and @CAPS11 can't be a champion. ""runners get ready!"" shouted the announcer. The @CAPS5 and @CAPS15 lined up. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! "" @CAPS5 rushed ahead kicking the air. For the @CAPS15 very slowly waiting behind. @CAPS5 run like @CAPS11 has never won. @CAPS11 never looked back. @CAPS11 wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his any ways. Right? I mean, @CAPS11 was the fastest animal. @CAPS15 continued on his way, slowly but surely making his way to the finish line. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS6 ."" @CAPS5 stopped and looked around. No one was around. ""@CAPS9 is that noise?"" @CAPS11 asked aloud. ""@CAPS6"" it came from his stomach @CAPS11 was so caught up in the race @CAPS11 didn't realize how hungry @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS12 one little handful of berries."" @CAPS11 decided. @CAPS11 picked a handful, then another and another. Finally @CAPS11 was full and a little bit sleepy. ""I'll @CAPS12 take a little nap after all that @CAPS15 ain't gonna catch up anyways."" @CAPS11 laid down and slept. Little did @CAPS5 know that the whole time @CAPS11 was eating and napping, @CAPS15 was catch up? @CAPS11 saw the @CAPS5 sleeping and decided but to wake him @CAPS12 to case @CAPS11 was sick is @CAPS11 continued to slowly very slowly walk up the hill to the inish line. @CAPS5 woke to the sound or cheering. @CAPS11 stood up. The @CAPS15 won! @CAPS11 raced to the finish line but was to late, the @CAPS15 had already won. If @CAPS11 had been patient @CAPS11 might have won, which shows that steady and persistent effort often triumphs over rushed haste."
1459	19442	7	3	"In my thirteen years of expirience I have road many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster these is normally a two hour wait. In the @DATE1 @NUM1 I took my best friend @PERSON1 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" and we had just gotten in line for a ride called ""The @CAPS3."" When we got to the entrance @CAPS4 said a forty-five minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours, which tested our patience. Finally the ride was up and running but @CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that ended @CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @CAPS4 didn't realy affect us. We finaly road that ride and was totaly worth @CAPS4 because the thrill was incredible. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down, but the memory of finally riding it makes the long wait a good story."
1460	19443	7	3	I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I was patient for about four months. I was waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. And I was extremely patient for this. So basically what happened was that there was this new, high tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 . Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out in every store we checked. So for christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited, trying not to complain. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad wake me up. He said that they were selling alot of @CAPS3 at a store across town. So we got in the car, drove to watiest, and waited in the line for a long time in the cold. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up. The next day, I finally played my @CAPS1 and it was everything I had hoped for: And thats a story about a time I have been patient and how it finally paid off in the end.
1461	19444	7	3	My mom went to the doctor's office a couple of weeks ago before school started. We went there at like eight in the morning and didn’t leave till almost noon. So me and my little sister played a game to entertain ourselves while we waited. We watched the television in the corner, played games on our iPods, and we told each other silly stories because we were so incredibly bored. So once all that got boring we just had to sit and wait and sit and wait some more; I just thought about how much longer it was going to be until we could finally leave. The waiting room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, and I kept thinking I saw the deer head mounted on the wall move, like it was about to fly right out of its place. But turns out it was just someone else shifting in their seat. After a while, my little sister and I both fell asleep in the stiff chairs. Then all of a sudden I felt someone shaking me and saying “Lexi, Taylor,” my mom called over and over until we finally woke up. She said she was all done and now we were ready to go and head to the mall. So we went and spent the rest of that enjoyable day at the mall, which was much better than waiting. And that was my story about the time that I was a patient person sitting in a doctor’s office for a very long time.
1462	19445	7	3	“Mom, can I get a puppy?” “Not now, honey.” “But Mom,” she pleaded, “just a puppy for my birthday in the spring, just be patient.” “It’s a big decision.” The little girl made her way down the stairs to sulk in the living room, where she thought of a brilliant plan to make the sixty days until her birthday go faster. “I know,” she said, “I will make a sixty-link long paper chain.” Each and every day, or sometimes counting down the days, she ripped one paper link off. She ripped them off after school, then before bed, and even counted down the weeks and months. Before she knew it, it was finally the morning of her birthday. She sprang out of bed, ran to the chain, ripped the last link off and said, “Mom, can I have a puppy yet? I was so patient.” “Well, you see,” said her mom gently. “Your dad and I have been thinking, and it is a very big responsibility, so let’s talk about it again next spring.” “Okay,” she sighed, “I’ll be patient.”
1463	19446	7	3	This is a story about a vampire named Drake who goes to a regular middle school. It was the first day of school and Drake was waiting in a long, slow-moving line for his class schedule and his new locker combination. And this line was really, really long. Drake was already late on his first day and he had to get in the way back of the line, which made him groan. The person in front of him kept complaining nonstop and Drake was getting more and more irritated. “This will take forever!” complained the person in front. “Hey, shut up, man. I don't like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining?” exclaimed Drake suddenly. Everyone in the crowded gymnasium stopped talking at once and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign for someone trying to blend in. Drake immediately stopped talking and just stared at his feet, waiting in line quietly. After twenty long minutes of listening to music on his iPod Nano, he was finally just two people away from the front of the line. Then something bad happened. “Wait, this isn’t my schedule!” said a blonde girl loudly. The person who was giving out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had taken her schedule by mistake. So fifteen more minutes passed until he finally got his correct schedule. If Drake hadn't practiced patience, he wouldn't have stood the entire forty-five minutes in that line! It was a good thing he remembered to bring his iPod Nano to help pass the time.
1464	19447	7	3	A time I was patient was waiting for what felt like six to seven whole months for my baby brother, Jacob, who is five years old now. The wait felt like two thousand years; it was so incredibly long I could hardly stand it, but I had to use patience to wait for him. He was due on the tenth of September, but instead he decided to come out a little early on the twenty-fifth of August. I remember waiting at my grandma's house, wondering when the call would come. Finally, at five in the morning on that day, my dad called to say my brother Jacob was finally born. All that waiting for those long months was totally worth it in the end. That was definitely a time I used a lot of patience.
1465	19448	7	3	I remember when me, my brother, my dad and my mom were at Cedar Point. I wanted to go on so many exciting rides but they all had big, long lines. So we waited for the Raptor, which took one full hour just to get on the ride, but when we finally got on it felt like the ride itself was even longer than the wait in line; it felt like two hours because of how fast and thrilling it was. After that, we walked over and saw the Millennium Force; it had a huge, winding line for it, so we got in line. That wait was much longer than the Raptor's line; it was like three to four hours of standing and inching forward. But when we got to the very front and were next to get on, the excitement was amazing. It was so much fun because we had waited so long, and my brother even stopped complaining because he was so proud of me for being so patient. The ride itself was incredibly fun, but when we were done we had to leave because it was getting late. My mom said we only got on two rides all day, but it was still fun and a good lesson in waiting. That was a time when I was really patient.
1466	19449	7	3	"My friend and others showed loyalty in a play called ""The Children’s Adventure."" They come once every year for a special week-long workshop. Everyone gets ready, learns their parts, and we put on a show in a week. We showed loyalty by believing in each other and building trust during rehearsals. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other completely. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by quietly reminding them the next time they were due on stage. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by whispering it for them or by improvising a line to cover the pause. We showed each other loyalty throughout all seven days of practice and performance. The play turns out great each and every year from supporting each other, and that mutual trust is what makes the experience so rewarding and successful for everyone involved."
1467	19450	7	3	I was patient when I was at the emergency room after I broke my finger a week ago almost. The waiting area was crowded, and I knew I would have to wait my turn to be seen by a doctor. I sat quietly, despite the throbbing pain, understanding that the medical staff were attending to other patients who also needed care. I did not complain or get upset about the long wait. Instead, I remained calm and passed the time by reading a magazine. This experience taught me that sometimes, being patient is necessary, especially in situations where you are not the only one needing help. In the end, the doctor treated my finger, and I left feeling that my patience had made a difficult situation much more manageable.
1468	19451	7	3	I am not a very patient person by nature. However, there was a time in my life where I was extremely patient. I was in fifth grade and was participating in a reading buddy program with Mrs. Bowe's second grade class. We would go down there once a week to help the younger students with their reading. As you probably know, second graders are not very good readers, but there was one girl who was not good at all. She needed extra help from everybody, and Mrs. Bowe would send me down to the reading corner to help the girl specifically. She struggled a lot and would often get frustrated; she would shut the book as though it were on fire. But I was patient, and every time she stopped reading, I would gently make her keep going. Every time she threw it on the floor, I would pick it up and encourage her to try again. Eventually the girl saw that her frustration didn't accomplish anything, so, she just read. Now I had to be patient with how slow she was reading. If she didn't know a word I would help her sound it out, letter by letter. The girl kept getting better and better at reading until she didn't need me anymore. I was proud of myself for being patient for once and for helping someone else succeed through my perseverance.
1469	19454	7	3	My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something, you have to wait until they are done. If you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong, which helps no one. Being patient is a very important thing in life, whether you are waiting for a friend to finish a task or for a family member to get ready to go out. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you are not being rude or demanding. It shows that you value their time and effort as much as your own. This simple act of waiting calmly can prevent arguments and build stronger, more understanding relationships with the people around you. In the end, practicing patience makes daily life much smoother and more pleasant for everyone involved.
1470	19455	7	3	There are many times I was patient, but this one was not too long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the MEAP test. I finished the required sections early and then just sat there, not allowed to do anything else. I just read the instructions again and doodled in the margins of my scrap paper. It was absolutely boring, lame, and seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didn't complain; I just sat there quietly and did nothing, as the rules required. And that was probably the worst part—wanting to talk or move around but knowing I couldn't. I had to exercise immense self-control until the time was finally called, and I could leave the silent, tense room. That experience, while challenging, proved to me that I could be patient even under the most tedious circumstances.
1471	19456	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was in school, sitting in my math class. I was waiting to be sent out so I could go see my friends at @ORGANIZATION1. I was waiting and watching and waiting and watching and waiting and watching the clock, but it was not turning. So I started doing my class work to pass the time. Then the @ORGANIZATION2 finally rang, and I was happy again. There is one thing to note: it was not a regular school day because we had the MEAP test, so it was only a half-day schedule in all classes. We only had about @NUM1 minutes left until the time school let out for moms to pick us up. I waited some more, and then @NUM2 minutes passed. Then me and my friend realized that was good, as we only had @NUM2 minutes to go, then @NUM4 minutes, then @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8, @NUM9, @NUM10, @NUM11, and finally @NUM12 minutes left. Now, with just @NUM1 seconds remaining, the @ORGANIZATION2 rang, and that is what happened when I was patient and waited for the end of the school day.
1472	19457	7	3	Someone was in line for a Hot & Ready pizza, expecting it to be instantly available since they are advertised as hot and ready. A lot of people were in line, and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza was supposed to be immediately accessible. Everybody was throwing tantrums. The kids, however, were sitting quietly at the little benches provided, watching the adults having their fits. The people that work behind the counter were trying their best because there were a lot of people and everybody was causing a commotion. Nobody showed any patience; they just cared about getting their pizza. The little kids who were hungry were showing more patience than the angry adults. They were all whining, and everybody said they didn't want to hear anyone else, so you had to shut up. After he was there, patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut, he didn't bother to speak. Eventually, everybody calmed down and returned to normal, and everybody had a smile on their faces. Even the little kids got their pizza really fast once order was restored. The experience showed that it is always best to be patient.
1473	19458	7	3	I asked my mom if I could have something to eat. She didn't say yes right away, so I waited. I waited, then waited some more, and then I went upstairs and I waited again. I was very hungry, but I was being patient that whole time. I usually get the food I am used to having, and I do. Another time, on Thanksgiving, I was also patient. They were cooking the turkey, and they hadn't cooked it yet, so we waited until the turkey was ready. Our stomachs were growling for the turkey the entire time. So I remained a man of patience, and I waited until the turkey was finally done and ready to eat.
1474	19459	7	3	Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don't. It shows your character to people, revealing if you are patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a restaurant that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored, so I decided to color with the crayons I got. After I was finished with that, I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to join the conversation. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came, so I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk and then went to the bathroom. When I came back, our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient, I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If you're not a patient person, then you can always try to become one. It's not very hard; you just need to keep yourself occupied with other activities.
1475	19460	7	3	A time when I used patience was when I finished my book. We have these things called teacher talks where you tell the teacher about the book you finished. I finished a series of @NUM1 books called “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.” I had finished the last two books. I wrote my name on the board for a teacher talk. The teacher kept picking other people, so I had to wait until I got called. Every day I would go to my @NUM2 and @NUM3 hour classes hoping I would be called, but every day it wouldn't happen. I finished another book, so I wrote my name on the board again, but I still didn't get called. I put a tally mark next to my name, @PERSON1 @NUM4, which meant I had finished @NUM5 books in total. Eventually, on @DATE1, my name finally got called. I went to the teacher with all @NUM5 of my books. I got to tell her about my books, and I was very happy that I finally got my name called after waiting so patiently.
1476	19462	7	3	"I was patient at the dentist office. When I went to the dentist office, I was getting my braces put on. When I was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and wire ready. While they were getting the brackets and wire I got to pick out colors for the bands. I waited about @NUM1 mins without complaining a single time. Next, they started putting the brackets on with the special glue. When they put one bracket on I felt so weird and the glue tasted like heated metal. ""ì@CAPS1î"" I said quietly. After they had put on all the brockets, they then put the colors on the wires. My mouth hurt like crazy from being held open for so long! When it was all over I noticed it had been @NUM2 hours! I was surprised because I didn’t know I sat there for @NUM2 hours, but I was very patient and waited that whole time without fidgeting! That’s the time I was patient at the dentist office, and I felt proud of myself for handling it so well."
1477	19463	7	3	A time when I was being very patient was when I went to “ì@CAPS1î” at Cedar Point. I went to Cedar Point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins for a special girls' day out. It was just the older girls going, because we knew if we took the little people we couldn’t go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one briefly. It was so fun until we got to the lines for the major rides. They were ridiculously long; I mean it literally took us about an hour and a half just to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time to pass the time. We were in the back of the whole section, called “The Dead Zone”, and it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling that was. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, with more stairs to climb and safety bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain? Not me. I was patient, unlike my cousins who started to get restless. We finally got to the top floor and can you believe it, we still had to wait in another line. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but that didn't last for long. Then we looked over the railing and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fall. Then we went on and on talking about other things. But soon after that we heard the staff say “we're going to hold off for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn’t have any mechanical problems.” That’s when my cousins went off, complaining loudly. We tried to get her to calm down, and so we all just sat down and waited quietly. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the very top where we could board the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster up close, and I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, maybe because we were so excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funnest rides in the whole park called “The Maureen”. I guess the long wait was worth it in the end. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were huge drops, and it was incredibly fun. We were a little patient, but did we have enough patience to get back on and wait in that line again? I don’t think so, and we decided to find a shorter line for our next adventure.
1478	19464	7	3	One day when I was buying a dirt bike helmet online it said three day shipping and to me it wasn’t very long at all. I was so excited for it to arrive. When the third day came and I was waiting on my porch for my helmet to come, my mom broke the news to me that my helmet got stuck in a warehouse in @LOCATION1 and it wouldn’t be here until next week. After she told me I figured that I just had to be patient, as there was nothing else I could do. For the next week I just went to work with my dad to keep my mind off of it. After my week was up, I was sitting on my porch waiting once more and I almost fell asleep from the boredom when suddenly a @ORGANIZATION1 truck came down the street and gave me my brand new helmet. It was a great lesson in practicing patience.
1479	19465	7	3	"One time my friend was waiting for me to get out of the bathroom. I stayed in there a whole hour because I was taking my time getting ready. He waited for me the entire time, even though he couldn't go in. When I finally got out of the bathroom I said, ""Thanks for waiting,"" and he said, ""Anytime."" I was genuinely surprised at her kindness and patience, and it made me appreciate our friendship even more."
1480	19466	7	3	"When it was almost @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I could not wait for @DATE1 to arrive, I tried to open my gifts early. My mom and dad give my sister and my second sister and me money every year. They give us money so we can go buy things that we like for ourselves. My dad and mom give us money, just like my mom and dad does, and I remember I bought a pair of cute combat boots with mine. I could not wait to open the boots on @DATE1 and I was @CAPS2 up and down with excitement, asking ""Can we open just one gift? It is almost @DATE1 @CAPS1!"" and my mom and dad said no firmly. So I got mad and went to bed. The next day I woke up on @DATE1 and it was above @NUM1 in the morning. I looked in the living room and no one was up yet, so I had to wait until my parents woke up. I could not wait and the time was taking forever, just ticking by slowly. That was a time that I really could not wait, and it taught me that sometimes the anticipation is the hardest part."
1481	19467	7	3	I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things. If you are patient, things will actually come faster than you think. For example, if you want something and you have to wait in a line, instead of running off and finding something else to do, it will always help to just wait. Be patient with whatever you are doing, just be patient even if it is waiting for the school day to be over. If you are waiting for a game at the gym to come, just have patience and wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient with whatever you are doing, even if you are waiting for a turn, just wait as it is not a big deal. Stop rushing things and just be very patient, and you will find everything works out better in the end.
1482	19468	7	3	“John on Mark, where are you,” Tom said in a frustrated undertone. Mark was supposed to come over to his house. Tom had just gotten a new trampoline and they were planning on bouncing all day after school. Tom was starting to get worried but he waited patiently by the window. Finally his mom came and told him that Mark wasn’t coming. That's when the phone rang. Tom answered it and heard Mark on the other end. “Sorry, Tom,” Mark croaked. He didn’t sound well. “Mark,” Tom shouted into the phone, “Mark, Mark where are you?” “I’m at my house, get over here.” Tom’s mom pulled up at Mark’s house and let him out. Tom didn’t care about manners at this point, so he opened the door and marched to Mark’s room. Mark was laying in bed looking up at the ceiling with his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at Tom, held his gaze, then looked back at the ceiling. Mark wasn’t at school that day either. He explained, “I went skiing up at my family cottage. I wasn’t patient when I was in the air and I tried a jump I wasn't ready for. I got crushed and none of it would have happened if I had waited for the right moment.”
1483	19469	7	3	One time I was patient was at my dad's house. Our power had just gone out so we figured we would wait for up to two minutes just like it always happened before. After a couple of days, we still didn't have power and I was getting impatient. On day three, we called the power people and they figured out a tree had fallen on our power lines. They came and fixed it, and we finally got our power back. It was a good lesson in waiting for things to be resolved properly.
1484	19470	7	3	There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, then you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your math test early and you kept telling everyone else to hurry up, it’s distracting. Now that you’ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they might have to start their work over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and he pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return. My sister kept wanting to call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient you can get hurt. Let’s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them; they could get very hurt from a fall. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten if we want to live together safely and respectfully.
1485	19471	7	3	“Tick, tick, tick,” the clock was counting down. “Tick, tick, tick,” so close, come on, I whispered as the clock kept going. My heart was beating like a race car engine. I could hear my heart go boom, boom, boom as my mind raced with what I was going to do for fun—jump in the pool, watch a video, play a game. So many options, what should I do? “Tick, tick, tick,” I could almost hear the pool calling to me, “swim, swim, swim.” What should I do? I looked at Mrs. Sprowl, then back at the clock, then at Mrs. Sprowl, then back at the clock and Mrs. Sprowl again. My heart was almost jumping out of my body with so much anticipation. “Tick, tick, tick,” “almost there,” I said as I stared at the second hand. “Tick, tick, tick,” so close I said, so close, just one second left then I can swim in my pool. “Three,” I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled, “Two, one!” “Class, class, class,” we have some announcements, said Mrs. White. I was happy when it was over and I ran outside to wait for my dad so I could finally have my freedom and start the summer.
1486	19472	7	3	I was patience the whole entire time, maintaining a calm and steady demeanor throughout the experience. I was happy on the outside, putting on a brave and content face for everyone to see, but on the inside, I was quietly wrestling with my own thoughts, and I truly wish I got a better score to reflect the effort I felt I had put in.
1487	19473	7	3	As a child my mom always taught me about patience, a lesson I couldn't quite grasp back then, which is why I’m writing this about her now. My mom is very nice, cool, wealthy, and most of all patient. There were so many things I did as a child, and still some things now, that would test her, yet my mom would just calmly collect herself as if we didn't even do anything wrong. It's kinda funny how much patient she has, a seemingly endless supply. Along time ago, I have a clear memory of wasting grape pop on her new carpet!! Wow how scared did I get….I think I wet my pants!! Instead of hiding it like any other kid would, when she got home I immediately cried to her that I wasted pop on your carpet, pleading don't get mad. She replied in her soothing mother loving voice, telling me exactly how to clean it up. I passed her a dry towel and smiled, explaining just remember this time a kid I can't reach the sink's) Without yelling she walked, she walked up stairs and wet the towel her self. I stayed down stairs looking at the ugly purple mess I made, still trying to help my mom, but she just told me to sit down. She said this holding my hand gently. By this time momma got done with the stain I was fast a sleep on the couch. My mom gave me a kiss on the cheek and didn't wake me up!! The gig was up soon as she picked me up. I said in my morning voice, is that you?? My mom being so patient simply smiled. I then asked what's for breakfast?? in a high pitched voice. I will get on it she said while taking out my breakfast. I love my mom.
1488	19474	7	3	Last year we went to the amusement park, it was about two weeks before school started. That day schools by the park had just opened so there was no lines to wait in. We couldn’t have picked a better day. Then we got to the mantice ride and I didn’t want to go on it, but my mom said nothing will go wrong, okay? I said fine I’ll go on to the ride. We are about to take off going up the hill and right when we got to the top the ride stops.’ I was freaking out at first but then I got over it. So we have been up there for about ten min or so and we had to be patient.’ My mom and dad are on the inside of them.’ We were sitting on bicycle seats and they were not comfy. So then another five min pasted by and now we have been stuck at the top for fifteen mins.’ This is were we had to be completely quiet and patient, just waiting for something to happen. Then the ride started and we got down to the bottom and finished the ride. They gave us a pass for us to cut in line on the tornado force ride. That is all they gave us. So we had fun the rest of the day, but that day I learned in life you have to have patience!
1489	19475	7	3	Once upon a time their was a princess named Isabella. She was invited to a royal ball where she awaited her handome prince. As her carriage arrived she paused at the people before getting out, taking a deep and steadying breath. Finally she stepped out of the vehicle. Isabella walked gracefully down the red carpet. As she arrived, the more noisy it got as the princess finally aproched the opened doors. The beautiful girl walked to her throne and warched the village people dance among her. She sat for two hours, waiting with a quiet and hopeful heart. She wandered will he show up? and will he like me? She doubted her luck as the minutes continued to pass. The princess grabed the microphone, calling out into the hall! Does anyone know where my prince is? A complete silence went over the croud, and for a moment, it seemed all was lost. Finally at the last minute, an anonomyse voice called out from the back. I am the prince! A sigh of relif came over her. He explained, I’m so late, I fought a dragon and a thousand knights to get here to meet my love! awwwww! The crowd said softly. And they lived happily ever after, their patience finally rewarded.
1490	19476	7	3	The one time I was patient is when my mom took me to go get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there the parking lot was full I mean cars was so close you could hardly get in and out without scratching someones car. My mom parked across the streets. When we got in there it was at least fifty to sixty people it packed. People were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like sardines. It was hot and smelled like must, a truly unpleasant atmosphere. We picked a ticket with sixty-five on it and they were on twenty-two. We waited for two hours, just sitting and standing in the crowded room. My mum wanted to leave out of sheer frustration. When they finally got to our number I was fast sleep, completely worn out from the long and tedious wait. Wile we was in there I lost ten pounds from all the heat and standing.
1491	19477	7	3	I’m not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole while without complaining, then I guess there are some times when I’ve been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about four hours. My friend Sarah was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didn’t complain once. Then we got yelled at by a nurse and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn’t too bad. That was one of the few times I’ve been patient, and I don’t know if it counts since I was with somebody, but it felt like a small victory over my usual restlessness.
1492	19478	7	3	“Mine!” I yelled as the ball came over the net right to me. “That was mine!” Katie said. “But I was already there,” I responded. “No way. But it’s mine,” Sarah argued. “Hey, I said mine, you moved and let me get it then wimp bumped me. And watch the ball drop,” I exclaimed. “Sorry, I guess,” Katie apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. “Listen up everyone!” the A team coach demanded. “Now partner up in groups of three!” the coach said. My two best friends Sam and Sarah were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. “You want to be partners with me and make a group?” Sarah asked. “Sure,” I responded. When it was our turn on the court we were going against Jessica, who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, Sarah and Jessica all cheered. “Excellent! Very nice job ladies!” shouted one of the coaches. It was the end of the second day of tryouts. There was only one more day left. It was hard for me but I managed to keep together and patient. On the final day of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, Jessica, and Sarah plus some other good girls made the A-team! So that’s a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, but I still came through and succeeded in the end.
1493	19479	7	3	Once upon a time there was a boy named Alex. He was right and he was at the secretary of state and he tried to be patient so he walked in and took a number and got his paper from the woman at the front desk to fill out and started filling it out and got it done and this only on number thirty, she was counting slow so he’s getting angry! And time went by and finally it’s on twenty-nine and there’s one person in front of him and they leave to go get their secretary of state card and the person in front of him is up the lady behind the desk opened up and called Alex and he greeted her with a smile she took this picture and he got his license then the story ends with him feeling relieved it was finally over.
1494	19480	7	3	I was patient when my dog had to go the vet; he was really sick because he had heart worms my mom and I just waited for about two hours. I was not as patient as my mom because I keep asking my mom what was going on. After the operation was done we had to wait even longer until we got my dog Bear back almost four hours. After the vet called us we went and got my dog and the doctor said that he had to drink water until he could be up and moving and it was finally okay and we played in the snow all afternoon long, which made the long wait feel worth it.
1495	19481	7	3	AHH! Oh hi my name is Jake I’m going to tell you how I waited two whole hours to do something sweet. Ok I heard about this awesome but scary place called the new haunted house! Me and a few friends of mine Mark and Chris plan to go there in October. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. Waking up, washing in the shower, getting dressed, going to school. Today, we are going to my parents’ house and go online to see when it opens. We found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of the community center. So we check it out and its nearby so we are so ready to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle taken away. Today is the day we are on the road but what we did realize was how many people would be there. When we got there it had at least a hundred people waiting! We sat in line and about every ten minutes the line decreased by five people. Then finally about an hour and a half of waiting we were in the top twenty. It was just our luck too, twenty people were not patient enough to wait but we were respectful. Then Mark had to go use the rest room so we walked across the street so he could go then when we came back we ended up in the top fifteen! We waited another half hour then we were in! By the time we were done Mark was crying (he is fifteen!) Chris wet his pants ( he is sixteen!) and seventeen and I didn’t do anything, we had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if we were not so patient and willing to wait it out.
1496	19482	7	3	Patience is an important thing to have. It helps you and others respect yourself. If you are not patient, things will only get worse. My cousin is a big @PERSON1 fan. She wanted tickets to his concert, but when they sold out online she didn't know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that they were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well, so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket booth. The sun was hot and the line moved slowly, but she stayed calm. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1's face, which shows how being patient can end up in a good result. Maybe if my cousin would not have been so patient she would not have gotten the tickets. Patience will get you a long way, especially if you are trying to gain respect. My cousin has inspired me to be a more patient person, and maybe I will get concert tickets someday because of it.
1497	19484	7	3	"When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom and dad, I learned a lot about patience. @PERSON1 has Down syndrome, and he likes to watch games. He likes to cheer the players on when they're playing. He also likes to give them high fives after they are done playing. I did not laugh at him; I thought he was a pretty cool guy. He likes to talk a lot about stuff like sports and cartoons. I didn't make fun of him when he talks, or when he walks, or when he makes noises that are funny. He thinks of everyone as his friend, which they are. When he was standing in line he didn't move very much, showing great patience. He yells when @DATE1 port has the ball and is heading for a touchdown. He gets mad when his sports team doesn't have the ball and the other team scores. I told him that we will get it back. He said, ""Yeah, I know that."" So he likes to go onto the field to watch, but they wouldn't let us on the field yet so I told him to be patient so he would calm down. When the game was over his mom took us to @LOCATION1's house. We sat in the car being loud and talking, but she did not get mad even when we had to sit in an hour of traffic jam. So after all that, what I think patience is a way of showing you care for others and their feelings."
1498	19485	7	3	Are you patient? Well, I am always patient. I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient at school. One day I had to register for school and it was very busy. I had to wait in every line for at least ten to fifteen minutes each. When I finally got all my paperwork done, I had to take my ID picture. When I took the pictures I went to get my ID. All of a sudden it printed out, but my eyes were closed in the photo. So I had to wait in the line again and take more pictures, which required more patience. Then I went to take my other ID. I waited for a very long time, like about twenty minutes. My second ID came out and it was messed up, with a smudge on it. The lady told me when I start school, I will get the correct one. I simply accepted this and did not complain. That is a time when I was patient in my life, understanding that sometimes things do not go perfectly the first time.
1499	19488	7	3	A time when I was patient was during last @DATE1. My friends and I were waiting in line to get an autograph from the Detroit Tigers @NUM1 baseman @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was going to be exciting to meet the players, but the line was incredibly long and it moved very slowly. We stood there for what felt like hours, talking amongst ourselves to pass the time. The sun was bright and it was a warm day, but we remained in our spots, determined to get that signature. People around us were getting restless and some even left, but my friends and I decided to stick it out. Eventually, we made it to the front of the line and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 signed our baseballs with a smile. We were so happy we had waited. This was a day when I was patient and it truly paid off in the end.
1500	19489	7	3	I was patient when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors, me and my mom waited patiently for a long time in the crowded waiting room. It felt like years but it was only for @NUM1 hour. I read some old magazines and watched the other families waiting their turn. Then when the doctor called us back to the room, we had to wait for another long period of time, about another half-hour, for the doctor to finally come in. I asked my mom, “Why did it take forever?” My mom said, “Because there are other people before us who also need to see the doctor.” “Oh,” I said, and I understood that waiting is just a part of life sometimes, so I sat back down and continued to wait quietly until it was finally our turn.
1501	19490	7	3	One day I was a patient person at a water park and I was waiting to get on a water slide, but there were like twenty people in front of me. At the same time, it was so hot and I didn’t know what to do, I realized the ground was burning hot if you had no flip flops on your feet. But, I really wanted to get on this water slide no matter what the discomfort was. So I stood there patiently to get on the water slide, shifting my weight from one foot to the other. Then I said to myself this better be worth it or I'm going to be furious. But it was a long line, so I decided I was gonna be patient about it. I hoped I would have fun on this ride, and eventually, my turn came.
1502	19491	7	3	I was patient last year when I was taking a very important test and it was not done on time. I really hate being patient and when I do have to wait, it is incredibly boring. Patients seem like they take forever to finally be over. And then people just start getting headaches from the stress and frustration of waiting, and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking too much because you are so restless. And that is exactly why I don’t like being patient at all.
1503	19492	7	3	Patience is when you can wait for a long period of time and not complain about the delay, but I don’t think I have very much patience myself. I think patience is like waiting in a long line for hours and not caring because you are a very patient person, but everything in life takes some patience. Playing games, driving in traffic, eating while waiting for your food, and even being at school all day, they all take a lot of patience to get through. It is a challenging skill to master for sure.
1504	19493	7	3	Every single school year I wait patiently for the summer vacation to finally arrive. It feels like a terrifyingly long time waiting for that final day, but it is always worth it in the end. The anticipation builds up with each passing week, making the final reward of freedom all the sweeter when it finally comes.
1505	19494	7	3	Hi, I’m Emma Johnson and I have green eyes, blonde hair, and I have a good personality. Okay, so I am going to tell you about a time when I was focused on being patient. Okay so it was a Tuesday last year, I think in October. My mom and I were leaving for a doctor’s appointment that afternoon. So we left around one o'clock, just after school had started. So when we got there I was just waiting for like two hours, bored out of my mind in the quiet waiting room. I didn’t know what to do so I saw the fish tank in the corner and I was watching them swim around for about an hour, doing nothing else, and then finally the woman at the counter desk said, “Johnson,” and then I knew it was our turn. So we went in the room and I layed on the exam bed. I went to sleep on accident, but while I was sleeping they gave me a painful shot and it hurt so bad that I jolted awake. Then I woke up fully and that was the time “when I was patient.”
1506	19495	7	3	One time when I was patient I got a bike last Christmas. I asked for a bike and my dad said maybe. So I waited all year, I knew I would get one but I kept waiting and you know what, I got a blue bike and on top of that two new gloves with it. But over the time I waited I was going nuts knowing I was gonna get the bike. I would see other kids riding their new bikes and feel a pang of impatience. But when I finally got it I was glad I was patient; the wait was well worth it especially because I really wanted my bike. It felt amazing to finally ride it after wanting it for so long.
1507	19496	7	3	“Mom, Mom Mom!! I want this cool new book while running down the stairs. I have to get this cool new book! It looks really really good. Please, please, please! We have to do errands before we go,” replied my mom. “If you are patient we can get the book,” persuades her mother. I, who wants the book badly, replied ok and they went to do errands. First stop they went to the gas station to fill up the car, then the post office to mail a package, then to the car wash, then finally to the grocery store. At the grocery store I helps her mom shop, carefully placing items into the cart. All day I was patient and didn’t complain once. “The last item on the list is pasta for dinner,” said my mom. “Oh no, I can’t seem to find it.” “I’ll go find it,” said I, who was eager to get her book. I looks down every aisle, past the cereals and the canned soups, until she finally finds the pasta her mom wants. When I finally finds her mom she is already in the checkout line. When the cashier is done ringing all the items, I and her mom go to their car and unload the groceries into the trunk. When they get to their house I forgot about the book until her mom came over to her and gave it to her. I said her thank yous and then realized it isn’t hard to be patient when you keep yourself busy.
1508	19497	7	3	I was patient when my mom went to the doctors and she was having a baby and I had to wait in the waiting room for two hours for her to finish. The chairs were uncomfortable and there were only old magazines to read. I watched the clock on the wall, its hands moving so slowly. I tried to think about meeting my new sibling to make the time pass. Finally, after what felt like forever, the doctor came out to tell me the good news. It was a long wait, but it was worth it to know everyone was healthy.
1509	19498	7	3	Patience, it’s something that my family doesn’t have. Here is the story. While I am doing the dishes my little brother is crying cause my little sister hit him. So since Jake is crying (my little brother), Lily starts to cry (my little sister). So then my step dad is playing on his iphone, trying to ignore the noise. He is going to yell at Jake pretty soon. And what do you know, he does. Okay, you think it’s going to get better? Nope, wrong. I get Lily to stop crying by giving her a toy. But Jake just won’t, so I call my sister in here and Jake got to hit her, then my step dad starts to go crazy cause he is still crying; now my sister is being a brat stomping up the stairs. When we finally got Jake to calm down a little, now just as I am about to go crazy, Mark (my older brother) comes in and takes Jake down stairs to calm him down. Thank goodness, for my brother. Then I calm Lily back down by reading her a story. What a day; well I guess my family does have patience, well, not my step dad. The rest of us managed to get through the chaos somehow.
1510	19499	7	3	We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well, yesterday, I was very patient with my sister, Sarah, who throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don’t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here’s the story. We were walking home from school yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn’t let Sarah go up to “clean” it because she usually just makes a bigger mess. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. Remember, she’s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her “friend” Chloe. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet again she screamed. So our sister, Emma, got fed up and said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then Sarah made us listen to Chloe’s text messages, which were coming through one after another. I’ll admit Chloe wasn’t being very nice. So we told Sarah to not answer the phone, speaking in soft and steady voices. We weren’t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream in her room until she tired herself out. Then, our mom came home. Emma and I told our mom what had happened, explaining the situation clearly. Then our mom told Sarah she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to Chloe at school. My mom also thanked Emma and I for being so patient and not escalating the situation. So that is my story about how I was patient. I’m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient and handle things calmly!
1511	19500	7	3	A time when my @CAPS1 was patient is today last week and yesterday. My @CAPS1 was so patient today as I was late for school and it was quite a delay, a man about to turn but he was stopping so @CAPS1 was patient to wait and not going in front of him or blow the loud irritating horn at him. The next time my @CAPS1 was patient is when I was in a basketball game; my @CAPS1 was out side waiting on me and we went into overtime so she just waited until I came out the building. The last time my @CAPS1 was patient is when we was in Subway; I ordered a cold cut and it took about one minute until I got my food. I was so hungry I could not feel my tummy. So in conclusion, these are the times when my @CAPS1 was patient, showing how calm and understanding they can be.
1512	19501	7	3	As we walked in, the smell of mouth wash filled our noses. We walked to the front desk where a short little lady with brown hair and glasses greeted us. “@CAPS1, take a seat in our waiting room and your dentist will be with you shortly,” said @CAPS2 the lady at the desk. We walked to the waiting room; my mom and brother sat on the waiting couch and I sat in the little tan chair in the corner. My brother got some papers and crayons while my mom read a magazine. But I was wrong; fifteen minutes went by. My mom and my brother were still doing the same thing while I was looking around the room, bored out of my mind. I kept asking my mom when the dentist would come but @CAPS4 just told me to be patient. About twenty minutes later I was @CAPS3 to lose it; I could no longer sit still, not knowing how my brother could just sit there and color for twenty minutes. I wanted to ask my mom when the dentist is going to come, but @CAPS4 would just tell me to be patient. I got up and started pacing back and forth. After five minutes of that my mom told me to sit down and find something to do. But there was nothing, nothing I could possibly do that could entertain me. Finally, when I was about to go crazy, a little lady stood in the doorway. “@CAPS3 for your appointment,” @CAPS4 @CAPS2. I got up and followed her to a small room, happy that the long waiting was finally over.
1513	19502	7	3	Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to be patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you’d have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have an orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cakes. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching a honest video of my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying person can laugh at it and call me an “epicfail”. But I still live. Playing the piece isn’t so bad, it’s just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might be torture, but at least I don’t have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all. Who says I’m going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I’m not really looking forward to this year’s @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school, where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping I’m not going to get any homework. But if I do, I’ll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. I’ll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly, and that is my plan.
1514	19503	7	3	Even though you @MONTH1 not know @CAPS1, there is patience all around us; you @MONTH1 not even know you're using the patience like waiting in a line for lunch or waiting for something, but you are. Here is a story about when I used patience. One day, on a hot @DATE1 day at wider point, we decided that we were going to go to the water park. As soon as we got there we jumped into the first pool and I waited for my dad. After a while of playing we decided to go on one of the water slides; @CAPS1 was the water slide at the park. @CAPS1 was so big you had to take @NUM1 flights of stairs to get to @CAPS1, but after I went back I knew @CAPS1 was worth the wait because the ride down was so exciting and fun.
1515	19504	7	3	My story is about a time when I was patient was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for “@CAPS1” to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldn’t wait to go but I remembered to be “patient”. The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to “@LOCATION2”. When we were in the car on our way there I couldn’t wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldn’t wait. During the long ride I fell asleep and when I had woke up, we were already there. I had to have patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states, which made the journey part of the fun adventure.
1516	19505	7	3	Patience is something that most people don’t have, and it was the central virtue I discovered I needed during a particular incident a couple of years ago. I was picked up from school by my mom, who intended to take me home but decided to stop for groceries first. When we arrived at the store, she asked if I wanted to come inside, but after thinking about all the reasons why I didn't want to, I of course said no. I remained in the car, where the temperature felt like it was at least ninety degrees outside. I was sweating profusely within just ten minutes of waiting in the stationary vehicle. My mom still wasn’t out of the store, and the time stretched on. There were so many moments when I felt the urge to become angry and frustrated, but I consciously didn’t let myself get that way. I even watched as other people entered the store and then came out with their bags long before my mom finally emerged. It was at least two full hours before she had finally come out, carrying her groceries and offering explanations and apologies for why she was so late. I wasn’t mad at her; I just understood her reasons. Most of the time I am not a patient person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that, which is why I was so profoundly glad I was able to be patient for this story.
1517	19506	7	3	Sometimes on days when I have very little patience at all, I have to consciously control myself so I don’t just go off on someone or say something totally mean to them! A perfect example was last summer when we went camping up in the mountains. We always go for about a one to two hour hike during these trips. Our destination is usually Lake Serene, but just before that, to get there, we take what my dad calls an “adventure hike!” This path takes you through dense woods and over, or sometimes even through, a shallow river. Crucially, there are two ways you could take: a direct five-minute hike straight to Lake Serene, or a much longer, hour to two-hour hike through the winding woods and over slippery logs. On days when I have very little patience at all, and just want to get straight to the lake to relax, we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates it by the time we finally get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (Honestly, sometimes I get annoyed at myself for complaining!) Then, on the way back it's usually more fun, but only after we go swimming in the freezing cold water! (My dad always says it clears my head! But it really doesn’t!) And by the time we get back to our campsite, we are all ready to have dinner, but dinner isn’t ready yet. So then I get to be in a bad mood… again! And have to wait some more, testing my patience all over again.
1518	19507	7	3	Two years ago, my two-year-old cousin Lily was adopted from China. My aunt, uncle, and their son had to wait an arduous three years before they could even see a picture of her and begin the extensive paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair or cooperative with them. They let almost twenty other people, who had begun their adoption efforts a full year after my aunt and uncle, go ahead of them in the process. My family had to travel all the way to China from their home, which was in Ohio, and then wait in a hotel for three days until they were finally permitted to just see her. After that first emotional meeting, the orphanage made them wait another entire week to finalize the adoption. Finally, the day came when they officially adopted her and named her Lily. They went through more tedious paper work, signed documents promising they would always take care of her, and then began the journey home. After they arrived, Lily didn’t sleep at all during the first week or so. Since China is twelve hours ahead of Ohio, her internal clock was completely reversed; she would sleep during the day and be wide awake at night. They eventually, with great consistency, taught her to sleep during the night. That little girl required a lot of patience from everyone, but she was finally, happily adopted into our family.
1519	19508	7	3	The time I was remarkably patient was last summer when we went to Cedar Point. The day was hot and the park was crowded. When we finally got in line for my favorite roller coaster, the line was incredibly long and moved very slowly. After what felt like an eternity, we eventually got to the front of the line, but just as it was our turn to board, the machine broke down. So then we had to go to another ride, and I couldn't wait very long in this new line because I desperately had to go to the bathroom. I walked out of the line and went to the nearest restroom. When I came back, I saw that there were many more people in the line than before. Instead of getting upset or complaining, I just took a deep breath, found my family, and waited calmly until it was finally our turn to ride.
1520	19509	7	3	My dad, Robert, is a man who demonstrates patience every single day. He goes to work at his office and, like anyone, he can't wait to come home, but he never gets stir-crazy or antsy like I do when I want to leave a place. No, he simply focuses and does his work diligently, waiting until five o'clock when he is officially allowed to leave and go home to our family. He always patiently waits until that clock strikes five, never trying to rush out early or shirk his responsibilities. My dad has always been an incredibly patient person, and I truly look up to him because of that consistent and admirable patience he shows in all aspects of his life.
1521	19510	7	3	I was at the Great Wolf Lodge and we could not go in the main indoor pool because some kid had pooped in it. A big part of the pool water had turned a murky brown, which was very unpleasant. We were disappointed to learn we could not go in for three whole hours while they cleaned it, and the waiting period felt very boring. To pass the time, we decided to go outside, and that is when we discovered there was another pool out there the whole time that we had not noticed before. We ended up having a fun time swimming outside instead, which saved the day after the unfortunate incident inside.
1522	19511	7	3	A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times but one I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school, since I had missed school that day. While waiting I did plenty of things to keep myself occupied. I played my Xbox for a while and I got on the computer. But while on Xbox I saw one of my friends come online. He lives in a different state. After he got online we played for most of the day, then I got off and watched television because I was bored. Nothing good was on so I got back on the computer, but I was still bored. So I tried to take a nap, but that didn’t work. After that I tried to play my Xbox again but after another hour, it got boring. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till my other friend finally got online. We played all day till night, and my patience was finally rewarded with a fun gaming session.
1523	19512	7	3	"My friend was patient last week in the lunch line, where he waited about fifteen minutes. I had gotten to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line. He was behind the second and third graders. He was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complain at all. The line was longer because there had been a school presentation and then it was lunchtime; the second and third graders didn't have lunch yet so that was why he had to wait. I thought he did a good job waiting. When many students were filling up the tables I saved him a seat next to me. He finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the fruit and milk cooler and grab an orange. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When he came and sat down next to me I told him he did a good job being patient and waiting to get his lunch. I was almost done with my macaroni and cheese when he said, ""Thanks for saving a seat for me."" When we both finished we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafeteria. In the gym other kids were playing a small basketball game. He grabbed a basketball. I waited until the second graders were done, I was patient, then the teacher told the younger students to go back to class. When I got the ball I asked him if he wanted to play around the world. It was one of his and my favorite games we played together, and we enjoyed a few rounds before our break was over."
1524	19513	7	3	"Boom! Boom! I knew my cousins were at the door because they were all heavy handed. So I ran down the stairs and opened the door; it was them. Then, we all got into the van. ""You all ready to have some fun?"" my mom asked, and we replied, ""Yes!!!"" It was so boring in the van but I had to be patient. After we got to Ohio we stopped and got some food. After twenty minutes we got back into the van. When we got to the amusement park we were all excited; it was going to be a good day I thought, but I also knew that it was going to take some time and patience. Next, when we got into the park we all went straight to the roller coaster. It was a half an hour wait. This was going to take a lot of patience so we waited and waited; when we finally got on and off we realized it was worth it. Then we got on a lot of rides, but the best one was the disaster-themed one. When we got back to the van we all said it was fun. Then I realized I had been very patient throughout the entire day, and it made the experience much more enjoyable."
1525	19514	7	3	One day me and my friend were going on a trip to Alabama. It was the most boring car ride ever! Imagine just driving in a car for twelve hours, just driving and stopping to use the bathroom. And to make matters worse, I had the smallest bladder there, which as I can imagine was quite a challenge! But we did get to count Waffle Houses because the farther south you go the more people like waffles. I’m not kidding, there was at least one Waffle House every few miles. And a kind of funny thing was we weren’t just going to Alabama, we were going to the very bottom of Alabama. So when we finally crossed the state line, we still had to wait two more hours. But when we finally got there we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from the experience: long car rides don’t bother us as much anymore, having built up our patience on that long journey.
1526	19515	7	3	I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient. My younger cousin was at my house and needed help on his math homework. Because no one else was home, I had to be the one to help him. We sat together on the living room couch and I began to help him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn’t know how to do any of it, not even the simplest problems. So I had to sit there and carefully teach him how to do each step, and then explain the process of how I got to the correct answer. And did I mention that he had three full pages to complete? It was a long and repetitive process, taking almost two hours before we were finally done with it all. And that was a time when I truly had to be patient.
1527	19516	7	3	My father has recently lost his job. It has been a hard time for our family. It has been exactly three months since my father has had a job. During this period, my father has been constantly applying for jobs online and sending out resumes. But he didn't give up. He kept on trying and trying, week after week. Fortunately, my father has a job interview in San Francisco in a couple of weeks, and he is going. Hopefully he will get the job. Thankfully, my father has been very patient throughout this entire ordeal. Even though he is being rejected constantly, he still tries very hard to get a job and remains hopeful. My father is my role model because of his amazing level of patience. Thank god, I have someone to care for me who is as patient as my father. Without the patience of my father, our family could not live with such stability. Well, job or no job, I will always love my father. This would be true because of my father's great level of patience. For that main reason, that is why my dad will always be my hero and number one beloved role model.
1528	19517	7	3	"Patience is a very difficult thing for some people to master. One time I was at a huge family party with many guests. But none of my friends or my cousins were there, so I had no one my age to talk to. I was bored the whole time, just watching the adults talk. I asked my mom if we could go home early, but she said ""no"" and told me we had to stay. Then I sat down on a chair in the corner and I waited and waited for a really long time, trying to entertain myself. Then finally, after what felt like hours, we went home. The next day, as a reward, my mom sent me over to my cousin's house for a sleepover. This was because I was being patient at the party and did not complain further. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You receive good things when you choose to be patient."
1529	19518	7	3	"Melay was a little girl, waiting for her parents in the dense bush. She didn’t know why she had to wait there. Her parents seemed distressed all the time now. ""It must be something I did,"" she thought. Her sister was not as patient as Melay was waiting. Her sister had to be doing something all the time and could not sit still. So when her parents didn’t come and somebody else did, she wasn't happy. Some boys came walking along the road where they were hiding, carrying rifles. Melay was thinking, “these are boys waiting along the street. Are they crazy!” If their parents told them to hide, it was always for a good reason. She sat there thinking about this when she heard a loud crack! ""What was that?"" she thought. She looked to where her sister was supposed to be and she wasn't there. ""Where was she?"" As she looked out to where the boy soldiers were standing around laughing. ""What were they laughing at?"" Melay looked closer and saw that it was her sister. ""No!"" she cried out. ""Where are my parents, they should be here by now,"" she thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. That's when she saw another two mangled and depleted bodies. She found out that it was her parents. She started running, running away from the tragedy. She made it about a mile before she had to hide. She hid in a thick bush. The boy soldiers were walking around looking for her. Suddenly one cried out, ""There she is!"" They dragged her out of the bush, and walked for what seemed to be forever. Finally they reached a building. Melay was screaming at herself, ""If only I had waited. If only I had waited."" They took her into a room and the boss raped her, then they quickly shot her to death and dragged her into a dumpster. If only she had waited."
1530	19519	7	3	I remember this hot summer day I was on my way to the dentist. I left school because it was the second to last day, and I left school about forty-five minutes early. My appointment was at four-thirty. So I arrived at the dentist's office at about four-fifteen. There was about four people ahead of me in the waiting room. So I waited patiently. And four-thirty passed, so I went across the street and ordered a small drink. After finishing my drink, I bought some gum from a store, and it was now five o'clock on the dot. I'm still waiting, so I go and ask the front desk manager how long it will be until I go in. She said she would go check for me. She came back and she told me I can go right on in. I felt so happy for myself for being so patient and not complaining, and I even got a toothbrush for being patient!
1531	19520	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at three o'clock, but my dad gets home from work at six. So, if I wanted his help, I would have to wait patiently by myself, even though I didn’t understand the assignment. I would put the homework that needed help back in my backpack until my dad got home, and I wished I only had homework that didn’t need help on. After I finished the homework that I could do on my own, like all my math problems, then it was time to eat dinner. As I ate my dinner, I would watch the clock. By that time I was done waiting, and my dad was finally home, ready to help me. We would sit together after dinner, and he would help me understand the difficult subjects so much more, making the long wait worthwhile.
1532	19521	7	3	Once there was a lonely puppy who felt very sad with no one to play with. One day he decided to send a letter to a random address and then he waited and waited and waited for a reply. A few weeks later, to his great joy, he got a reply to his letter, and it was from another puppy who was also looking for a friend! They soon became best friends, writing to each other often and sharing stories. The puppy learned that patience pays off, usually when you least expect it. The two friends were never lonely again, and the first puppy was very glad he had been so patient.
1533	19522	7	3	On a cool October evening my friend Sarah and I climbed on the bus headed for the Halloween event at the big amusement park. Sarah and I were with our church group, and we were all together till one in the morning. We had been riding all different rides all day and we finally got in line for the biggest roller coaster. The sign out front said the wait from this point was two hours, but we were determined to wait it out. I was around eight o'clock then so that would put us on the ride around ten. We soon found out that the park also started a fireworks show at nine, and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around nine-thirty all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade to pass the time. About every five minutes we would hear loud, obnoxious screams from the haunted house, and we always heard feet running like they were in a race. Then at about ten o'clock we finally got on the ride, and we all loved the thrilling drop. When we got off someone suggested we go on the spinning ride, and all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats from a nearby stand and could almost taste an elephant ear on my tongue. Little did we know that we would have to walk through the clown carnival to get there. It was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures, which was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the ride entrance there was a giant line, but it was only going to take forty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting it on the head rest so many times during the spins. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky attractions we had missed. We found out later that we had waited in line for a total of five hours for all the rides that night. We finally got on the bus, tired but happy, and headed home. That day I truly learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did.
1534	19523	7	3	A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to the beach, really it had only been about a month since we booked the trip. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient and let the days pass. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a whole month to go to the beach was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest of all. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all, just thinking about the ocean. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling that it was finally time. Finally we loaded up the car and left for our destination. We drove our car there so it took almost two long days. But it was worth it, the beach was really fun and pretty, with soft sand and big waves. We also went to the boardwalk amusement park and had an awesome time on the rides. I had to be patient at the amusement park since there were long lines for the popular rides, so we had to wait a while for each one. I had a really fun time on my vacation, and the patience I practiced made the trip even sweeter.
1535	19524	7	3	Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life, and I have to use it everyday, especially for basketball practice. There could be a lot of different reasons that someone would need to be patient. Well, I have three reasons in particular that test my patience. My first one is when people don’t pay attention during drills. It frustrates me a lot. When the team members goof off, our coach gets mad. She will either tell us to knock it off or she will make us run a couple of laps around the entire gym. My first reason leads directly to my second. The second thing that irks me is that when people don’t pay attention, they get lost in the play and have no clue what is going on during the game. There is a lot of people who take a long time to catch on to new strategies. My second reason leads to my third. My third is when somebody new joins the team and we have to start from the beginning. We just had two new people join the other day and the season is half over already. The newest member of the team can not make a shot to save her life. She doesn’t put all of her effort into it, which is hard to watch. There is only like two out of ten or twelve people on the team that is actually good at shooting. Looking over my thoughts, all of this is stuff I have to be patient about. If I wasn’t patient, I would be in trouble with the coach and it would mean I would have bad sportsmanship, which is important. I deal with it and put up with all of this though, because I love the game. Over the years I have learned a lot about patience from basketball. I learned how to be patient with others and with myself. I’m glad I know how to be patient now or else where would I be? Probably not on any teams or in any clubs, and I would have missed out on a lot of fun.
1536	19525	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just sit there waiting on the doctor to call my name. The chairs were stiff and the air felt still. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady hadn't called my name yet, after waiting like twenty minutes, I just turned my music player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine. The soft melodies and the colorful pages helped the time pass more quickly. Before I knew it the nurse called my name, “James,” she said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room she directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going on I thought to myself “maybe being patient isn’t that bad after all!”
1537	19526	7	3	Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital. The waiting can seem to stretch on forever. What I do to pass time when I’m at the doctors is play I spy. I play it with my mom every single time we find ourselves in that situation. There is usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go, which gives us plenty of things to spot. There is magazines but I think they are boring, so they just sit on the table untouched. Therefore I play I spy to stay patient and keep my mind occupied. Otherwise I would be very, very bored, just staring at the clock on the wall.
1538	19527	7	3	Last year I had to go to the doctor on my birthday. So after I came home from school I left right back out, feeling a little disappointed. When we got there we had to wait in the lobby. There were crying babies every where, we still had to go to the movies, and shopping, and I could feel my special day slipping away. After what felt like an hour, there were still too many people in front of me. I started to get mad, tapping my foot impatiently. Finally, they called my name. I was so happy I didn’t know what to do, finally free to start celebrating.
1539	19528	7	3	A time when someone was patient was when a guy named Mr. Jenkins was driving and a little girl named Sarah was walking on the side walk and it was a red light. She yelled out loud “go old man!” The old man went and she followed him to the store and she asked what was that and Mr. Jenkins says that was nothing. “No you tried to hit me!” “No you were rushing me so I went,” he explained calmly. Sarah says to Mr. Jenkins I was losing my patience. Mr. Jenkins tells her “well learn how to control it then,” showing great restraint himself.
1540	19529	7	3	“Mom!” Lily whined, her voice escalating into a wail. “You can’t do this to me. I’m ten!” “Lily, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. But I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all summer. Your father and I have work honey!” “Mom can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about Emily? She babysitted last year!” Lily’s mother sighed. “I know you liked Emily, but she just wasn’t fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you said you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the daycare?” Lily used her well practiced glare at her mother that said “but if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the Fullers. Susan, Lily’s mother, was taking her to the county’s only day care, Sunny and Bright Daycare. The name made Lily want to gag. “Susan remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” she called as she started to pull out of the driveway. Lily turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “Sunny and Bright Daycare. A friendly and loving environment”. She had that gagging feeling again. She turned back to see if she could spot her mother’s red, battered, sedan speeding down the poorly paved road. But all she saw was a trail of dust. Great, she thought as she entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown. “Lily, why don’t you play with little Tommy?” Mrs. Adams said, comforting “little” Tommy in her arms, actually, Tommy was seven, which Lily thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “Lily we need to talk.” The middle aged woman, shunning Tommy to the side, said, “honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you as a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” Lily looked like she regretted yelling. She smiled and went to find Tommy. Maybe he’d still be game for Uno.
1541	19530	7	3	I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom could decide when I would finally get it. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school, but I was acting very patient and helpful so my mom would think it was finally the right time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasant little angel, cleaning my room without being asked. But she still didn’t say it was the time to get a phone. The next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but even better, offering to take out the trash. I still didn’t get it, and I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs from the frustration. The next day, @DATE1, I cooked my mom some breakfast, some scrambled eggs and toast, and I was satisfied that this was surely the day to get my phone. Nope, she just hugged me and thanked me with a knowing smirk on her face; she was waiting for me to burst out shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I just said you're welcome, although I was feeling intense disappointment inside. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am, so I dressed very professional-casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress. I ate, and I had walked to school feeling determined. My mom was up when I got home and she said, “@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something.” I smiled so hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out. I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friend's house, and I wondered why. My mom said, “wait @CAPS2,” me still wondering, watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I had left at my friend's house. I was so eager for a phone and now my smile turned into a fake smile of disappointment. We got home and I ran straight to my room, where I started doing my homework to distract myself. @DATE5 was the last day for the week. I didn’t do anything but mop all day, feeling a bit defeated. I was still being patient though, trying my best. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house, which helped pass the time. Finally, on @DATE4, my mom was up when I got up for school and she said, “@CAPS2, you can have your phone now.” I hugged her tight and ran out the door very eagerly to try it out, my patience finally rewarded.
1542	19533	7	3	A time when I was patient was on @CAPS1. I got to open our presents at nine thirty in the morning, but I had to wait and wait for my parents to wake up. So for two long hours I watched television, the time passing slowly. I thought @CAPS2 would be hard, but @CAPS4 I made it through without complaining. That @CAPS1 I thought was the funnest, @CAPS4 I lied, I think this year will be even better. That day I made breakfast in bed for everyone, carrying the tray carefully. I actually had a lot of fun doing it, cracking the eggs without making a mess. I got my mom a couple things of perfume, which she always likes. @CAPS4 of course she doesn’t use them often; I do, because I love the smell. I got her some candles as well, vanilla scented. We got my dad a bright orange sweat shirt, his favorite color. We also got him some @PERSON1, which he really enjoyed. It was a morning where my patience made the final celebration even sweeter.
1543	19534	7	3	One time me and my family were at @CAPS1 point over the @DATE1. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didn’t feel like it; I was too old for those. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there, a real thrill. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool with its loops and drops, so my dad and I ran over to the entrance, weaving through the crowd. But when we got there the wait time on the board said one hour and forty-five minutes, a very long time. I really wanted to go on this ride but it really wasn’t worth standing in that line for so long. So when the line started moving and we were half way there the signs still said @NUM1 minutes, not much progress. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day when it's less crowded. But my dad said that we’ll be through soon and he told me to just watch the people on it go by and not talk, to make the time pass. We moved up only a little more and the time was still at @NUM1 minutes, so my dad finally agreed and said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister by the merry-go-round.
1544	19535	7	3	I was patient once when my dad had said he was going to give me a letter every @DATE1 because he was too far away for me to visit; he lives all the way in @LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because I’m not really the patient type, I usually want things right away. I guess being patient is not all that hard once you get used to it. For me to be patient I have to be doing something, so I get myself to rest by writing stars in a notebook and drawing pictures, reading my favorite books, going to any area around my mother's house to help with our animals like feeding the chickens. And when he finally comes to visit, I didn’t even get the letter I was waiting for until later. Milk @DATE2 so I had to wait even longer, which was a test. Within I guess on it, that was the point to do; you just have to have your mind on other things and not just the one thing you have to be patient about, and that makes the waiting easier.
1545	19536	7	3	I was patient one time, really patient but it kinda went like this. It was @CAPS1 season and my mom and I went shopping for presents for the family. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into Target, the store brightly decorated. I already knew what I was going to get my brother, the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1; it was perfect for him. But my mom wouldn’t let me buy it just yet, saying it was too early, so I just bought him a Target gift card for @MONEY1 instead, slipping it into my wallet. I had to hide the card for almost a month, keeping it a secret under my socks, but I really wanted to know what my mom got for my brother and I, the mystery killing me. But she wouldn’t tell me no matter how I hinted, so I had to be patient and wait for the big day. And when @CAPS1 morning finally came I was so surprised because my mom had bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for me and my brother to share, her secret finally revealed.
1546	19537	7	3	Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient, he waited @NUM1 long months for the Xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. He quietly waited day after day for the game, checking the tracking information online and imagining the battles he would have. But one day after school it arrived, a brown cardboard box sitting on his doorstep that finally contained the prize for his long and patient wait, making all the anticipation completely worthwhile.
1547	19538	7	3	The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabbed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball she’ll just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited, not saying a word and keeping my hands at my sides. My sister ended up getting so bored she just dropped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames, having learned that sometimes patience is the easiest way to win.
1548	19539	7	3	When I had to go get my check up with my asthma or and a familiar way like that when I had been waiting in the waiting room which had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didn’t call your name yet. So I had gotten myself busy with crossword puzzles and looking at the fishes which were awesome cause they had different kinds of fish, like a bright yellow tang and a slow-moving catfish. And then mostly I had read my book cause I am a reader at the same time a writer but I mostly I had read my book when the doctor came in finally to call my name but I was still busy doing activities then he had said he was sorry about the wait which took a while and just said it had been fine and he seen all of the stuff I had been doing while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get good compliment which makes me feel really good with a smile on the face. And ever since I see that exact doctor who I had do appointment with he always give me a treat or stickers. But to me it doesn’t matter as long as I am treating other people fair usually great. Because people would love to be like you one day for having patience, and that feeling is its own best reward.
1549	19540	7	3	When my mom, @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was really fun. @CAPS1 because I wanted a lot of stuff that my family couldn’t afford, my mom was very patient. I guess she’s just naturally patient. I just don’t know how she does it. Anyway, throughout the entire store, it’s pretty big. It’s two stories tall! My mom a little angry with me because I kept on getting mad at her. @CAPS1 even though she got really angry with me, she tried to do her best to not show how angry she was in the store @CAPS1 by the time we got home I was so tired, I could’ve slept for a whole two to three days! We got everything that we needed that night when we went to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day we had to put up our night stands. @CAPS1 I really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed. @CAPS1 my mom said that he might not get to it that day. I was almost literally hounding my dad to put our bed. @CAPS1 when the time came, I was fed @CAPS1 my mom was mad at me cause I wanted to sleep in my bed that night, and she explained that sometimes you just have to wait patiently for things to happen.
1550	19541	7	3	A time when I was patient was when @DATE1 we drove to @LOCATION1. It was a long ride. It was long because he had a navigation that went the long way to six flag and to our hotel. I try not to complain and be patient because the ride was a daylong so that means sitting for almost a day! We were lost in @LOCATION1 for almost a hour going up and down looking for our cousin that were coming too. I had to search but there was no space to. I wanted to go outside and run, jump but I had to be patient. It was @NUM1 in the morning and I was tired. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking for ever! At the hotel I was unpacking my stuff and notice I was patient for almost a day which I though I would never be able to do in a car. That was the time I was being patient, and I felt proud of myself for managing the long journey so calmly.
1551	19542	7	3	"Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, sister, grandma, aunt, uncle, my @NUM1 year old niece, and my baby cousin. It was a fun family outing, and we enjoyed picking out pumpkins together. When we were done, we went to a restaurant to eat, looking forward to a nice meal. After @NUM2 minutes of waiting for the waitress, she comes over just to tell us she will be with us ""ì@CAPS1î in a moment. So we wait for half an hour just to put our drink orders in, feeling a bit forgotten. When we finally got to order our food, it took them an hour to bring it out, which tested our patience greatly. The entire experience was a lesson in enduring slow service without losing our composure."
1552	19543	7	3	I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that Father's Day morning in @DATE1, and I was so excited. I’m not a very patient person, so when it came to this, it was so hard to sit still and contain my anticipation. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard, but when she was finally in my arms, it was the most amazing feeling in my life. It’s always hard having to leave her when she’s calling your name; it’s like I want to cry from the sadness of parting. I don’t always get to come home to a little girl saying my name, but I love every minute I do. I always patiently wait to see her again, but it is hard if you know what I mean, as the distance makes the heart grow fonder yet more anxious for the next reunion.
1553	19544	7	3	"At the @CAPS1’s office, I had an @CAPS2 appointment scheduled. At the @CAPS2 office, I was waiting in the room for her to come back, sitting quietly. Then the @CAPS1 asked me questions and then my foster mom some questions as well. Then she left out of the room; she went and found the other @CAPS1 and talked to him privately for a few minutes. Then they came back together and said, ""@CAPS4 you. Here goes the papers you need,"" handing over a small stack. The foster mom said ok, ""@CAPS4 you,"" in return. Then the @CAPS1 said to me, “@CAPS4 you for being patient, @PERSON1. I appreciate that so much,” offering a warm smile. “@CAPS5 to I’ll see you guys next time, ok.” @CAPS5 we said “bye,” and then we left the office, the meeting concluded smoothly."
1554	19545	7	3	Patient people are the people that tolerate life well and handle delays without frustration. If you’re not patient, you won’t get through life very well. I learned this important lesson when I was little. There was this thing I wanted badly, and I was going to drive myself to get it, filled with excitement. But just before I got out the door, the phone rang sharply. My @CAPS2 picked up, saying, “@CAPS1, oh hi @PERSON1, no not busy, @CAPS6 did not! no!” and the conversation went on for so long, and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, my irritation growing. I finally burst out, unable to contain myself, “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “Hold on @PERSON1, I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and then walked away, leaving me fuming. That’s @CAPS4 why patience is important; losing it only makes situations worse.
1555	19546	7	3	In the @DATE1 time, my mom had planned a trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks, a vacation we all eagerly anticipated. We were on our way to the airport, and there was heavy traffic trying to work through the congestion, but we could not move quickly. So my mom started yelling from the driver's seat, frustrated by the delay, and I told her just to calm down and that we would make it in time. So finally we got to the airport after the stressful drive, and there were a lot of people everywhere, so we had to rush through the crowds to our gate. Finally we made it to the airport, and I taught my mom that sometimes you must be patient and you will get where you are going without unnecessary stress. So finally we made it to @LOCATION1, ready to enjoy our holiday.
1556	19547	7	3	"A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we were waiting I kept asking my mom ""when are we going, when are we going,"" over and over. When they finally said my name, I walked into the room feeling nervous. I asked if it was going to hurt and they reassured me, saying ""you won't feel a thing."" The doctor put a tube near my mouth and told me to close my eyes and breathe. Without even knowing, I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours, and when I woke up and wanted to get out of the chair they said ""no, no, no,"" so I sat and sat until fifteen minutes later when they finally let me out. I was all loopy and had to be put in a wheelchair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys and my mom gave me a wrestler action figure. When we were about to leave my mom talked to the doctor and they took forever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheelchair back and we were off. During the ride my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day because of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror but I did anyway and my face looked gross and puffy. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks so I was very thirsty. When she finally said I could eat I was so happy. I am still being patient because the doctor said that grown-up teeth would come in a few months but it has been two years and nothing, so I am disappointed. But now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get braces, which is gonna hurt really bad."
1557	19548	7	3	On a fine Tuesday morning, I was heading toward the dentist's office. I wasn't pleased at all. I didn't want the time to pass so we would get there, but it did. When we got inside, my mom went to the check-in line while I just sat down in the waiting room. When my mom got done she sat right next to me and we waited. And we waited and waited some more. We waited for about twenty long minutes until the dental assistant finally came and called us in. Right when we got into his office, a nurse came in and checked my temperature, heart beat, and other basic things. When she was done and left, we waited and waited again. We sat there for another ten minutes before the dentist himself came in. When he was finally done, we checked out and left, and thankfully I don't have to go there again for a long while.
1558	19549	7	3	When I was in the third grade, my class had to put a marble set up together. I went to put the marble set up in place and it broke, which was disappointing. After that, we went to the park for a field trip and I had to wait for the shuttle bus to arrive. After the shuttle came, we went to the ice skating rink and I had to wait in a long line of people. When we finally got to the front of the line, we paid for our admission and after that we went ice skating. That was all we did that day, and then we went back to the house. We tried to build our marble machine again, and after that was done we went inside the house to play after having been outside all day.
1559	19550	7	3	"My friend and I were waiting to go on a new ride at the theme park. The ride was called ""Shooting the Rapids."" Since it was a water ride, we wanted to go on it very much. We waited over two hours to go on it, and it was quite boring standing in the long line. After that long wait, we finally went on the ride. The course was a wild, twisting water path and it was really fun, making the wait feel worth it in the end."
1560	19553	7	3	One early morning in Boston, Massachusetts for a figure skating competition I had completed, I was waiting to hear if I made it to the final part of the event. It was seven in the morning when we left the rink to take a break. We went to get a bite to eat and then went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend Sarah was also in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the finals, but I didn't know if I would or not. After an endless wait, they were finally about to call out the numbers of the people who made it. I kept saying my assigned number over and over again in my head. They called Sarah’s number, and I felt a pang of hope. I kept waiting for my number to be called, but they never called it. I had not made it, and I was very disappointed, but I knew I couldn't do anything about it except try again next time.
1561	19554	7	3	Patience is a huge part of life to be successful. While you have problems and obstacles, having patience is what makes you a good person. To have patience it is essential to persevere and to get the job done, especially when it is a long process for which you might have to wait. For an example, I have to have patience all the time for activities like football, hockey, and all the active things I do; you simply have to have patience. As you know, adults probably have a lot more patience than teenagers like myself. Like if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day, it never does happen because I lack his level of calm. Now when I become more grown up and an adult, I’ll hopefully have way more patience and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also do have to say I’m getting better with patience, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about it, and hopefully when I’m a grown adult I’ll be able to have some good patience like my dad, which will help me in all aspects of my future life.
1562	19555	7	3	To be honest, I’m not a very patient person, but there was one time I was, though I don’t really know how I managed it. I was waiting in a long line to pay for some earphones that I absolutely loved; they were a brilliant blue, my favorite color. So I was waiting, and five minutes passed, then ten, then I completely lost track of time but I knew it was a very long time. Then the cashiers started having trouble with the registers, which made everything slower. So I waited longer and longer until some people from the back came out and were trying to fix the machine. Then I had to wait even longer, feeling my frustration grow. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour in total. I really loved those earphones, but as much as I wanted them, I just couldn’t wait any longer. I finally gave up and put the earphones aside on a nearby shelf and left the store in a huff. I was really mad that day, thinking I had missed my chance. Two weeks later, we came back to the same store, and luckily the blue earphones were still just where I had put them. Yesss!! I was so relieved and happy that my initial patience, though it had broken, had ultimately paid off in a roundabout way.
1563	19556	7	3	One day, my mom was really patient with me during a frustrating car ride. We were outside just talking to each other when my grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said “yes” right away. So I went inside and packed some things to take with me because they don’t have anything fun at their place. When we hopped in the car, turned on the radio, everything was all fine. It was fine for about five minutes until we saw that traffic was backed up in my subdivision. I was fine at first until I got a text saying my cousins were already over there. I was so mad, but my mom just kept her eyes calmly on the road. I kept on screaming and saying, “Mom, go faster!” but she simply ignored me. It was like my words went through one ear and out the other. Then I got another text saying they were gonna be playing football in like fifteen minutes. He asked me, “When are you gonna be here?” I said, “I don’t know,” and of course my brother was already over there because he had spent the night. It was a bad night for me knowing I was missing out. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but she didn’t listen. So then I decided I was going to ignore her back. That didn’t work because she wasn’t talking anyway. So I fell asleep around four o’clock. I thought I had gone to bed forever, but I woke up at five in the same exact spot in the traffic. I was devastated. I yelled out the window and said, “Why is this happening?” Then I went to bed again out of sheer boredom. When I was sleeping, I felt the car go faster as the traffic finally cleared, until we turned the corner and got stuck in another traffic jam. I asked my mom how much longer, but she didn’t reply. So I screamed it again and she finally yelled back, “We’re here!” I looked out the window and we were finally at my grandparents' house. And I got to play football after all. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house with her parents. I never found out why she was so quiet during the drive. Maybe she just wanted to see her mom and dad without any drama. That was the time I truly saw how patient my mom could be.
1564	19557	7	3	"Awhile back my friends and I made a backyard game called ""Sneak n go Seek"". I had just taken a great sniping position behind a large oak tree. I had a great angle in all but one direction, which made it a perfect spot. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, so usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about, as I soon discovered. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes, completely still, until I finally saw one of the people that were playing. I aimed my nerf weapon and fired, and according to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while longer before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my new partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and unfortunately got shot himself. He didn’t notice me when I quietly crawled away from him, so I was safe for the moment. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to hide and wait. I found one quick behind a thick bush. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes, feeling the time drag on. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. But when I finally got my weapon from the ground, the person was already gone. This made me pretty mad seeing how I waited so long and didn't have a single person left on my team. I got up and went looking for someone to recruit, losing my patience and getting increasingly frustrated. ""Is anyone even out here?"" I whispered to myself. ""Got you now!"" someone shouted from above. Then my friend jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he had been up there, watching me. He was waiting for me to get close enough to his tree to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one, teaching me a valuable lesson about the game."
1565	19558	7	3	One time I was getting a cool new video game; it was sooo awesome that I could hardly wait. And my mom said we would get it on Friday, which seemed so far away. It was a busy Monday and it was so hard for her to get off work early that week. And when she got home on Friday, she said we would go on Saturday instead. I was a little mad inside, but I tried not to show it. But hey, who cares about one more day? But yea, we finally got the game on the next Saturday as promised. I couldn’t believe I had been so patient and that my waiting had actually paid off in the end.
1566	19559	7	3	A patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events, soccer practice, friends' homes, and other places if I need to go there. Also she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never certain and is always kind when were sad or anry and takes lot of time to do stuff for us, like preparing our meals and making sure we have everything we need for the day. Also whenever were havinn trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year and thats not including additional things like gear, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour even has to driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer and basketball; she never rushes us and often waits in the car while we finish our activities. she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test she stayed with me for corily @NUM1 hours, patiently explaining the concepts until I understood them. Also whenever I do bad in school she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good, yet she never gets angry. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals, which requires extra effort and planning for her. in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know, always putting our needs before her own without complaint.
1567	19561	7	3	A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years, which involved organizing many events and meetings. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work, such as managing communications and member activities. But with either position, she wasnít earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job to help support our family. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things, spending hours each day searching and filling out applications. She couldnít find a job that was right for her, one that matched her skills and schedule. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job, and she remained hopeful throughout the process. She kept on looking and looking, month after month, without giving up. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people, which she finds very fulfilling. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didnít enjoy, but her patience allowed her to find the right fit.
1568	19562	7	3	I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. Theyíre so boring. Especially the @CAPS18 long weddings that take like two hours of people  just standing there on the after doing  nothing, listening to long vows and speeches. Iím not the most patient person, so thatís probably why I hate long wedding. Now that is one long ëstory about patience. ìDo we have to go?î I moaned to @CAPS4 mother, slumping in my seat. ì@CAPS1 its @PERSON1ís wedding and itís important, so we are going,î she replied firmly. ì@CAPS2.î I had to surrender as I put on @CAPS4 new dress, which was itchy, and got in the car. The wedding was all the wapin @LOCATION1. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam that stretched for miles. ì@CAPS3 on!î @CAPS4 sister yelled, hitting the dashboard. I just kept quiet, trying to distract myself by looking out the window. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed for construction, which was a complete surprise. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1, making slow progress. When we got a call from @CAPS4 grandma, her voice crackling through the speaker. ì@CAPS5?î @CAPS4 mom answered, her voice tense. ì@CAPS7 are you? The ceremony just ended,î Grandma said. ì@CAPS8. Thatís bad. Weíre in @LOCATION2, why? Has the reception @CAPS9 yet?î my mom asked, her shoulders slumping. ì@CAPS10, but Iím sure youíll make it in time to be there,î Grandma reassured us. ì@CAPS11. Thatís good. @CAPS12.î ì@CAPS12.î @CAPS13, as if on we, he reached the reception hall and we quickly parked. I was so happy to be there even if I do hate weddings, just to be out of the car. ì@CAPS14 you have @CAPS16?î @CAPS4 mom asked as we arrvied home later that evening. ì@CAPS16? I asked, confused for a moment.î @CAPS17, I guess I @CAPS14, even the car ride was kind of @CAPS16 because I didn't complain too much.î  ì@CAPS18? You tend not to be the patient type, so that's a surprise,î she said with a smile. ì@CAPS1î I said and I was proud of myself for managing to stay calm.
1569	19563	7	3	A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table, which sometimes took a long time. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale, which meant sitting at a small table for hours waiting for customers. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it, like old toys and clothes that nobody bought. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it, which was a big job that took us an entire weekend. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff, especially when children found toys they loved. we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale, talking to neighbors and meeting new people! I think that we did pretty god, especially for our first time organizing such an event. We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate, which was a little disappointing but we understood. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot, and it taught me the value of being patient and persistent.
