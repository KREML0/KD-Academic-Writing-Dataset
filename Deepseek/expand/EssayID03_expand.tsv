1	5978	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lack of information on where to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on where to go, leaving him vulnerable and ill-prepared for the journey ahead. Ultimately, these environmental shortcomings created significant obstacles for his travel.
2	5979	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the temperature was hot and made everything around him hot, “brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text states, “The sun was beginning to beat down”(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone on the road with none around him either, so until he passed out, no one could help him. “ and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’ but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The settings that the cyclist was riding in weren't good ones and so they negatively affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tired in the end, a direct result of the harsh and unforgiving landscape."
3	5980	3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven’t been out in ages. The old men apparently haven’t been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions, leading him astray. My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. “Yes, sir!” This experience shows the importance of relying on verified tools over potentially outdated local knowledge.
4	5981	3	3	I believe the features of the setting affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy; he took the old men's advice to take an hour off his time by taking a short cut. If he would have stayed true to the map he wouldn’t have almost died of heat, but his impatience got the best of him so he took the shortcut. After his experience he knew he has to stick to the map and not trust people who haven't seen changes in the last few years. This lesson was hard-learned through the difficulties he faced on the misguided route.
5	5982	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist because if the setting were different the story would not have made sense. The setting of the story is hot and dry with scattered ghost towns. When he reaches the first “town” he sees “One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule.” If the setting did not have the problem of no water, there would be no conflict in the story. In the story the speaker says “I was travling through the high deserts of California” that are very hot and dry, and he says this causes the problem of it being hot and dry. If the setting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn’t have as much of a problem needing water which would have made the story much less exciting, demonstrating how central the arid environment is to the narrative's conflict.
6	5983	3	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry, with the sun glaring relentlessly from a pale sky. Also, it was nearly deserted; almost all of the places he crossed were abandoned and silent. Other features of the setting were a ramshackle shed with a sagging roof, several rusty pumps that looked long unused, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest horse. These features give you an idea of how the cyclist feels, which is isolated and struggling against the harsh, unforgiving environment.
7	5984	3	3	The cyclist was riding through a town when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did, which led him to become lost. He found himself in a ghost town in the desert, surrounded by the skeletal remains of buildings. The silence was profound, broken only by the wind. In conclusion, the desert is hot and its deceptive emptiness can easily lead a traveler astray, turning a simple journey into a disorienting ordeal.
8	5985	3	3	The effects of the cyclist, if it does not change, could hurt a lot of people's feelings because they simply don't care about the cyclist. I'm one of them people who does not care about it, as it does not affect me or anyone I know. While it is a big deal to some people, some of them even blow stuff up over it, their passion seems distant. They are talking on TV and on the radio, making all these claims that I believe are made up. I don't believe it until I see it for myself. That issue is not for black people because it has not done anything for us. We really don't care about the effects of the cyclist, as it remains irrelevant to our daily lives and struggles.
9	5986	3	3	The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey, making it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride, so he gets very dehydrated and fatigued. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” highlighting his dire situation. As you can see, the setting, with its intense heat and scarcity of resources, makes this man’s bike ride very hard and potentially dangerous.
10	5987	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he encountered many tough conditions that made it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot, which makes travel very strenuous. For example, the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down,” and this heat makes any task difficult because the sun drains a person’s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long, so the cyclist had a hard time conserving his limited water supply. For instance, the man drank so much water he almost ran out, facing the threat of dehydration which can cause death. Ultimately, Joe Kurmaskie’s story represents how the specific, harsh conditions of a desert environment can profoundly affect a cyclist's journey and well-being.
11	5988	3	3	"The setting of the author's shortcut affected his performance and strength tremendously. Whether it was the hills, the oppressive heat, or the barren landscape, all three elements took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his critical lack of water further depleted his energy reserves as he pushed forward. The flat road he had hoped for was replaced by short, rolling hills that seemed to sap his remaining strength. The hills were a particularly tough challenge to pass since Joe was being drained of energy with every pedal stroke. He overcame this profound exhaustion when a building finally came into view, offering a beacon of hope. He wiped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirage and tried not to get too excited as he mustered what he believed was his last burst of energy to maneuver down the hill. Ultimately, the author overcame all the problems he faced even though the journey was incredibly difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggerate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" I believe that the author would agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly."
12	5989	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the hot, unforgiving desert, a landscape that presents unique and severe challenges. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him properly hydrated under the scorching sun. The longer he rides exposed to the hot sun, the more he sweats profusely, and the more likely he will become dangerously dehydrated, threatening his ability to continue. If he was riding in a different setting, such as in the rain or snow, the adverse conditions could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast or efficiently. This is why the environmental setting affects the cyclist's physical state and performance very much so, demonstrating the powerful influence of one's surroundings.
13	5990	3	3	"There were many features that affected the cyclist, such as the relentless heat and the critical lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story, trying to combat the conditions, and ends up only having a little water left, which heightened his anxiety. The statement, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" clearly shows he wasnít prepared with enough water for his entire trip to Yosemite. Without sufficient water, he could face severe health risks, or even die from the heat and dehydration. Another quote, ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke,"" powerfully states that he understood the grave danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water scarcity and extreme heat affected him throughout the story in a compounding manner; not having enough water could make him lose more sweat, and the intense heat is making him lose even more fluids, which can ultimately cause extreme heatstroke and collapse."
14	5991	3	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, shaping his emotional and physical journey. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road and encountered the big snake lying in the middle of it, the feature made him keep caution and feel very uneasy, heightening his sense of vulnerability. Furthermore, the vast, empty desert and the fact that there was nothing around gave the cyclist a profound feeling of abandonment and the fear that no help would be available for when he was in trouble. This isolation amplified the difficulty of his ride. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and realizes that people are there, offering a reprieve from his solitude and distress. In conclusion, the various features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride, from causing fear and loneliness to providing much-needed relief.
15	5992	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided with better information. The old cottagers had told him about a path they thought was right, but it turned out to be hard and did not get him to the right place, leading him astray. The challenging features of this new setting are described as a terrain where the ""flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" introducing a difficult and unexpected physical obstacle. This misleading advice and the resulting harsh landscape directly contributed to the cyclist's arduous and unnecessary ordeal, demonstrating how the environment can dictate the difficulty of a journey."
16	5993	3	3	In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because he sees the same setting, the desert, for several miles without any change. He has no cold water, as none of the fountains provided it, and the road has a lot of hills that demand constant physical exertion. The cyclist is profoundly affected by seeing the desert and no scenery changes for a while, a monotony that stretches for hours. When you look at the same barren scene for hours, you could start to get mentally tired and bored with everything, which causes him to become very drowsy and bored, sapping his concentration. Also, the cyclist had no water, and the lack of cold water made the situation worse. Having no water out in the desert under the scorching sun could quickly make you dehydrate and even faint, posing a serious risk to the journey. These environmental factors combine to create a challenging and hazardous experience for the cyclist, demonstrating the power of setting.
17	5994	3	3	Many different characteristics in a setting can determine the outcome of an event there. In the story, Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclist's journey was affected by a few weather-related things that created significant obstacles. The intense heat was an extreme thing that slowed him down and, in most cases, prevented him from reaching his maximum level of ability and speed. Also, the time of day in which this tale takes place, specifically the peak afternoon sun, greatly affects the cyclist by increasing his fatigue. Lastly, the type of road, which was rough and demanding, and the vast amount of ground that he has to cover afterward affects his overall performance and stamina. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey, as these elements directly influence the traveler's physical and mental state, shaping the entire experience.
18	5995	3	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways, creating a profound sense of isolation and physical challenge. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot under the relentless sun and is always in a state of constant thirst, with his water supply never feeling adequate. In addition to this, the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate and empty for miles on end. He finds nothing but old abandoned buildings that are crumbling and silent. He doesn't find anyone around him—no people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization to break the solitude. This causes him to feel a little unnerved, as if something happened to him, like an accident, nobody would know about it or find him for a long time. This feeling is especially prevalent when he becomes dehydrated and his strength begins to fail. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the harsh and lonely setting of the desert.
19	5996	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, primarily through the environmental demands. One way the setting affects the cyclist is that, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before due to the dry, hot air. For example, the text states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest because the body loses fluids rapidly through perspiration. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you physically and determine your needs for survival and comfort on the journey.
20	5997	3	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist, creating a series of frustrating obstacles throughout the journey. First, the cyclist followed the old codgers' advice on how to get to Yosemite National Park, but their directions were vague. Their advice was no use and didn't help her in the end, leading her astray. Next, at a hoped-for water stop, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thought was going to be a refreshing spring, dashing her hopes for a drink. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasn't helping her bike move better and required more effort to pedal. Lastly, ""tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” which startled her and slowed her progress significantly. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist by impeding her travel and adding to the difficulty of the trip."
21	5998	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that’s not empty or almost empty like a “ghost town” as the cyclist said, allowing him to properly plan his route and replenish his supplies. The rolling hills further complicated his journey by adding physical strain and slowing his progress, compounding the difficulties created by the arid environment and misleading guides. This combination of natural and informational obstacles created a significant challenge for his ride.
22	5999	3	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road. A strong headwind creates significant resistance, forcing him to exert more energy and slowing his pace considerably during a race. Furthermore, adhering to traffic laws by staying on the right side of the road is essential for his safety, but it can also place him closer to the rough shoulder and potential road debris. These factors, the weather and the rules of the road, are constant considerations that directly impact his speed and safety throughout the journey.
23	6000	3	3	“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had a rough setting between hazardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was extreme. Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he’d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster, as each potential source was either dry or inaccessible. He had survived and wouldn’t ever take shortcuts again, having learned a vital lesson about preparation and trusting unreliable information in a harsh landscape.
24	6001	3	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn’t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road. The desperate search for water in the abandoned settlement yielded only a foul, undrinkable liquid, deepening his plight. The deteriorated pavement outside the town, filled with potholes and cracks, forced him to reduce his speed to navigate safely, further delaying his escape from the parched and unforgiving environment. This series of setbacks highlights how the desolate setting directly impeded his progress and survival.
25	6002	3	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time getting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads, demanding constant shifts in effort and gearing. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road, which posed a danger of puncturing a tire or causing a fall. The intense heat, challenging terrain, and poor road infrastructure collectively made the journey an arduous test of his endurance."
26	6003	3	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men’s help, and doesn’t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seemed all correct, for his water supply was still in store, and the first landmark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next town he hits doesn’t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply, not even a functioning pump, and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn’t further, so he pressed on with a growing sense of unease. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming steep, dusty hills, the sun beating hotter—it really began to look like a desert after tumbleweeds even went past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated and his throat feeling like sandpaper. The next thing to come along is an old juice building, its faded sign a cruel joke that almost seemed to mock him for how he has no water. He keeps on, however, his determination waning with every pedal stroke, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The changing scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, to profound relief.
27	6004	3	3	Well, I would put it like this: the weather had everything to do with it because the hot weather makes you tired and upset and easy to anger. The relentless heat drains your energy and frays your nerves, so now it makes you upset and then stressed. This cycle of physical discomfort directly fuels emotional tension, creating a situation where stress becomes inevitable. Ultimately, the oppressive weather is the primary factor that initiates this difficult chain of feelings.
28	6005	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two ways. These ways are physical and mental. The physical ways that features affect a cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and winding, this could wear the cyclist out over many miles. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is too steep, burning the muscles in their legs. When it’s you against gravity, it can be exhausting. The temperature can also be a crucial factor in a cyclist's physical ability, as extreme heat leads to sweating and dehydration. Nobody wants to feel like they're in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist can also be affected mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a vast desert, the bicyclist instantaneously thinks “dehydration” and “death.” If some people see dead animals or bleached bones on the trail, they would think they could die there too. If they see vultures circling overhead, they would get afraid and think of death, but the worse thing of all is knowing all of these ominous signs are in the same place at the same time. This is how the setting profoundly affects cyclists on both a physical and a mental level.
29	6006	3	3	The settings of the story were grueling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him with an unforgiving intensity. The cyclist began to sweat profusely due to the oppressive heat and thus he drank just about all of his water, draining his bottles quickly. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, constant sweat, and the early stages of dehydration. The California desert is a grueling place to be, especially in the month of June when temperatures soar. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, which restored his strength before he would eventually continue his arduous way to Yosemite National Park.
30	6007	3	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite that would save him time. However, the affect later turned negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed, leading him astray. Another feature that affected him was the setting, which was a desert-like area of cracked earth and sparse vegetation. The intense heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, sapping his energy, and he also drank a lot of his precious water. This later resulted in him becoming dangerously dehydrated and desperate. A positive affect was when he finally found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself with cool water and got some new, more reliable directions for his journey.
31	6008	3	3	The features of this desert setting affect the cyclist in many ways. By common knowledge, a desert is hot and dry, leading to severe dehydration and an increased need for water. As his water supply runs low, his mouth becomes parched and dry. Furthermore, because he is in the desert, he encounters wild and sometimes dangerous animals, such as the ridiculously venomous diamondback snake mentioned in the story. Because of the extreme heat, he realizes he had a significant chance of dropping from heatstroke. The writer also described the desert as having short rolling hills and rough road ahead, a terrain that would inevitably wear the cyclist out. Because of this challenging terrain and climate, the cyclist's journey is profoundly affected.
32	6010	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One prominent example is the hot sun that was beating down on him, which made him very thirsty and accelerated his dehydration. Another significant feature is the rough road, whose uneven and demanding surface wore the cyclist out and made him profoundly tired. A final, poignant example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it; this sight tormented the cyclist and made him feel like giving up because he was so convinced he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.
33	6011	3	3	In the essay the author writes of the rough roads and the limits the cyclist had to overcome to reach his ultimate goal. The difficult terrain presented a constant physical challenge, testing his endurance and resolve with every mile. These obstacles were not merely physical but also mental, pushing the cyclist to his absolute limits as he persevered toward his destination. The journey through such a demanding landscape was a true testament to his determination. Ultimately, the narrative highlights how these hardships shaped his path to success.
34	6012	3	3	Understanding, realism, and mood are all reasons how setting affects the story. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good and more engaging for the reader. When you have a well-established setting it's more understandable what the characters are trying to do and the context of their actions. A good setting also makes the narrative more realistic, so when you read it you won't be thrown off by inconsistencies. The mood of the story sets it all off, because usually books have their ups and downs in tone and atmosphere. That is why the author carefully crafts the mood to enhance the overall impact of the setting.
35	6013	3	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated which could lead to a heatstroke. The quote, “I could drop from a heatstroke,” clearly shows that it was exceptionally hot out and he was feeling so bad that he feared collapsing from the intense heat. This physical distress directly resulted from the harsh, arid environment he was cycling through, highlighting the setting's powerful influence on his physical state. The threat of heatstroke was a constant and realistic danger in such conditions, significantly impacting his journey.
36	6014	3	3	"The terrain during the cyclist’s journey greatly affects him, shaping both his physical state and his mood. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing, allowing for an easy and pleasant ride. The author stated, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This shows that he was energized and happy, full of optimism for the trip ahead. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot and unforgiving. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, the arduous climbs draining his last reserves of strength, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, “sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn, a direct result of the brutal landscape. This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are included, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did by pushing through the pain to reach his destination."
37	6015	3	3	The features in the story have a great effect on the cyclist, testing his limits and resolve. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the intense, oppressive heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, offering some respite from the sun, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle and sapping his energy with every turn of the pedal. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the critical lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water, unaware of the scarcity to come. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, contaminated and unappealing, so the cyclist didn’t take any, leaving him dangerously dehydrated. The lack of water plus the relentless heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, a combined threat that pushed him to his absolute limit, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time, proving his resilience.
38	6016	3	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief, a full spectrum of human experience. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, which act as a catalyst for his emotional and physical trials. For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California, a location defined by its isolation and harsh climate. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better and far less perilous. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart, ensuring access to aid. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road, an unexpected hazard. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made, a moment of reflection on his path. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it, but the setting made this advice difficult to apply. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly, increasing his suffering. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip, arriving in better condition. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses, providing the context for his misadventures. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story to tell, underscoring how essential the challenging environment was to the narrative.
39	6017	3	3	The setting in the story changes many times, each transition marking a new phase in the cyclist's arduous trek. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees, a landscape that is green and seemingly forgiving. Then the cyclist arrives at a town, a brief interlude of civilization, before venturing forth again. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road, the environment becoming his primary adversary. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had, every ounce of his willpower, to get to a town where he could get something to drink, his focus narrowed to this single, vital goal. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one, proving that the landscape itself was the central antagonist of his experience.
40	6018	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit”, influencing his perceptions and his journey. It is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do, suggesting a quiet, almost deserted world. When he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart, his observations colored by the dilapidated surroundings. Then he leaves and see these wide bunch of hills, a vast and imposing landscape that stretches out before him, defining the next leg of his ride. In conclusion, the challenging nature of the settings he passes through highlights the difficulty of his undertaking, and I would never do all the riding he did, recognizing the immense effort it required.
41	6019	3	3	The setting profoundly affects the cyclist because he is alone in the vast desert with no water and doesn't know where he is going. The old men on the porch had given him wrong directions, and now he is hopelessly lost in the arid landscape. The relentless sun and the endless sand drain his energy, but the cyclist musters the will power to keep on moving. He finds help along the way when he encounters another old man who offers him directions. However, the cyclist, having learned from his earlier mistake, says he has a map to guide him instead. This moment represents a small but significant step toward self-reliance in the harsh environment.
42	6020	3	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He uses a desperate tone to describe how bad things are when he says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He describes in exhaustive detail how hard his journey is getting, painting a vivid picture of his struggle. He describes the intense heat in the desert of California, pedaling up, “one long, crippling hill.” The rough terrain did not make his ride easy at all. The combined factor of the oppressive weather, the relentless rolling hills, and the critical shortage of water take a heavy toll on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day with ample water, then he would have been perfectly fine, highlighting how the setting itself is his greatest adversary.
43	6021	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot, both physically and mentally. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat profusely and intensifies his thirst. The bumpy roads and steep hills strain his muscles and make him work harder with every turn of the pedals. The abandoned places and the sheer emptiness of the landscape make him lose hope, as there is no sign of aid or comfort. If faced with these formidable obstacles I would have been affected in the same way, experiencing both physical exhaustion and deep discouragement. As I believe any human would be, the cyclist's plight is a universal one, where the environment directly dictates the limits of human endurance and spirit.
44	6022	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly. The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out, draining her energy and resolve. The cyclist is going to the city of Yosemite but some guys gave her a shortcut that has proven treacherous. Through this shortcut are formidable hills, oppressive heat, and a critical lack of water. The author describes this by saying, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” The cyclist is excited that there is a building where she might get some water from, a potential oasis. Also, she wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and she is sweating, actively losing precious water from her body. Therefore, the physical features of the setting directly and powerfully affect the cyclist's physical state and her chances of success.
45	6023	3	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. The rider is cycling fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, exhaust his water supply, and causes diminishing hope. As he approaches small, seemingly deserted towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be incapable of giving him the relief he desperately needs. When he pumps out water that tastes like “battery acid,” his hope once again diminishes, as this essential resource is undrinkable. As he finally sees the bait and tackle shop in the distance, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover from his ordeal. These three interconnected features are what effects the cyclist the most, shaping his entire journey from start to finish.
46	6024	3	3	"In the story of ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. He was in the middle of the desert during the peak of summer and was dangerously low on water. The old men at the start of his journey had given him incorrect directions, and it seemed they believed he would not survive the harsh conditions. Although the cyclist ultimately survives the ordeal, the intense heat and the challenging season of his ride taught him a crucial lesson, and he will probably remember to bring another water bottle next time to be better prepared."
47	6025	3	3	Some of the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist, primarily through the difficult terrain. The road itself was in terrible condition, covered with bumps and ruts that made the ride much harder and drained a lot of his physical strength. Furthermore, the environment was brutally hot, with temperatures soaring to over one hundred degrees. This scorching heat was then compounded by the road's topography, which transitioned into a series of numerous hills, creating an exhausting and grueling journey for the cyclist as he struggled against the landscape.
48	6026	3	3	"In the story, many different settings affected the author in many different ways, each evoking a distinct emotional response. In the very beginning of his journey, he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope, noting, ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still held onto the hope that he would ultimately end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the road. He grew worried when he saw that no nearby town was still in sight, thinking, ""This sight was troubling."" When the features of the next setting caught his eye, he felt desperate and devastated, describing, ""At some point, tumbleweed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water; when he reached the abandoned factory, all his hope was lost and he was planning his death, thinking, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" However, when he finally reached the fish camp, he was immensely relieved, writing, ""I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them and buy some bait."" He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived the harrowing experience against all odds."
49	6027	3	3	"Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclist running low on water supply. In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,"" the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright seemed like a good thing, while his mood was still fresh and happy expressions played on his face. But as he moved on, he spoke of how ""The sun was beginning to beat down,"" expressing his remorse for listening to the old men who led him on their ""shortcut."" Along the road, he came to his first let-down, a ghost town with ""one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest male."" He tried to pump water from the corral but got a ""battery-acid"" flavor and was forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affected his mood, bringing pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end, he is profoundly relieved when he comes to the fish camp, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he ""had an overwhelming urge to seek out the proprietors, kiss them and buy some bait."" His thankfulness is expressed to men he does not even know, but they were the light at the end of his long, dark, and very exhausting tunnel, representing his salvation."
50	6028	3	3	"The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist throughout his difficult journey. It was hard for the author to arrive at the first town, as described in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The road the author was riding on was extremely rough. For example, the text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" The entire path was composed of hills and rough terrain, making the ride physically demanding. Furthermore, his situation was worsened by his dwindling water supply, as ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" The author did not have that much water left, which made the arduous journey through the challenging landscape truly difficult and tested his endurance to its limit."
51	6029	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would affect the cyclist would be the intense heat. Also, because of this factor, he is probably suffering from a lack of water. He is likely feeling extremely hot, seeing as he is the only one out in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles with no shade in sight. Another feature of the setting that would probably affect the cyclist is the constant thought that there might be a car around the next turn. If he cannot see what is coming around the next bend, he does not know what danger lies ahead. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up, as the isolation adds to his mental strain. These environmental challenges combine to make his journey a difficult and taxing experience.
52	6030	3	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist traveling through the high deserts of California in June. He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more, he drank water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, which offered little relief. The weather being so hot and humid did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. The fact that flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder and therefore use more of his dwindling energy. Luckily, the terrain had a positive effect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground helped keep his mind off his intense thirst for a short while. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure, shaping his difficult experience.
53	6031	3	3	The narration of “Rough Road Ahead” describes how a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite National Park, his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his desperate need for water. The text states, “I had been hitting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June.” To his disappointment, the truck stop’s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his consumption, only forcing him to look elsewhere to quench his thirst. Next, he experienced rolling hills, and by exercising more energy he made his way forward, still in need of water. His speed lost its quickness as thoughts of his crippling dehydration distracted him. He overcame his challenges, making his way to a bait shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his health and created an obstruction that nearly deterred him from his goal, testing his resolve to the very end.
54	6032	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the oppressive heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dangerously dehydrated. He kept drinking his water regularly, until he didn't have any left, which increased his anxiety. Another reason is because the flat road turned into hills, which made him use more energy and increased his fatigue. Finally, it did not help that he had not seen any sign of living creatures except for a single snake, which emphasized his profound isolation. These elements of the setting combined to create a very challenging and draining journey for the cyclist.
55	6033	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character, the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through the high desert of California in June. So naturally it can be inferred that it is hot and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases a tar-like substance followed by brackish water, he is running out of his precious water supply. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills, tumbleweeds, and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that he could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June. He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service, causing more anxiousness and despair. I have had an experience similar to this where I was out walking in a state park in the winter. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow-covered trees made me feel as if I would never be warm again, similar to the cyclist whose environment made him feel he would die of dehydration. So, as can be seen, the setting of this short story profoundly affects the cyclist and his state of mind.
56	6034	3	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don’t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn’t a cool breeze in the air in the June heat of California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the parks were and where civilization was too so he could get some water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” helped you realize that taking advice on direction from old people who don’t go anywhere is a bad idea. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows you some terrain features that affected the cyclist by making his journey more physically demanding. Furthermore, the cyclist relievingly found civilization with running water, which finally ended his ordeal.
57	6035	3	3	"In the story “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there are many things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"" because he did not want to get lost as he traveled through unfamiliar and other towns. The next example is when he came to a rock in the road and had to get water from an old rusted pump because he had really no water left in his water bottle, highlighting the constant challenges he faced. These obstacles were all part of the journey, each one a necessary trial to overcome before reaching his destination."
58	6036	3	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain; “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” this shows that he is warm and troubled by the change of the terrain. He also feels alone; “I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path” and he also thought he was in a ghost town. “Summer time rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying from the oppressive heat. He also thought he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was not seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes; the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things don’t look good, to keep moving forward, never look back and always be positive and take advantage of your surroundings. This is the message of perseverance and optimism the author tries to give to the reader."
59	6037	3	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickly in the relentless sun. It was also very dry and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was, with his throat feeling parched. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared and isolated in the vast emptiness. The story also mentions that he is in a ghost town, adding to his sense of desolation and abandonment in the harsh landscape.
60	6038	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the way that the author started talking and how he sounds at the beginning of the story. When they both look at the picture he looks like he is ceasing and then coos, adding to the story's disjointed feel as it continues. It doesn’t sound like he is enjoying his ride, because of the noise he was down on the bumpy roads, the sparks, and the bore of the country thirst he doesn’t have. He is acting time and sec from add person doesn’t mic at all because there could be old-timers who don’t know once you are tailoring around here, to save, to go shouldn’t take advice from them because you could end up like this in a transition, California doesn’t and how fierce how could now do it, to let some or therefore so be dehydrated, ultimately conveying a sense of confusion and hardship.
61	6039	3	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that affected the cyclist, primarily the environment he traveled through. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was, a dry and inhospitable region. When he tried a drop or two from a questionable source, it had the flavor of battery acid, making it completely undrinkable. He wasn't able to drink the water because the ""battery acid"" that was in it could have made him very sick, worsening his already difficult journey. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard, as indicated by a sign warning, 'Rough roads ahead'. To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do, requiring constant focus and physical effort to maintain control. So just these two examples, the undrinkable water and the rough roads, made the features of the setting definitely effect the cyclist, shaping his entire experience."
62	6040	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist throughout his arduous trip. At first the cyclist goes by a river, a source of fresh water which he won't find later in the journey, creating a sense of what he would soon lack. As he goes along in the journey the intense heat and the resulting lack of water starts to affect him, causing physical strain and dehydration. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with a flavor so bad it seemed the fountain had long since been shut down, offering no relief from his thirst. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting, from the initial promise of water to the harsh reality of the arid landscape, which together challenge his endurance at every turn.
63	6041	3	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist significantly because the roads are too rough and the available water is undrinkable. If he goes too fast over the broken pavement he could spin out of commission, risking a serious accident that would end his journey prematurely. The water was also a source of trouble, failing to provide the hydration he desperately needed. He said, “when I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of a battery acid,” which immediately prevented him from drinking it. These two major obstacles, the hazardous road conditions and the lack of potable water, directly impacted his ability to continue, demonstrating how the environment posed a constant challenge.
64	6042	3	3	The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water, which becomes the central conflict of his journey. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of his destination. He longs for, “the cool pines and rushing rivers…” which represent the relief he hopes to find. Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply, with the physical toll becoming increasingly severe. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him, a cruel reminder of his thirst. His destination finally fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey and its relentless tests of his endurance.
65	6043	3	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way, presenting multiple hardships that challenged his progress. The snakes blocked his pathways, creating dangerous obstacles that required careful navigation and heightened his anxiety. His short water supply made it hard to continue, as the relentless heat and physical exertion led to severe dehydration; he felt as if he could drop from a heatstroke. His environment, and the discouraging information from the old man he encountered about the difficult road ahead, made his ride very hard to continue, testing his mental resolve as well as his physical strength. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him, proving that the journey was as much about surviving the landscape as it was about covering the distance.
66	6044	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the road conditions. The road was all messed up, littered with potholes and broken asphalt that jolted his bike and made steering difficult. This rough and uneven surface forced him to slow his pace considerably, as navigating the hazards required intense concentration and effort. The physical strain of maintaining control on such a damaged path quickly led to fatigue. Ultimately, the cyclist's journey was severely hampered by the poor state of the roadway, demonstrating how a single element of the setting can create significant challenges.
67	6045	3	3	The cyclist was well prepared for his adventure, however, not enough for a change in scenery. When the old men told him to take a difficult path and he did, his entire setting changed for the worst. After this, he was nearly overpowered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not packed nearly enough water or supplies for a change such as that, and he would regret it later. The hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and merciless, making it even worse on him. His energy reserves dwindled with each arduous pedal stroke against the relentless incline. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist, transforming a manageable ride into a grueling test of endurance.
68	6046	3	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone; in this case, it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty hot outside, causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn’t much easier, demanding more physical exertion to traverse the uneven ground. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought to be a diamondback, forcing him to stop and cautiously navigate around the potential danger. These environmental factors collectively shaped the difficulty and pace of his journey.
69	6047	3	3	The features of setting really affect the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather: if it is hot, it will slow the person down, sapping their energy and requiring more frequent rests. And if it’s perfect, that will let the person go at a regular, steady speed. And the roads: if the road is bumpy, that will slow them down, causing discomfort and demanding greater physical control. And if it's smooth, that will speed them up, allowing for efficient and swift travel. See, a cyclist's progress and overall experience really does depend on the specific environmental conditions they encounter along the way.
70	6048	3	3	The setting affects the author a lot. First, he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out, and this intense heat makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do not help much in the vast, arid landscape. There is also nowhere to get water for a very long time. The narration states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie). With no water, the cyclist was dehydrated, and this hurt his biking skills like balance and leg strength. Finally, there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached his destination or water. There was also no one to help him if he were to have a heat stroke, leaving him completely isolated and vulnerable to the harsh elements. This profound solitude amplified the physical challenges posed by the desert environment.
71	6049	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled many miles on a bike dealing with the harsh weather in the deserts, the constant worry over his little bit of water, and the deep fatigue from being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another, with each element of the environment presenting a new challenge to his endurance and resolve, ultimately shaping the entire narrative of his difficult journey.
72	6050	3	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are exceptionally dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstroke. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not have drunk as often, and would not have faced the threat of dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toll on the author's body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph.” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind fixated on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the author's journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the profound isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, he was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue entirely on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the central conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not so hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting, in my opinion, would have ruined the story’s tension and core message.
73	6051	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had to be dry, old, and dirty. “… I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling.” When she wanted to use the rusty water pump, a foul, farlike substance oozed out and the water seemed to be extremely hot. “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike, demanding greater physical effort. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on, he was getting more tired and his water supply was going down rapidly. It was a trial for him to keep his balance while he kept riding over the challenging ground, each pedal stroke becoming a test of his diminishing strength and willpower.
74	6052	3	3	How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is, for one, that it is too dry; a cyclist would be ready for thirst and shouldn't be in a place that’s dry. Like in the story it says “I was travelling through the high parts of California in June,” meaning it was really hot and dry, which exacerbates the risk of dehydration. Second would be the animals there being dangerous. A cyclist should not be riding in a place with diamondback snakes; it says in the text “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path at a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like a diamondback,” which if it really was one would be really dangerous, and a cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are. That is how the settings of the surroundings effect the cyclist and how it is a bad place for them to ride, presenting multiple environmental hazards that threaten his safety.
75	6053	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as the ground would change terrain a lot, making it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way and forcing constant physical adjustments. Also, the severe lack of water made it hard to focus, clouding his mind with thirst. I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making the challenges seem worse than they actually are, as the isolation and harsh conditions can amplify perceived difficulties and wear down mental resilience, ultimately defining the struggle of the journey.
76	6054	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways, primarily through the intense heat and lack of resources. The weather is very hot and humid, which makes him sweat profusely, a process that uses up his energy as his body works to stay cool. Also, the setting affects the cyclist because there is no available water; so on top of sweating and being out of energy, he has no water to refuel his body. This severe dehydration makes it very hard for him to keep going, as his physical condition deteriorates without any means of replenishment. Ultimately, the harsh environmental conditions create a significant physical toll on the cyclist, threatening his ability to continue his journey.
77	6055	3	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California, a location that is naturally arid. This is a primary reason why he is very limited on his water supply from the start. It is really hot, which would cause him to drink a lot more water than usual, rapidly depleting his reserves. He had started his journey in the early morning so that the sun wasn’t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day, hoping to avoid the worst of the heat. Then it started to get a lot more sunny as the hours passed. So with the sun comes more heat, intensifying his struggle. The rider says, “The sun was beginning to beat down,” a statement that would help the readers realize what time of day it was and how intensely hot it was becoming. This was in the morning so he didn’t realize the full danger, but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated, his initial advantage lost to the relentless climb of the sun.
78	6056	3	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author, though the affect was bad rather that good, creating a series of hardships. First, there was the almost unbearable heat that dominated the landscape. The author had a limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoldering temperatures, which accelerated his consumption. Another feature that had a great impediance on the author’s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbled across at the snack stop, dashing his hopes for relief. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when the author tried to get water, making it completely undrinkable. There was also brackish water in the area that tasted suspiciously like battery acid, leaving him without a viable source of hydration. These environmental challenges collectively worsened his physical state and morale during the journey.
79	6057	3	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June, a time of peak heat. The author describes part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health and his situation. A little further into his journey he realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon, a thought that grows into a fear. The author writes, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,"" highlighting the severity of the threat. As the cyclist has run out of water and there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he might never make it through the desert to Yosemite National Park. The author describes this despair, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,"" a vivid image of his hopelessness. The setting of the cyclist's journey greatly affected how he perceived his journey, transforming it from a physical challenge into a fight for survival."
80	6058	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of where he is, which is isolated and desolate. The biker is in a campground in California, a location that, by his description, allows one to sense it is a dusty and dry place. Also, when the story says that the “town” had been abandoned, this also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a deserted place without many people or places to stop for aid. The story also talks about a snake in the road, an detail that reinforces the emptiness of the area. A snake in the road tells one that the town is deserted because, in populated areas, such wildlife is seldom seen on active streets. I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not go into towns that don't have buildings or activity. If a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are usually busy and have no snakes in the road, confirming the complete lack of human presence.
81	6059	3	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over the challenging, short rolling hills, and around a ridiculously large snake, which poses a physical obstacle. Furthermore, because the environment is intensely hot and arid, he could suffer from heatstroke at any minute, making his journey perilous. So yes, the author is affected by the setting, as these elements directly shape his physical experience and mental state.
82	6060	3	3	The effects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes, so the bikers need water to stay hydrated and also it affects them by the roads being so hilly so they can’t just ride straight. They need to go over the hills and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land from a jump, requiring significant physical effort and concentration to navigate the uneven terrain safely.
83	6061	3	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something to look forward to, but the features of the setting that he is immersed in to get there cause him despair. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices the sweltering heat of the sun during the early endeavors of the trip he checks himself up as he says, ""I barely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the warning with the hope and beauty of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticed the sun the more he drank until his water supply seemed low; stopping at an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, sun and tumbleweeds did nothing to quench the cyclist's thirst or at least divert his attention. If the cyclist was to see a sign that said Yosemite a few miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more purposefully laid out, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tone of this passage would be more hopeful; instead, in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."
84	6062	3	3	The bike rider in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is greatly affected by the condition of the land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running dangerously low on water. However, since it is such a dry place he can’t find any source to refill his bottles. Also, since it is out in the middle of nowhere, there is no one he can ask for some help or supplies. If this story was set somewhere else, like a lush, populated area, he wouldn’t have had either of these critical problems, highlighting how the setting dictates his struggle.
85	6063	3	3	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area that feels hot in your imagination. For example, in paragraph five they use a lot of adjectives to describe how abandoned the place was, using words like ramshackle and rusty to paint a picture of decay. Also, how often the lack of water was brought up made us think of how hot this California desert must have been, creating a sense of persistent thirst. The intense heat even made the cyclist believe he was seeing a miracle when he saw the vision of the Welch’s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are specifically chosen to describe the harsh environmental features that affected the cyclist's perception and physical state."
86	6064	3	3	In the passage, the cyclist encountered about two distinct settings that challenged him profoundly. One of these settings was the rough terrains he had to pass through, where he suffered from a severe lack of water, leaving him parched and weary. Another setting the cyclist had to endure was the hill-like terrains, steep and exhausting climbs where he found himself laughing at his own folly for taking the old men's advice in the first place. Both of these environmental features had a great and taxing toll on the cyclist's body strength and his spirit, draining his energy and testing his resolve. But with unwavering confidence, sheer determination, and the sweet relief of anticipated success, he was ultimately able to overcome the formidable obstacles in his path.
87	6065	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, shaping his difficult journey through a harsh landscape. For example, the weather in California in June was intensely hot, and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was scalding hot, as well, offering no refreshment. The text says, “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This affected him critically because he had no cool water to drink from, intensifying his dehydration. Another example is when he had to overcome physical barriers like tumbleweeds and snakes, which posed direct threats. The text states, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This was a dangerous obstacle that he had to navigate carefully. Another example is the profound isolation he experienced, as he was utterly deserted. The text says, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” emphasizing his solitude and the psychological challenge of the empty expanse. These combined elements of the setting created a multifaceted trial for the cyclist, testing his endurance on every front.
88	6066	3	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist's journey is crucial, as extreme conditions directly impact his performance and well-being. If it’s too hot, the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster, his energy sapped by the relentless heat. And if it’s too cold then the cyclist would likely be get sick, facing the added hardship of illness. Also if it’s too windy then he would go a lot slower, especially if he is going in the wind’s direction, fighting against an invisible force that drains his momentum. Each of these environmental factors presents a distinct challenge that the cyclist must account for, demonstrating how deeply his progress is tied to the whims of the weather. Ultimately, the setting's features are not just a backdrop but active elements that dictate the pace and difficulty of his ride.
89	6067	3	3	The features that affected the cyclist were plenty of things, each adding a layer of difficulty to his arduous trek. One significant thing would be the crippling lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid, making it undrinkable and worsening his thirst. Another one would be how all the surroundings changed from what the old men said, and because of this he got lost, finding himself in an unfamiliar and disorienting landscape. When he was lost he had to have immense determination to find someone or some sign that he could survive, pushing forward through doubt and fear. These challenges, from physical deprivation to mental disorientation, tested his limits but also highlighted the inner resilience required to persevere. In the end, it was this perseverance that guided him through the ordeal.
90	6068	3	3	The setting and its features affect the cyclist greatly, compounding the difficulties of his journey through a desolate area. He is in the desert and all the towns are abandoned, offering no refuge or supplies. Also he now hits a sign that says “Rough Road Ahead” (kurmaskie, pg 4). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads that jolt his body and strain his bicycle. And he has the sun beating down relentlessly and is almost out of water, a combination that pushes him to the brink of his endurance. The unforgiving environment, marked by isolation, poor terrain, and extreme heat, creates a formidable adversary that the cyclist must struggle against with every ounce of his strength. Despite these overwhelming features, his journey continues, a testament to his will to move forward.
91	6069	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills; he would have to slow down so he could maneuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The intense heat he was facing would cause extreme tiredness and severe dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a painful sunburn or suffer a dangerous heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with pre-existing heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal if not addressed promptly. If the cyclist does not see any buildings or landmarks, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost in such an environment will also inevitably lead to further dehydration, exhaustion, and an increased risk of heat stroke, creating a perilous cycle.
92	6070	3	3	The setting and its features affect the cyclist profoundly because with each building he passes, he hopes for water and shelter, but since he is traveling through a vast desert, water is in extremely limited supply and many empty, dilapidated buildings are left out in the wasteland. These abandoned structures create a fleeting feeling of relief in the cyclist, only to be followed immediately by crushing despair upon finding them empty and useless. The barren land with no distinct features also creates a deep feeling of lost hope in the rider, making his entire physical ordeal that much harder psychologically. Over all it was an excruciatingly difficult experience, both physicly and mentaly for the cyclists as the landscape constantly challenged his spirit.
93	6071	3	3	In 'Roughing It Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist’s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in “the high deserts of California in June,” the climate is relentlessly hot, dry, and miserable, sapping his strength. Another critical feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is out in the middle of nowhere, completely isolated. There are no other human beings, cars, or buildings for miles, intensifying his solitude. Also, the rough terrain significantly affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it demands more effort, causing him to exhaust his precious water supply even faster as he struggles onward. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his harsh and unforgiving surroundings, which test his limits at every turn.
94	6072	3	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways, primarily through the scarcity of resources. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story, a constant source of anxiety. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” There was a severely limited amount of water in the bottles, forcing him to ration carefully. He had to travel a long and arduous distance, noting “Not two miles into the next section” as a measure of his slow progress. He was getting tired quick, his energy fading. Also the terrain was not good for cycling. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” It got harder and harder to continue his ride as the landscape became more demanding, compounding his physical struggle.
95	6073	3	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw only dirt, snakes, and no source of civilization, it deeply worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did not see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same monotonous rusty color of dirt and the occasional threatening snake. His mood was adversely affected and he started to lose confidence and hope in his journey. He wasn't used to the new, harsh surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught by its desolation. Fortunately, he did find a semblance of civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits and provided a crucial respite. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he was alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down to gather his strength before wading out again in search of his final destination.
96	6074	3	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He’s in California in June, and it’s very hot, with a relentless sun beating down upon the arid landscape. It’s pretty much a desert, a vast expanse of dry earth and scrub. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops, which are warm and unsatisfying. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid, leaving a harsh, chemical aftertaste in his mouth. So this is not very good for the cyclist, as the harsh environment presents a significant challenge to his journey.
97	6075	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the “reservoir campground” he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving “the serenity of an early-summer evening and he’s headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one, filled with natural beauty and comfort. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the men's advice, sensing the growing desolation. However, he’s still optimistic, finally finding it funny that it was once “a thriving little spot,” a stark contrast to its current state. Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral” he knows that things are in bad shape and he desperately needs water. However, all they have is a “tar-like substance” so he moves on, having no choice but to continue his arduous trek. When he comes to the “rough road, tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake” it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through the adversity. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist, feeling the full weight of his predicament. Finally, at the end the cyclist enters a “rather modern bathroom” and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better, having successfully navigated the harsh and unforgiving landscape.
98	6076	3	3	There are several features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a profound lack of water, he is in the middle of nowhere, and nobody is there to offer assistance. Due to the lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist profoundly. He will need water in order to move and get through his journey, as it is essential for his stamina. Water is the main thing he should have to sustain his energy. He could end up getting severely dehydrated and it might cause him to collapse right in the middle of the street, a dangerous situation. Therefore water is one feature that critically affects the cyclist. Furthermore he is in the middle of nowhere, a remote and isolated area. There are no buildings or anything around, not even gas stations, so there is nowhere he can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about two or three bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks to replenish himself. That is another feature that will significantly affect him. Lastly nobody is around in the area to help him out or offer any aid. Let’s say that he gets lost and he will need direction to get wherever he is going; well, there is nobody around to help him get around or provide guidance. In conclusion those are the several main features that will definitely affect the cyclist throughout his difficult and lonely journey.
99	6077	3	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery and not only on the pain they are having, which provides a mental distraction. Also, if the setting is not very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery, making the journey feel longer and more arduous. Another thing is if the setting is very hilly and the rider has to drive over it, it would not feel the greatest, adding physical strain. The cyclist would get even more pain than before, plus the cyclist could get dehydrated faster from the increased exertion. The setting, with all its physical and visual characteristics, really does affect the cyclist's overall experience and endurance.
100	6078	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June, a time of intense heat and dryness. The cyclist also had a severe lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid, which was completely undrinkable. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions, which were confusing and seemingly unreliable. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map, deciding to rely on his own resources to navigate the challenging terrain and reach his destination.
101	6079	3	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist, primarily influencing his emotional state. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” This profound isolation made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory."" This discovery made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited, only to be met with further disappointment. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP.” The sight of this building, suggesting a possible source of aid, gave the cyclist a renewed sense of hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. Ultimately, the setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings, dictating his swings between despair and optimism."
102	6080	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he expected, presenting a series of physical challenges. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth, allowing for easier progress. Halfway through his trip the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist continues to pedal even though he was slowed down to 12 mph, demonstrating his determination. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the increased effort required to climb each incline. Towards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over one long, crippling hill.” The word “crippling” is used to show the physical affect that the hill had on him, suggesting exhaustion and strain. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more physically demanding, testing his endurance to its limits.
103	6081	3	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cyclist, creating obstacles during his journey. For example, the rough road posed a significant challenge, jostling the bike and rider. Another example is the tumble weed, which rolled across the path and could have caused a loss of control, and the snake also affected the cyclist, introducing an element of sudden danger and requiring evasive action. Each of these environmental elements presented a unique difficulty that the cyclist had to navigate. In conclusion, those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist, shaping his experience through both the terrain and the wildlife he encounters.
104	6082	3	3	The sun, the amount of miles, and the people are all reasons why the setting affects the cyclist, impacting him both physically and mentally. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot, adding to his physical discomfort. Also, he said that he really didn’t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist, suggesting a subconscious drain on his morale. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept giving him distances that seemed to stretch on endlessly, creating a psychological burden. These factors combined to make his journey more arduous, demonstrating how the environment can wear down a traveler's resolve over a long distance.
105	6083	3	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him, creating a landscape of profound isolation. This makes him more worried because if he dies no one will know for days or weeks probably, compounding his anxiety with the fear of disappearing without a trace in the vast, empty terrain. The complete absence of any sign of life or aid turns the environment into a silent, threatening presence. This overwhelming solitude and the associated risks are central to understanding the cyclist's precarious situation and his growing sense of vulnerability.
106	6084	3	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them significantly affected his journey. For example, the phrase “several rusty bumps,” quoted from the text, explains that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground but was instead navigating rough, hard, and bumpy terrain. This uneven surface made the ride physically jarring and difficult to manage. Also, he had a huge lack of water; he was severely water depleted, which sapped his energy to the point that he couldn't even go the speed limit. He was going only 12 mph, a pace far slower than the potential 55 mph he could have been traveling. The sign stating, “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” is another quote expressing the specific dangers in the ride that he was risking by merely being on that path. All these things combined made the cyclist profoundly uncomfortable, dangerously dehydrated, and very tired by the end of his arduous trip.
107	6085	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a very large factor of the story and was actually the cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout his ordeal. First, it started off with the large, steep hills he had to ride up, making him work much harder and tire himself out quickly from the constant exertion. Next, the big problem was the oppressive heat of June, as indicated by the quote, “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because…” The heat was so severe because it made him overheat, thus rapidly depleting his critical water supply, which he needed to survive, and it presented the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the sight of the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. The text describes, “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” In the unbearable heat with no water left and who knows how many miles left to cycle, this image really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, therefore, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements but also from man-made reminders that seemed meant purely to taunt him for his suffering.
108	6086	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place you are riding through is dry, abandoned, quiet, intensely hot, and relentlessly straight forward. The text tells you that the setting is abandoned when it says, “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This description of complete isolation would make it incredibly hard for a cyclist because you need a consistent and good water supply, and that is hard to maintain when there is nothing and no one around for miles. The barren landscape offers no respite or resources, turning the journey into a solitary struggle against the elements."
109	6087	3	3	The cyclist chose to take an old abandoned route to his destination. The route had, in some places, no buildings at all to be seen, making the cyclist lose hope of finding his desperately needed water. From the beginning until the end, there was no one else on the route, making him completely alone and isolated. So if something were to happen, such as an accident or illness, who would know or be there to help? During his adventure, he ran out of water, making him dehydrated, a condition that certainly didn’t help his deteriorating physical state. The setting of the story, with its isolation and lack of resources, seems truly tragic for the cyclist, emphasizing his vulnerability and the harshness of his chosen path.
110	6088	3	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much throughout his journey. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” The hot, relentless sun was making the cyclist sweat profusely, causing him to lose precious bodily water. This was making him become dehydrated faster, weakening his stamina. Furthermore, the text states, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" The hills the cyclist had to ride up were physically demanding, wearing him out more quickly and causing him to become tired faster from the constant climbing. However, a moment of relief came when the text notes, “I stumbled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink."" This modern bathroom provided access to good, cold water. This allowed the cyclist to drink from it and replenish his fluids. The water revitalized the cyclist, allowing him to regain some of his lost strength and continue on his way, demonstrating how a single feature in the setting could provide a crucial, life-saving reprieve."
111	6089	3	3	In the essay “DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,” it is a clear cut fight for survival as it seems that this man is fighting desperately to stay alive. As I know, cyclists often pedal for hours at a time and sometimes for hundreds of miles; if he was biking where green grass and cool mountains collide, the tone and mood of the essay would have been completely different. He uses vivid sentences such as “...of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.” THESE DETAILS all make me want to read further in the essay to see if he will be okay by the end of his harrowing journey. I know what the feeling is when you are low on fluids because I have chronic dehydration. I couldn’t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumble weed, with no relief in sight. It sounds like an awful, draining experience. If he were somewhere cooler and more colorful, his experience wouldn't have been so horrific, proving how deeply the setting influenced his ordeal.
112	6090	3	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One significant way is highlighted in the story when it describes that it was very hot; this intense heat meant he could become severely dehydrated and could possibly have suffered a heat stroke. Furthermore, the roads were described as windy, which presented another major challenge. This could be a serious problem because if he is already tired and fatigued, he might not be able to navigate the sharp turns properly. He might just keep going straight and then get lost even more, exacerbating his dire situation. That is all about how the various challenging features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist in the story and his struggle for survival.
113	6091	3	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" significantly affect the cyclist and his difficult journey. First of all, the extreme weather causes most of his pressing problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a California desert in June, the temperature had to be in the high NUM1's. This intense, relentless heat causes him to become dangerously dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly."" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drink his water excessively and run out of his vital supply far too quickly. Also, the objects the cyclist comes across on his journey affect him directly. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This obstacle saves the biker's progress and most likely scared him, adding to his mental strain. The cyclist is greatly affected by the various harsh features in the story setting, each posing a unique threat."
114	6092	3	3	The cyclist was profoundly affected by the oppressive heat of his environment. The fact that it was June, that he was in the desert, and that he was running low on water were the key factors that almost lead to his own down fall. This incredibly hot desert setting sounds utterly hostile and unforgiving, and I’m genuinely surprised he lived through such an ordeal and that he was that lucky to survive. His experience underscores the life-threatening nature of the landscape he traversed.
115	6093	3	3	The features of the setting had initially misled the cyclist, creating a false sense of security. When he had first left the town where the old men advised him, the cyclist had high hopes as he looked at the scenery and enjoyed seeing very little sign of the impending struggle. This early part of the journey, with its more benign appearance, contrasted sharply with the severe challenges he would soon face, showing how the setting's deception played a role in his plight.
116	6094	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way, creating a profoundly difficult journey for him. He began to lose hope, grew increasingly tired, and began to think he was going to die under the relentless conditions. The settings played the biggest role in this decline. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him for respite. He had very little water in his possession and no place to get anymore, a fact that weighed heavily on his mind. He then encountered a large snake, which made the situation worse because he was suddenly in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he met earlier, he likely would not have had this problem. Ultimately, the setting around him really made his trip a hard one, defined by the complete absence of water, people, towns, or buildings to offer any relief or safety.
117	6095	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” greatly affected the cyclist, dictating the emotional arc of his experience. In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities, a feeling mirrored by his surroundings. He states, “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the initial setting supported this feeling, as he notes, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" However, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed drastically. He was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared on his route, he sank deeper into despair. He recalls, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around, and because of this harsh and lonely setting he lost all hope of surviving. He became convinced he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremely hot sun. The cyclist was profoundly affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then finally to relief; the distinct changes in setting directly caused his change in attitude throughout this arduous journey."
118	6096	3	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist in major ways, primarily by deepening his sense of desperation. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is painfully reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, “…A young man pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head” (Kurmaskie). This advertisement serves as a cruel contrast to his own parched state. The text later states, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (Kurmaskie), a detail which tells that the cyclist feels depressed and is majorly affected by these desolate sights. This encounter with the barren landscape and the mocking advertisement could and would later ruin his self esteem and make him think about dying, as the setting systematically strips away his morale."
119	6097	3	3	The cyclist went on a rough journey, and he was explaining how tiring and difficult it was for him going from town to town. He had to deal with a severe lack of water, which was a constant source of anxiety. Furthermore, he faced the danger of poisonous snakes on the lonely road, adding a layer of fear to his exhaustion. The condition of the road itself also presented a significant challenge, making his travel even more arduous. All of these elements combined to create an overwhelmingly harsh experience for the cyclist, testing his physical and mental limits throughout his trek.
120	6098	3	3	The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey, instead presenting a series of discouraging obstacles. There were not many structures on the way to offer shelter or assistance. Either that, or the towns he came across were said to be “a ghost town,” which couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey, a fact underscored when the author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month, so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. All this must have taken a toll on his morale and physical state because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting, with its heat and desolation, definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels throughout the difficult trip.
121	6099	3	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resene when it @CAPS1 the signs that said “Rough @CAPS2 ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” That had to slow down his bike, forcing him to navigate the uneven terrain with greater caution and physical effort. “Then he said that their were no building or cars nowhere,” a description which underscores the profound isolation of the location. This complete absence of any signs of life or potential aid intensified his vulnerability, making the journey through the desolate landscape a solitary and demanding trial. The setting, therefore, directly shaped his experience by imposing physical challenges and a deep sense of solitude.
122	6100	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.” This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way, as the desolation contradicts expectations of a populated route. In the essay, it states, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn’t had in the larger mule greeted me.” This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades, reinforcing the eerie and abandoned atmosphere. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome, if they over fear the journey and turned “old timers” who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things. Ultimately, the setting acts as a powerful antagonist, testing the cyclist's resolve and perception of safety.
123	6101	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the first “toun”. The setting of the desert affected the cyclist because the cyclist was arising doun the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and he feared that he might drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentleman who were it been off their rockers, claiming to be tough. The harsh, arid environment directly contributed to his physical depletion and the poor judgment that led him astray. This my response to the features of the setting affected the cyclist, illustrating how the desert's brutality was a central factor in his ordeal.
124	6102	3	3	The cyclist trusted a man that didn't know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast, misjudging the distance and the harshness of the route. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasn't anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tired and dehydrated, the vast, empty landscape amplifying his sense of desperation. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the “@CAPS1 Juice” company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no, his pride and frustration now overshadowing his earlier need for guidance, a change brought on by the taxing journey.
125	6103	3	3	"During the passage “Do not exceed speed limit”, the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in “The high deserts of California in June”. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable, with the scorching sun beating down relentlessly. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual, sapping his strength with every mile. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says “over one long, crippling hill,” This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up, adding a grueling physical challenge to his journey. And finally, the author says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand, leaving him entirely to his own devices. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way, each feature of the environment conspiring against his progress and well-being."
126	6104	3	3	It affects the cyclist because in the beginning the text talks about the old man. It also talks about basically saying their information is out of date, also in other words he should have just followed his own map in the first place. The cyclist's journey is shaped by this initial dismissal of local advice, leading to a series of difficulties that could have been avoided. This realization comes too late, as the physical challenges of the ride are compounded by the mental regret of ignoring a potentially valuable warning. Ultimately, the experience teaches a lesson about the importance of preparation and respecting local knowledge, even when it seems outdated or irrelevant at the outset.
127	6105	3	3	"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change, with some good effects and some harsh effects. The first setting that is described is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of where the cyclist is heading and also establishes a happy, expectant sort of mood. Yet the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further into the cyclist's ride he noticed a change of terrain, as ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" At this point the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tired. Seeing this difficult landscape just crushes his spirit. Riding hills is hard, but riding hills without knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side is even harder. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have an easy, enjoyable bike ride, but this all changes when he hits those horrible hills. Just the thought of having to ride over miles of hills makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting supposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward of a beautiful place, creating a narrative of struggle and potential redemption."
128	6106	3	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot, which is clearly shown in the narration that states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” This intense dehydration caused him to drink water until he ran out, a situation described when the narration states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” In a state of desperation, he then had to suck on pebbles to stimulate saliva, an action which he acknowledged he could have choked on. The narration confirms this danger, stating, “With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This sequence of events illustrates how the harsh setting directly led to a physically perilous situation for the cyclist, pushing him to the brink of his endurance.
129	6107	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced by the author was the lack of water, which became apparent when he tried to pump some: “I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t calm down nor I tried a drip or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” When the cyclist set out for the next stretch of his journey, he came to a road that read “Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The terrain got more bumpy and hard to cross, which affected the determination the cyclist had left. He then regretted not listening to the old men, as he didn’t think they knew what they were talking about due to the fact they never left their porches. As you can see, the setting most definitely effected the cyclist in both physical and mental ways, challenging his body and his preconceived notions about the local advice he had received.
130	6108	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in several distinct ways. One way it affects the cyclist is by being intensely hot, as the text states: ""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June."" This extreme heat poses a direct threat to his health and stamina. Another way it affects the cyclist is by being bumpy and difficult to traverse, like it says in the text with the road sign: ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" This rough terrain challenges his physical endurance and control over his bicycle. Together, these environmental factors create a journey that is both physically demanding and hazardous, demonstrating how the setting directly influences the cyclist's experience and safety throughout his ride."
131	6109	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by influencing the mood of the cyclist and what happens as he journeys through the desert toward a town. For example, his mood changes significantly when an old man asks him for a map, and his attitude shifts from a cautiousness of the new road he was on, then to terror when he thought he was going to die, as he thinks, “I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean,” and finally to a sense of pride when the old man asks for the map and the author states, “I own a very good map.” But as he journeys to Yosemite, the setting itself changes when he travels through a desert-type place and then stops at a bait shop to rest, before probably continuing on his merry way to his final destination. The evolving landscape directly mirrors the internal shifts in his emotional state throughout the trip.
132	6110	3	3	Joe Kurmaskie's 'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit' demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle, a mode of travel that demanded significant physical exertion. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus, a lot less energy would have been used up, making the journey far less strenuous. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water, a critical situation in the arid environment. This setting didn’t help because they were on a bike, which increased their need to stay hydrated under the relentless sun. Another setting that affected the plot was the presence of deserted towns along the route. If they hadn’t been deserted, everything would have been better, as the cyclist could have found supplies and respite. Ultimately, these environmental features affected the cyclist a great deal, shaping the entire challenging experience.
133	6111	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist such that it was affecting his determination to continue. For example, after many miles he looked upon the “ramshackled shed, several rusty bumps and the corral… This sight troubled me.” In the desert, his water tasted like the flavor of “battery acid,” a detail that highlights the harshness of his surroundings. It also goes on to say that the journey was a “test for my inner spirit,” pushing him to his mental and physical limits. It also states that he went along with only a few drops of water through the fields of tumbleweeds, a vivid image of his scarcity. This passage shows the numerous obstacles he had to go through, which he did overcome, and he made it with a little confidence restored. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable, he still kept striving on, demonstrating resilience against the oppressive setting.
134	6112	3	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist throughout most of the narrative. The intense heat made him hot and thirsty, while the arduous travel gave him a profound lack of energy and created a desperate need for water. In one paragraph the writer says one of the hills was “long and arduous,” a description that underscores the physical challenge. The hill was wearing him out and draining what was left of his energy, leaving him exhausted. The setting of the story was the biggest factor in his struggle; the road was not flat but bumpy, and the temperature was extreme. These difficult conditions worked in concert to challenge his endurance at every turn of his journey.
135	6113	3	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways throughout his journey. The area in which the cyclist was traveling seemed to be abandoned, which doesn’t give a well-thinking feeling to this person, creating a sense of isolation. If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then there won’t be any noticeable building structures for a while, cutting off potential aid. Also, the layout and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist, not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the local wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamondback snake, poisonous, was directly in front of the cyclist, a immediate physical threat. That example explains how the wildlife might extend to more dangerous creatures, increasing the peril. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold, meant the cyclist was limited in water, and being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for him. The combined conditions of the setting the cyclist was in became a significant disadvantage for his progress and safety.
136	6114	3	3	The different settings that the cyclist had to navigate were challenging mountains or hills, steep winding roads, and the vast, arid California desert in June. As well as he was running out of water, the intense heat and isolation compounded his physical struggle, making each terrain a significant test of his endurance and will. The cumulative effect of these harsh environments created a journey defined by relentless difficulty and a constant battle against the elements.
137	6115	3	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting is a central point. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay, such as swapping the order of the desert and mountain sections. So I think they should change it around to better illustrate the progression of challenges, as the core idea of a difficult journey would remain effectively communicated through the adjusted sequence of environmental obstacles.
138	6116	3	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of California in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast and physically draining. At one point he says, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.” Furthermore, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beginning to run out of water. The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” When you're pedaling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you, primarily dehydration and exhaustion. If he was in a different setting this feeling of despair would not be present in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist, by shaping his physical state and mental outlook throughout the arduous journey.
139	6117	3	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die, just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you go there are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed, for instance by avoiding snakes on a desert path. It’s better to know the area and feel safe, then not knowing what’s going to happen next, as this awareness directly impacts his security and peace of mind during the ride.
140	6118	3	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist. At first the cyclist started off pretty easy. He had flat, smooth roads to go through. He started out before the sun could get to him. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him. Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder. “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So he had to pedal harder and it would tire him faster. “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state was difficult.” By the tumble weeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time. So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated. This was a hard task for him to overcome. By the terrain changing it become harder for him, demonstrating how each new environmental feature introduced a fresh physical challenge to his journey.
141	6119	3	3	The setting in this short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is a hot, sunny desert, in which all towns have been abandoned. “The sun was beginning to beat down” as the cyclist embarked on his journey. When he arrived at the first town, it fit the definition of a ghost town perfectly, with its silent, skeletal structures standing stark against the barren landscape. The cyclist at this point is not only tired but also increasingly worried about the lack of water, a concern that grows with every mile. The harsh setting and the cyclist’s deteriorating state run side by side, each amplifying the severity of the other in this desolate environment.
142	6120	3	3	In the story there are many effects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish the arduous race. The cyclist had to watch out for a rough road he was going over, its potholes and cracks threatening to throw him from his bike. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamondback snakes, their coiled forms a potential danger on the sun-baked asphalt. However, the cyclist's biggest problem throughout the entire race was water. He ran out quickly, his supply proving woefully inadequate. When he saw the factory and stopped, he was so desperate that he put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water and to let his saliva circulate. The cyclist had to go through all these problems, which ultimately made it show that he possessed immense determination to persevere.
143	6121	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding along on a route he had little confidence would end up anywhere, a path that seemed to lead only into more emptiness. That being the first time ever being on that road and having only out-of-date knowledge about it made the cyclist rethink his entire plan. The temperature was very hot, there was little shade, and the sun was beating down on him relentlessly. The route was very discouraging. All the cyclist wanted was water and the route kept taunting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get from it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that proved to be an old bottling factory for Welch’s grape juice. Time and again, the cyclist would appear to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing but dust and disappointment.
144	6122	3	3	During the cyclist's bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude. When he first starts, the reader can sense his frustration because of the old-timers and their vague directions. Then as he begins his journey and realizes that he might not have enough water, his attitude changes to one of concern. The cyclist goes from frustrated to briefly loving the scenery, thinking, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” but this hope is short-lived as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up, his spirit broken by the relentless environment. Until he got a second wind of courage, he continued on, “slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” When he finally saw Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he realized he was safe at last, his arduous journey finally over.
145	6123	3	3	The bicyclist from “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” was affected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the critical lack of water. The bicyclist felt he was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated, his throat parched and his body weakening. Another dominant feature was the oppressive heat. It was really hot where the narrator was bicycling. When it is that hot, the heat dehydrates you rapidly. So the narrator was being pushed to his physical limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was haunting him with its emptiness until he got mad at the lodgers he had talked to and was really frustrated by their poor advice. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it significantly harder for him to ride, sapping his remaining energy. Lastly, the snake in the road affected him because he had to swerve to avoid it. All of these environmental things combined to test his endurance and will to continue.
146	6124	3	3	“Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the barren landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from a California June, but not none the less oppressive. Then next come the rolling hills and the steep incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working harder, and burning calories and depleting his much needed water supply. Then there is the man's mental torture. A speed limit of sixty-five, where he is going a tough twelve. And worse a billboard of “a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding, from the heat to the hills, contributed to his profound sense of hopelessness and struggle.
147	6125	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly. For one, the conditions of the road were awful, cracked and uneven from the harsh sun. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path, a coiled menace on the asphalt, as well as the occasional tumbleweed drifting ominously across his path. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the critical lack of water combined with the unbearable, shimmering heat, and he was deeply tired, his energy sapped. Those are the powerful affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist, creating a journey of immense difficulty.
148	6126	3	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or Vermont, it would be a no-brainer to bike in Vermont. The temperature in Vermont would be much cooler and more temperate than the scorching heat in California. In the story the cyclist complains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" on his clothes and the very real possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water and essential salts from your body. Had the cyclist chosen a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled so severely with dehydration on his bike ride, making for a much more pleasant and safer journey."
149	6127	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot, shaping his entire experience. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination, full of optimism. Although it took him forty miles to get to the first “town,” he didn’t seem to mind at first. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” is what crossed his mind before the sun began to beat down in earnest. Meaning that he didn’t mind or wasn't particularly troubled by the distance at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter it became, and the less water supply he had left in his bottles. Once he passed a couple of “troubling sights,” because they were abandoned and no one was around to help, he began to worry in earnest. The cyclist got to the point that he started to suck on pebbles, in a desperate order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him the strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND SONS FISH CAMP, his emotions, and mind changed from being lugubrious, to becoming thankful and profoundly relieved for the respite.
150	6128	3	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems directly related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dangerously dehydrated, and describes, “the sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Another struggle for him was crossing the path of a “ridiculously large snake” and then trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated and weakened state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme, unrelenting heat, and upon finally reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and “in the neighborhood of zoo degrees,” or scalding hot. Another setting-related issue for Kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed completely deserted and he had to continue for many more miles until he was able to find a spot with clean, cool water where he could finally rest and properly rehydrate his exhausted body.
151	6129	3	3	The features of the setting were very affective in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to rolling hills. That’s going to be hard to pedal a bike on, requiring immense physical effort and draining his energy. Another way the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If they get caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him, creating a dangerous obstacle. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and things like that, jolting his bike and making the journey uncomfortable and unstable. Therefore, the setting was significantly affecting the cyclist throughout his challenging ride.
152	6130	3	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he realizes its hopeless. He was laughing when people told him the right directions and now “It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self,” said the cyclist when he was referring back to the first town. The reason this affects the cyclist is at first he was going good, feeling confident and energetic on his journey. Then he got thirsty and bad things happened, like his water supply running low and his strength fading, which shifted his mood from optimism to despair. This progression from hope to hopelessness shows how the journey's conditions gradually wore him down, and that is how it affected the cyclist.
153	6131	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills, which posed a significant physical challenge to his progress. The speed limit affected the author because he felt that he was moving too slow, especially when compared to the pace of the cars on the road. In the story when it says “I was doing a water-depleting fifteen,” is evidence of this, indicating that his slow, arduous pace was also rapidly consuming his vital water supply. This combination of terrain and regulation directly impacted his physical state and his perception of the journey.
154	6132	3	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a foreign-like substance which he could not drink from the well, as it was dry or inaccessible. The water bottle only contained a few tantalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst, leaving him parched and desperate. The hot heat that would make birds pick him dry; all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timer’s advice. It made him realize that in time comes wisdom and youth can make silly mistakes, like underestimating the desert. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive, testing his mental fortitude. That is how the setting effects the cyclist.
155	6133	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn’t have much water to drink, and the relentless heat and lack of resources created a constant state of physical strain and dehydration. The isolation and harsh environmental conditions compounded his difficulties, making the simple act of cycling a formidable challenge for survival.
156	6134	3	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist, shaping his journey through hope and disappointment. Several main features include the cars leading to a town that isn't really a town anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could have given him water, but it was all run down and weakened. He reflects, “I arrived at the first ‘town’. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.” He is saying that the town could’ve given him more water and energy, but it appeared that it was over for this town, offering only a hollow promise. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed, a potential oasis. He tried to pump water but got no success, noting, “I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t cool down.” A working water pump would’ve been huge for him, giving him more strength to bike and revitalizing his spirits. However, once again it was very misleading, leaving him as parched as before. These encounters consistently presented the illusion of aid while providing no tangible relief for his arduous journey.
157	6135	3	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, primarily through physical challenge and environmental conditions. One example is “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills, demanding greater physical exertion. Another example would be “high deserts of California in June.” That’s saying its hot outside and very tiring, creating a harsh and draining atmosphere. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the “summer time” its very tiring, exacerbating his fatigue and thirst. The terrain and climate thus work in concert to intensify the difficulty of his ride. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, defining the struggle of his journey.
158	6136	3	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made, directly influencing his speed and effort. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster, gaining a welcome respite. Conversely, the road might be up the hill so he would have to go slow, straining his muscles and consuming his energy. There could be a possibility that the road might have bumpy rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through, jolting his body and demanding constant vigilance. Each type of surface presents a different kind of obstacle, from smooth sailing to grueling climbs. So the affect on the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made, with every mile presenting a new physical test that dictates the pace and nature of his travel.
159	6137	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water, intensifying his thirst. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. When I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when it gets hot, creating a landscape of aridity. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his surroundings making him want water desperately. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth, a cruel mirage. This image probably made the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink, taunting him with what he lacked. These environmental cues constantly remind him of his dehydration, making his need for water all-consuming.
160	6138	3	3	In “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist was effected by the features of the setting, which guided and challenged her journey. She was first effected by the old men which told her a “shortcut” to her ride to Yosemite National Park, setting her on a difficult path. Then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her, dashing her hopes for replenishment. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by, presenting both physical and psychological obstacles. Then at the end she came upon “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” where she decided to make decisions herself, taking control of her situation. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” which saved her from dehydration, providing the crucial aid she desperately needed to continue.
161	6139	3	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a desert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a desert. A crucial thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Another setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a desert traveling many miles, and this intense heat directly contributes to his rapid dehydration and physical exhaustion. Ultimately, the harsh desert environment and the scorching June heat combine to create a formidable challenge for the cyclist, testing his limits and will to continue.
162	6140	3	3	The settings of a cyclist affects the way a cyclist performs. If the weather is too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them, causing fatigue and sweat. If it's too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike itself has to be stable, and the terrain is a major factor. Riding on rough roads affects braking, speeding, and requires chains to be in good condition. Furthermore, the area where the cyclist rides sets the mood. If it's a nice scenery the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood, as opposed to the scenery being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it, where the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These types of things collectively help determine how settings can affect the cyclist, influencing both their physical performance and their mental state.
163	6141	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The oppressive desert climate bears down upon the cyclist. For example, the route he takes is not only isolated, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for a deadly risk of dehydration upon the cyclist. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live, pushing him to his physical limits. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he can restock on water and become hydrated once again. This relentless environment is the central conflict, shaping his struggle for survival and his ultimate resolve to persevere against the odds.
164	6142	3	3	Many different things affected the cyclist on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a “ghost town” where there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, the misleading directions he was given, and the critical lack of water. When the cyclist came across the bait shop he knew he was saved. He became rehydrated and wisely declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and the desperate need for water. His experience demonstrates how the setting was both an antagonist and a teacher, guiding his decisions by the end.
165	6143	3	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is dehydration. In the story about dehydration it says “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” A good effect on the cyclist was having no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad effect on him was that he learned not to ask for direction from a guy, as he reflects that ""heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't left their porch in a decade, caused me to laugh"". One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake. ""At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake--It really did look like a diamond back... Blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me"". These obstacles, from the climate to the wildlife, collectively shaped his difficult journey through the desert landscape."
166	6144	3	3	The cyclist, not knowing where he was going, received incorrect information and unfortunately followed it. He had initially been excited, believing he knew his destination. Along his arduous journey, he was affected by a number of environmental factors, such as the relentless sun. The summer weather conditions of his expedition and the large snake he encountered posed significant challenges. He was severely affected by the sun because he was dehydrating rapidly, and he almost had no water left. The increasing heat made the journey very difficult for him and made his mood strange and disoriented. While attempting to follow the direction, he was further disheartened by a big snake he encountered on the case, which startled him. He was scared that he was going to be attacked and had to cautiously make his way past it. These features affected him profoundly because he didn't know where he was going and he felt utterly lost. Consequently, he ended up going in the wrong direction, a situation for which he was not prepared, especially given the harsh summer weather. It was extremely hot, and he was riding a bicycle, not a car, which exposed him directly to the elements and intensified his struggle.
167	6145	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist and his train of thought, leading him into a spiral of despair. On page @NUM1 it says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This statement gives a strong sense of the oppressive heat and effectively foreshadows the critical lack of water he will experience later on. The environmental pressure continues as he passes a snake, noting he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” So the cyclist is most likely beginning to feel dizzy and weak, which causes him to start losing hope. On page @NUM2 he reveals his growing fear, saying, “I could drop from heatstroke,” meaning he’s starting to imagine the worst possible outcomes. This thought process affects him deeply because he’s beginning to lose faith and thinks he’s not going to make it to safety. On page @NUM3, his despair reaches its peak when he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” By this point, the harsh and unforgiving conditions he was enduring were profoundly rough and making him worry intensely about his survival. This progression clearly illustrates how the features of the setting affected the cyclist's mental state throughout the story.
168	6146	3	3	"With little water, the setting was distinctly unhelpful and actively hostile to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 emphasized the isolation, saying, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@PERSON1). After having received bad directions from a few old men, having people passing by in cars or nearby stores would probably have helped the cyclist immensely for asking for proper directions. The lack of resources is further highlighted when @PERSON1 described ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish one's body will inevitably lead to weakness and physical instability, which is a severe problem when one is in the middle of nowhere. @PERSON1 also noted the challenging terrain, stating, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@PERSON1). With little water left and a body growing progressively weaker, it must have been incredibly hard to navigate the physical exertion of going up and down those slopes. Furthermore, @PERSON1 also said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@PERSON1), which conjures images of dust filling one's lungs and the relentless heat from the sun, making it increasingly harder for the body to function properly under such duress."
169	6147	3	3	The setting in the story profoundly affected the cyclist, creating a formidable obstacle to his journey. The narrative takes place in June, a time when it is notoriously very hot, and as a result, the cyclist is getting dangerously dehydrated. One can vividly imagine how intensely hot it became when the text stated, “wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” illustrating both the physical discomfort and the mental fatigue induced by the heat. It also sounded in the story that the temperature felt unbearably high, as if it were two hundred degrees, with the sun beating down mercilessly upon him. This oppressive atmosphere directly contributed to his physical strain and growing sense of desperation, demonstrating the powerful influence of the environment on his experience.
170	6148	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways, compounding the difficulties of his journey. For example, it was June and he was cycling through the @CAPS1 of California, a region known for its extreme summer climate. It was very hot, and the heat rapidly dehydrated him, sapping his strength. Furthermore, he did not know where he was going, so he had to rely on directions from other people, which introduced an element of uncertainty and potential for error. The cumulative effect of the heat and his poor navigation meant he had to struggle constantly against dehydration and disorientation. These are the primary factors that negatively affected the cyclist throughout his challenging ordeal.
171	6149	3	3	The features of the settings in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through Todi, California, which is a rough and desolate area to ride. The ride was so hot and long that he was severely dehydrated, with dried sweat caking the skin around his neck. The solo cyclist emphasizes the isolation, saying, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He had nowhere to get water or food, as the landscape was completely deserted. He had the grim thought that if he died, no one would find him quickly, and the birds would pick his bones clean. Ultimately, the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Kurmaskie shows that a solo cyclist must be very independent and resilient.
172	6150	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles throughout his arduous journey. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park from a group of elder men he encountered, but the directions were based on their old memories and the information was sadly out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to make a critical decision when he came to a fork in the road, choosing the path the old men said would lead to a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into a series of challenges, from flat roads that eventually gave way to rolling hills, to snakes blocking his path, and finally a dangerous state of dehydration that could have killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame numerous physical and navigational obstacles to successfully reach his destination at Yosemite National Park.
173	6151	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all, he listened to the directions from an old man, which led him to be on the wrong and more difficult path. He travels through the hot June day in the California deserts, where the odds are against him from the very start. He describes his predicament, stating, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” From the angle of this description, you can tell that he is exhausted and almost out of water. This harsh environment puts a lot of strain on the cyclist, but he manages to persevere through the adversity.
174	6152	3	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist and the progression of his journey. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, providing a brief respite, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes significantly more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill..."" This shows that the hill is a very challenging and draining obstacle for him to overcome. He is also affected by the various things that come with the change in terrain, which highlight the remoteness. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This detail stresses how isolated the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how the setting mentally and physically impacts his entire trip, demanding constant vigilance and effort."
175	6153	3	3	The effect of the setting begins with two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert, men who had been there since Carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight, and the cyclist realized he had to travel many miles to get to the next town. So he gets on his bike and begins the long ride to the next town under the rising sun. The posted speed limit on the road is 55 miles per hour, but he was only going 12 miles per hour, his pace just like a slow water flow. He was riding up and down the rolling hills, feeling the strain of the continuous elevation changes. He finally got to the next town, achieving his goal and securing his chance to live and recover from the demanding trek.
176	6154	3	3	The setting of the essay affects the cyclist significantly because he becomes lost after asking for directions from a group of old people. Their instructions, which were likely confusing or inaccurate, lead him astray in an unfamiliar area. This pivotal moment, driven entirely by the setting's inhabitants, directly causes his subsequent disorientation and struggle to find his way, ultimately shaping the entire course of his difficult journey.
177	6155	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. In the essay, the author describes how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, and he is also running out of water from his thirst. The road gets very rocky at one point, which makes the cycling arduous. The narrator states, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), indicating a sudden change in the landscape's difficulty. There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is, providing visual proof of the challenging environment. It is barren with nothing around it, offering no relief or resources for the weary traveler.
178	6156	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is dehydrated and has to ride on horrible conditions of a road, with obstacles like snakes and hills. All of these features act like an obstacle course, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do, which is receive water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water, he at this point is delirious and most likely doesn’t know what’s going on. In the story, the author's main feature of the setting is the road, as indicated by the sign, “Rough road ahead.” This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that while dehydrated is very dangerous. These are some of the key features of the setting that negatively affect the cyclist and his physical state.
179	6157	3	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the “@CAPS1 town” he isn’t really worried; he is kind of laughing and thinks it's funny by saying, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war.” Then after he says that, it says he chuckled. When he gets to the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water, he begins to switch into conservation mode and begins to get scared. He says, “I would comer water- a test at my inner spirit,” this showing that he was scared. After he sees the abandoned Grape juice factory, he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind some expensive biking gear. This definitely shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these directions. When he finally reaches the bait shop he is relieved and goes to the bathroom and drinks water. He also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn’t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist, from his initial amusement to his final desperation and relief.
180	6158	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the features of the setting effect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, it might be necessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all; in fact, all it does is make the cyclist more exhausted and isolated. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" With more miles to go, the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" Although the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the repetitive nature of the hills. Many features of the story effected the mood and the physical state of the cyclist throughout his journey."
181	6159	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. It affected him because the sign was saying @NUM1 miles and then he was in the first town, thinking that he was getting excited and he was almost done, believing he was going at a fast pace. When the cyclist finally got to the first town, he said that it looked completely dead, with no signs of life. And then after he kept moving, he gradually began to understand that he wasn't getting anywhere. Then after some more thinking, he noticed with frustration that he had listened to some old folks who had never even been off their own porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first desolate town, he had known right then and there that he should never listen to old folks ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years, a lesson he would not soon forget.
182	6160	3	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park greatly affected the cyclist. On the long journey to the park, the cyclist had encountered the oppressive heat of the California desert. Besides the relentless heat, the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the short, rolling hills, which were deceptively challenging. This strenuous effort made the cyclist tired and weary, sapping his strength. Adding to his growing weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dangerously dehydrated. He noted, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This difficult trip through the harsh California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration, testing his limits.
183	6161	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be intensely hot, the road could be bumpy and difficult, and the town could be completely deserted. For example, a sign reading, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" would present a serious challenge for a cyclist who is already thirsty. And if he is thirsty and has no water, he would probably barely make it up the steep hills, his energy fading. And with no town available for getting water, his thirst would become overwhelming. The ""first town"" might have been a thriving little spot at one point, but another warning was that it fit the description of a ghost town's outskirts. With no water available there, his situation became truly dire."
184	6162	3	3	Hot conditions, a lack of water, and being lost—all are ways the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was incredibly hot. In one sentence he says the sun was beginning to beat down mercilessly. He also noted that the water in his bottle felt around two-hundred degrees, too hot to drink. That sweat was pouring all over him, so he had to be really suffering from the heat. Next, the critical lack of water affected him and his performance deeply. The reason was that he was dying in need of a drink. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water left, pushing his endurance. Lastly, he was completely lost, as the map that he had was wrong and the trip wasn't what he had expected. But in the end, he was relieved to have persevered. So even with all these negative effects, he still managed to come to a positive resolution. Basically, this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things, you are most likely to succeed in life and other endeavors you @MONTH1 take part in. So one should always try their best and make a way for their life and plans.
185	6163	3	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always either problems or helpers on his journey. Say there is a rocky up-hill part of the trail; that will most definitely slow him down significantly, requiring immense effort. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part immediately after, that will speed him up considerably and take a lot of the work of pedaling off his hands, providing a welcome respite. The terrain, therefore, directly dictates the rhythm and difficulty of his ride.
186	6164	3	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desert in June, a time of year known for its extreme, oppressive heat. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water, making it completely undrinkable and worsening his dire thirst. When he saw the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, he was very cautious, his spirits sinking further with each difficult pedal stroke. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there, his mind conjuring images of failure and defeat. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This profound isolation, combined with the harsh reality of the California desert, made him think he was going to die out there, completely alone and forgotten.
187	6165	3	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California, a journey that tested his physical and mental limits. In the essay, he describes the weather with “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” While this statement does not directly characterize the weather, the reader can confirm a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer, a heat that is relentless and draining. When the author comes across the “ghost town” followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read “Rough Road Ahead,” his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone, replaced by a deep-seated dread. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion, a fear that became increasingly real. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a powerful account of human vulnerability."
188	6166	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in that the exhaustion was getting to him, weighing down his limbs and clouding his thoughts. What made it worse was that he was out in the heat sweating, which also caused dehydration, creating a vicious cycle of physical depletion. The unrelenting sun and the vast, empty landscape contributed to a growing sense of fatigue and despair. Every element of the desert environment seemed designed to sap his remaining strength, leaving him feeling utterly spent and vulnerable to the harsh conditions. This combination of factors made his journey not just physically demanding, but also a profound mental challenge.
189	6167	3	3	To begin with, a feature that affected the cyclist was a lack of water; this is shown when the speaker says when he tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. That was one of the biggest factors he had risked, as finding a viable water source was critical for his survival in the desert. The terrible taste made it impossible to drink, turning a potential respite into another source of disappointment. This encounter with the undrinkable water from the old pump deepened his sense of crisis, highlighting how a single resource could mean the difference between continuing and succumbing. His hope for relief was dashed, compounding the physical hardship of his journey.
190	6168	3	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers, he faced many issues and also learned a lesson about self-reliance. As he began to ride into the daybreak of morning, he had strong legs and even a smile on his face, full of optimism for the adventure ahead. As time went on, he soon became close to out of water and suffered a loss of energy, the initial enthusiasm fading under the harsh realities of the journey. The intense summer day made him sweat and began to think that the birds would pluck at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite, a grim thought born of extreme fatigue. When he finally got to a town, he soon refreshed himself and learned that he would start to begin to follow his own way of getting to places, realizing the value of his own judgment over blindly following the advice of others. This hard-won wisdom became the most valuable souvenir from his challenging trek through the desert.
191	6169	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a profoundly negative way. The more and more he rode through the desolate landscape, he thought more negatively and had a lot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn’t make it and his mind was filled with grim possibilities. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes to one of deep uncertainty. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I’d be fine”. He seemed unsure and a little nervous, his resolve weakening with each empty mile. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems, his thoughts turning to despair. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary”. He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except the recurring “Rough Road Ahead” signs, which only reinforce his isolation and the immense difficulty of his task, ultimately leading him to a state of mental defeat.
192	6170	3	3	The features in the setting are very effective and challenging to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has a critically limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry, with the sun beating down relentlessly. He barely had any water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather, which drained his energy quickly. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated, a serious risk in such an exposed environment. Another significant obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the series of hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, but now he has steep hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him, demanding greater physical exertion. One other frightening obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into on the path. That setting had many obstacles for this guy, each one testing his limits. If it wasn't for the oppressive heat and the critical lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier, but combined, these elements created an overwhelmingly difficult journey.
193	6171	3	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist, presenting a series of physical trials. The rolling hills were the cyclist’s most challenging problem because they were long and crippling, seeming to stretch on forever. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist, as would the arduous climb back up. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on these relentless rolling hills would be extremely difficult, pushing him to his absolute limit. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their extreme difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatstroke under the harsh sun. However, the cyclist kept a positive attitude and did not give up, focusing on the goal ahead. His determination saved him as he felt immense relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp,"" a sign of civilization and respite. In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort than he anticipated, but with determination, you can accomplish anything and overcome the challenges of the journey."
194	6172	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” directly influencing his mental state. The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does, growing darker with the increasing difficulty. The narration states, “ a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie).” This sign symbolizes the escalating hardship he faces. Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse, his energy and optimism depleting in tandem. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy, a brief spark of hope, but his dreams are soon crushed by the reality of the empty landscape. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist, making him tired due to the lack of water and the growing sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and begins to believe he will die alone in the vast, unforgiving environment.
195	6173	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits, which dictated the pace of his travel. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist, forcing him to slow down and navigate with extra caution on the difficult path. Another significant feature was a steep hill on the route, which presented a major physical challenge. This affected the cyclist by making him tired and causing physical strain, as evidenced when he said “I wipe the sweat from my eyes,” a clear sign of his exertion and fatigue. These elements of the setting, though simple, directly shaped his experience by imposing both mental and physical demands on his journey, demonstrating how the environment can dictate the rhythm and difficulty of travel.
196	6174	3	3	The setting had a huge effect on the cyclist. One significant effect was the severe lack of water in the area he was in, which was a vast, arid desert. The profound lack of people in the desolate area didn’t help the cyclist out at all, offering no chance for assistance. The steep, unending hills on the road made it more tough on the cyclist because they drained what little energy he had left in his weary body. Also, the relentless sun beating down on him made his body more warm, causing dehydration and making it harder for him to focus on the difficult task at hand. Ultimately, the harsh environment proved to be a formidable adversary to his journey.
197	6175	3	3	"In the setting of “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning, the author is enjoying a nice campground outside Lodi, California, when some “old-timers” told the cyclist directions. From his point of view, ""they'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off out land marks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy aunt."" So the cyclist used that information and it wasn't for the better, as their directions led him astray. He found himself on a difficult and unexpected path, a consequence of trusting their confident but flawed advice. This experience taught him a valuable lesson about the reliability of information."
198	6176	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly. When an old man had told him, ""do you know where to go?"" the other guy was like, ""yes sir! I own a very good map,"" but the reality of the journey changed for the man riding the bike. He saw all of those towns and a sign that said ""Rough Road Ahead,"" a warning he had not anticipated. What had changed was he saw all of those buildings and towns, and he was going and going, realizing the landscape was more demanding than his map suggested. I think he might stick with the future, learning to rely on more than just old assurances. This decision will likely guide his travels from now on."
199	6177	3	3	In the story, the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest being the terrain that he had to maneuver through. The terrain was relentlessly hilly; having to go up a steep hill on a bike is tiring and wears you out faster than flat land would, making him use more of his dwindling energy. The oppressive heat was also unbearable, making it harder for him to focus, and the cyclist did everything he could to stay conscious while maneuvering through the terrain. The deserted landscape, a huge desert of rolling mountains, offered no respite as he pushed forward, finding no civilization anywhere to get a crucial refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn’t as hilled then it would have made it easier for him, using less energy and causing less strain on his legs. The heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress considerably, as heat will make you move slower. A cyclist moving down a burning road with no shade will make the journey seem longer and nearly impossible. In the end, his sheer will and determination got him through the landscape, so he could finally get the water he needed to finish his arduous trip.
200	6178	3	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritated toward the old men. In this essay, old men give the cyclist directions, and instead of using a reliable map, he takes their advice. However, their information is out of date, and it takes the cyclist through exhausting rolling hills and bumpy, poorly maintained roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and he finds himself with no water in the desolate area. The cyclist blames the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy and led him astray. However, he should really become angry with himself for taking their advice, and not using a credible map or seeking real, verified directions. This introspection marks an important realization about personal responsibility.
201	6179	3	3	The setting of where you are riding has a lot to do with the cyclist, influencing both their physical state and mental attitude. In my own opinion, I think the setting is the most important part of the entire cycling experience. A pleasant environment can uplift the spirit and make the ride enjoyable, while a harsh one can drain both energy and morale. The surroundings directly shape the cyclist's journey, making the context in which they ride fundamentally significant to the outcome and their overall feeling about the trip.
202	6180	3	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer-evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serene or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “enjoyed.” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cheery mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scenery affected the cyclist by making him happy. The same can be said for dreary scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This quote describes the scenery as a place that has tumbleweeds. Stereotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely places. This lonely scenery takes its toll on the cyclist. He becomes pessimistic and is thinking of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said to be affected by their grim surroundings. In conclusion, the setting does affect the cyclist and his mindset drastically, proving how deeply our environment influences our inner state.
203	6181	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into “short, rolling hills.” Because he was already running out of water, the changing terrain was making it harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and he had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had left. He even wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless and defeated by the harsh landscape. The oppressive features of the setting ultimately overwhelm his spirit and physical capacity.
204	6182	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer’s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “...I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are poor. It can be inferred that he meant they were obviously out of date when giving directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting, which presented both environmental and social obstacles that complicated his journey significantly.
205	6183	3	3	The terrain in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie presented many difficulties the cyclist had to cope with. He was already lacking water from the arduous journey and then the environment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing; flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills, energy he barely has. This exertion will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has left. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems as the desolate landscape saps his morale. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist, demonstrating how the physical challenges of the terrain are a central conflict in the narrative.
206	6184	3	3	In the story “Rough road ahead” the setting affects the cyclist significantly. The cyclist is affected by the lack of water, the considerable distance he has to travel, and the challenging hilly terrain. The line, “The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” powerfully illustrates his severe dehydration and the exhausting heat. The physical strain is further amplified by the relentless, steep hills that drain his remaining energy. Ultimately, the harsh setting affected the cyclist a lot in the story, creating a formidable obstacle course for his journey.
207	6185	3	3	The cyclist has it hard in the difficult conditions; the lack of water, the intense heat, and the rough terrain are all things that made his ride harder. First, the lack of water took a toll on the amount of energy he had to keep going, leaving him parched and weak. Second, the oppressive heat also affected his trip profoundly; it made it hard for him to keep going to the point where he thought he would die, imagining the birds would pick at his dead body. Last, the terrain didn’t help his progress. The trip had many steep hills and that used a lot of his energy, making the journey even more arduous. In conclusion, those are the primary things that worked against the cyclist throughout his challenging ride.
208	6186	3	3	The cyclist was being affected by several key elements of his environment. One way is the intense heat, which caused him to drink more water until he ran out completely, leaving him desperately thirsty. The next way is the misleading old men who gave him bad directions, leading him astray and wasting his precious energy. Another way was the long distance combined with the bad terrain, which consistently slowed him down and wore him out. The last reason is the unexpected snake on the path, which caused a delay and forced him to stop. All of these environmental factors contributed to the immense difficulty of his cycling trip.
209	6187	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways throughout his arduous journey. He was riding his bike across a remote and desolate place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food available to him. This isolation and lack of resources made it a dangerous journey for him, testing his limits both physically and mentally. Despite the overwhelming challenges presented by the unforgiving landscape, he demonstrated great perseverance and he made it to his destination in the end.
210	6188	3	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist in his struggle. One example is the condition of his water jar, which is nearly empty and offers little relief from his thirst. The cracked and dry earth of the terrain reflects the overall harshness of his environment, making every rotation of his bicycle tires a laborious effort. This simple detail of the jar's state highlights his vulnerability and the scarcity of resources. Therefore, the setting's features directly impact his physical state and his chances of success on the difficult road.
211	6189	3	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing around. It might make you want to go faster and let out your inner speed demon when there are no obstacles in sight. That’s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don’t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn’t even matter that much for a casual ride. Possibly for a dedicated bicyclist it can influence performance, but to me I don’t even think so, as the act of cycling itself is what counts most.
212	6190	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly, because there are no cars, buildings, water, or people in sight to offer any comfort or aid. It goes from a flat road to endless rolling hills, which sap his energy and spirit. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedaling, pushing through the fatigue. He sees a sign that reads, “Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit.” At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere, with no signs of life. If I was in his situation I would feel completely hopeless, as there was no sign of hope or rescue. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all, a landscape that offered no solace. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free, a feeling of immense relief washing over him. So he pedaled up to the building, and discovered that with all the others it was abandoned, crushing his spirit. The cyclist thought he was going to die there, alone. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope and amplifies his despair. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have given him some confidence, but that was not the case for him. He is in the middle of nowhere, a stark and unforgiving environment. He finally came to a bend and said, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me,” as he finally found his way to safety.
213	6191	3	3	There are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist on his difficult journey. His dehydration started with the sun beating down on him relentlessly, creating an intense thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and rode by an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory, a cruel reminder of his need. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head,” he thought in despair. Then when he had almost nothing left he spotted a bait shop in the distance, a potential source of help. “Somehow I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope,” he recounted, describing his struggle. “Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me,” he realized upon seeing a sign that read, “Gary and Mary’s Fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones we’re your best bet,” thus revealing his troubles were finally over and he had found a place of refuge.
214	6192	3	3	The features of the setting that the author cycled through definitely affect not only his mood, but his physical condition throughout the journey. To start, it is mentioned that he is in “the high deserts of California in June,” where it is implied that the weather is intensely hot, causing the author to sweat profusely as he bikes along under the scorching sun. Next there is a change in terrain and he soon approaches “rolling hills” which are naturally more difficult and exhausting to bike on than flat ground. Finally the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit, but he still has to manage getting past the rough road, which jolts his body and strains his muscles. After passing this difficult stretch he approaches a faded picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on an old juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him feeling more exhausted and frustrated than before, as it taunts him with what he cannot have. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author’s change in mood from determined to disheartened, showing how the environment directly shaped his experience.
215	6193	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly throughout his arduous journey. First, is the beating sun, whose relentless heat dehydrates him and almost kills him under its powerful rays. The rocky road is also a significant factor, as its uneven surface takes up the precious time and energy he has to perform, making every pedal stroke a struggle. Another key ingredient of the setting was the vast, empty desert surrounding him, which offered no respite. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water for miles, increasing his sense of isolation and danger. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story, as its harsh and unforgiving elements directly challenged his endurance and will to survive.
216	6194	3	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn’t drink it since it was so hot and nasty tasting. “When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was completely deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad, with steep and unrelenting grades. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,” (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattlesnake, adding another layer of physical danger. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in these many ways, both mentally and physically, by the unforgiving environment.
217	6195	3	3	The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was faced with a vast desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and with no water in sight. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together, leaving him utterly isolated. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope, sinking into despair. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…”. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in his mouth to stop thinking of his thirst and to stimulate some saliva. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally, pushing him to his absolute limits.
218	6196	3	3	The ways that the setting affects the cyclist include how the road is shaped or the challenge of riding up the hills and the roughness of the road itself. There was a sign where it said “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.” That sign was crucial; if he didn’t see it he would have exceeded the speed or not known what speed to maintain as a cyclist and could have gotten seriously hurt. The road was made for cars, so the speed limit is hard to judge and the surface is unforgiving for a bicycle. These physical aspects of the setting directly influenced his safety and the difficulty of his journey, demonstrating how the environment dictates the terms of his travel.
219	6197	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first part of his journey. In this setting he used up his water and it was intensely hot. This affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die from the heat. The text showed this when it said “I could drop from heat stroke”. Later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was, which taunted him. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirstier. This also made him feel disappointed and frustrated. The final setting affected him because he had finally found water and was no longer thirsty, providing a moment of relief. That is how the different settings affected the cyclist throughout his arduous trip.
220	6198	3	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was profoundly affected by the setting. He was affected by the lack of water, the intense heat and the bad directions he received. Throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men, which led him astray. ""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He ran out of water and became dangerously dehydrated through his trip. The heat played a major part in his dehydration during the bike ride under the scorching sun. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The trip was made even longer and more arduous due to some bad directions from some old men. “Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information, but the land has since changed and the directions were obsolete. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad hindrance. The cyclist experienced firsthand how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal, shaping his entire experience."
221	6199	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much. For example, the sun was beginning to beat down, its intense rays creating a shimmering haze on the asphalt ahead. Another example, I was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, draining them faster than anticipated. The setting was hot and dry, a parched landscape that seemed to suck the moisture from the very air. It affected the cyclist very much, draining his energy and wilting his resolve. It was to the point of dying, where every pedal stroke was a monumental effort against the oppressive heat.
222	6200	3	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obstacles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definitely not on his side that day, presenting a series of relentless challenges. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly, leaving his legs burning with fatigue. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, a constant drain on his dwindling reserves. After he got through the hills, he came to a sign that read, “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT”. Now he has to go through bumpy roads, the jarring vibrations adding a new layer of misery to the ride. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him, forcing a cautious and nervous detour. Thankfully he got by the snake, alive, his heart pounding from the close encounter. Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view, sparking a flicker of hope. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but it’s an abandoned building, its windows dark and empty. By the looks of it, it had been a Welch’s grape Juice Factory and bottling plant, a cruel irony that offered no relief to his profound thirst.
223	6201	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says “the sun was beating on me” this shows it was hot, the relentless heat radiating from the sky and the road surface. The direct and powerful sunlight caused him to sweat profusely, rapidly depleting his body's fluids. That's one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated, as the harsh environmental conditions directly contributed to his physical state, leaving him exhausted and longing for water.
224	6202	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut he was going to take. This misleading advice led him into a more difficult and isolated terrain than he had anticipated. Running out of water and energy, he was beginning to doubt himself and consider giving up on the race. It says he felt a growing sense of despair as the promised easy route turned into a grueling test of endurance, where the unforgiving landscape amplified his physical and mental struggles, pushing him toward the brink of surrender.
225	6203	3	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. This was because it was very ironic where he was. It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory, a sight so perfectly contrary to his needs that it sparked his black humor. The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind."" This vast and empty desolation gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive, a profound loneliness that made him despair. The cyclist felt relief later on due to the features. He eventually got to a bait shop. When he saw this living establishment, a sign of other people, he felt immense relief. Of this, it is written, ""Then as easily as the turn of a page, hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me."" In this piece the features of the setting were ultimately what determined how the cyclist felt throughout his arduous journey."
226	6204	3	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1, many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first “town” and said, “this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war.” This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply, so his spirits were not yet fully diminished. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn’t so mild. He says, “The sight was troubling,” as the promise of water turned into a visual cue of decay. Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn’t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid, a deeply unsatisfying and disheartening result. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned Welch’s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment, each location reinforcing the barrenness of the landscape. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless, creating a formidable physical and mental challenge. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it, pushing past the desolation that surrounded him.
227	6205	3	3	The story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is about a cyclist who got bad directions to Yosemite National Park and has a depleting water supply in extreme heat. He is doubtful that he will make his journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy, his physical state deteriorating with each passing mile under the relentless sun. The incorrect guidance led him into a remote and arid area, far from any reliable source of help or refreshment. His condition worsens as the journey continues, with the heat and lack of water creating a genuine crisis. This combination of factors places him in a perilous situation where his ultimate success is uncertain, testing his limits in the harsh environment.
228	6206	3	3	The setting in this story is important because if you don’t have a setting then the narrative will not make sense; setting is a foundational element that everyone can understand and utilize. It can be anywhere or anything, from a bustling city to a quiet countryside, providing the context for the events that unfold. The setting helps put the whole story back together, giving the actions of the characters a place to happen and a atmosphere to influence them. The setting in this story is @LOCATION1 spending time with his family, which grounds the narrative in a specific, relatable environment. Setting is a very important part in a movie or video, as it establishes the visual and emotional tone for the entire production, making the story cohesive and immersive for the audience.
229	6207	3	3	The way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding through a challenging and unexpected landscape. He would be moving through something you would never think he can get through, an environment that seems insurmountable at first glance. This could be a vast, sun-scorched desert or a steep, rocky mountain pass that tests his endurance to the absolute limit. Then, by overcoming his initial intention to give up, he finds a deeper strength and resolve within himself. The difficult setting acts as the primary obstacle that he must conquer, ultimately leading to his personal triumph and the successful completion of his arduous journey.
230	6208	3	3	The features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead” affect the cyclist profoundly. The cyclist started at a campground and was conversing with some old dodgers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and they tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date and leads him astray. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns, which heightens his sense of isolation and desperation. He is really thirsty and there’s no water anywhere, a constant and gnawing need that dominates his thoughts. He thought he was going to die, a fear that became increasingly real. He said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” a vivid and grim image of his anticipated fate. It was a hot summer day and there were tumbleweeds and snakes by the road, making him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road for relief. But it was hot and dry in California and desert-like, a harsh and unforgiving climate. It made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere with no signs of life or aid, and therefore the setting deeply and negatively affected the cyclist throughout his misdirected journey.
231	6209	3	3	This cyclist had the challenging conditions of the land to deal with, navigating a harsh and unforgiving environment. He didn’t have too much water with him, and there wasn't a good source anywhere near him that he could see, which heightened his sense of vulnerability. He just had to keep going, pushing forward despite the mounting difficulties. He also talked about how the road was rough, with uneven terrain that jolted his bike and body. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water, as the difficult path seemed to stretch the journey interminably. More over he was in a desert area, a vast expanse of sand and rock. The air was dry and hot, the oppressive heat was making him sweat profusely, and that was leading him to become dangerously dehydrated, a constant threat on his arduous trek.
232	6210	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the distinct features of the setting profoundly effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope, shaping his mental state throughout the ordeal. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people, like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up as “Ghost towns” and the road changes from flat to demanding hills. Yet he continues on and then says, in a moment of despair, “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” and “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going, desperately hoping that the next horizon will reveal a building or something, a sign of salvation. Hope saved his life because if he had given in to the belief that he could not continue, he truly could have died, demonstrating the power of perseverance against a bleak backdrop.
233	6211	3	3	The physical features of the setting directly affect the cyclist, creating a relentless challenge. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is intensely hot outside which makes him need more water, depleting his limited supply rapidly. An example of this is the statement, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Another compelling example of being hot outside is the description, “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This overwhelming heat from the environment relentlessly compounds his physical struggle, leaving him in a constant battle against dehydration and exhaustion.
234	6212	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting while trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men; what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough and unforgiving. One narrator states, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” highlighting his physical deterioration. The narrator is really taking a beating from the travel, and the jagged rocks and dry climate is really taking a toll on his endurance and spirit. From reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end, which offers a brief respite. Like the title states, the setting of this story was accurately a “Rough Road Ahead,” defining his entire difficult journey.
235	6213	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist through its specific features because if the cyclist was riding in a different, cooler location around june the affect of the month would not had been that harsh. The intense summer heat significantly amplified the challenges he faced. But overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing, creating a scenario of constant physical strain. The cyclist is affected by the setting through its direct impact on his body and resources, proving how environment dictates the difficulty of an endeavor.
236	6214	3	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the oppressive heat of California, and the difficult condition of the hilly path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult, steep trail would be worse with having the critical lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated, his throat parched and dry, and was on the verge of fainting from the exertion. If it were not so hot and the terrain less demanding, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition, able to continue his journey without such severe distress.
237	6215	3	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from severe dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people, which adds a layer of ironic wit to his harrowing tale. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk who might see folly as an adventure. Oh yeah, and the setting was a vast, unforgiving desert, which amplified the danger of his situation immensely.
238	6216	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot, sun scorching day, with relentless heat bearing down. Also he ran out of water and there was nothing but barren desert and poisonous snakes around, increasing his sense of isolation. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there was no snakes or warmers, just empty desert, so he started to become very thirsty and desperate. In the essay it also said he reached a part where he saw a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit”, so the road conditions starting to get rough for him, which was another effect. In the end of the essay he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold water there, this affects him because he feels replenished and finally safe. All these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his arduous journey.
239	6217	3	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirstier, his physical state deteriorating with the rising temperature. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead, the environment itself seemed to issue a warning. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid about what lay ahead, so that’s how the setting affected him, shaping his mental state as much as his physical one.
240	6218	3	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn’t any real water he could drink, the well being dry or the water undrinkable. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty for the remainder of his journey. Also, it’s the middle of June in California, it’s very hot and the sun is going to wear him out pretty quickly, sapping his energy. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down, which demanded great physical effort. For example, he says “Over one long, crippling hill”, he’s saying the hills are very hard for him and a significant obstacle. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story, creating a challenging and perilous trip.
241	6219	3	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June, which had the most significant impact on the cyclist compared to all other setting features. In the fifth paragraph, the reader learns that the author was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” My prior knowledge confirms that California is generally a very hot place, especially in the desert during June, the hottest month of the year. These extreme conditions would have greatly affected the cyclist, who was riding for over fifty miles through this arid landscape with a limited supply of water. This situation put him at a great risk for dehydration, a state he confirms he reaches in the last line of paragraph ten. The combination of the unforgiving terrain and the extremely hot conditions would inevitably make the cyclist very tired and severely dehydrated, thereby making his arduous journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult and dangerous.
242	6220	3	3	The various features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist in many ways during his journey. He was isolated in a vast desert, with no one to provide him with reliable information and no nearby towns that were still operational. Compounding this, it was an exceptionally hot summer day with no accessible water sources nearby. These environmental factors collectively impacted the cyclist by causing physical distress; he was not sweating properly, suffered from a dry mouth, and had no energy, which led to him having a lot of doubt that he would not complete his journey alive. In the story, the cyclist explicitly reveals his despair, stating, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die.'' This statement shows the depth of his doubt and hopelessness. Furthermore, every time he reached a potential source of help, such as a town or a building, he found it abandoned. The cruel irony of discovering an abandoned building that was once a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant only served to mock his plight and make him feel even thirstier. In these ways, the harsh features of the setting directly and severely affected the cyclist's physical and mental state.
243	6221	3	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist, primarily because the main setting was a desert where he was riding his bike. The desert environment is notoriously hot and dry, meaning he needed significantly more water to stay hydrated than he would have if he were riding in a cooler, shaded area like the woods or in a cold, snowy climate. Furthermore, the physical challenges of the landscape added to his ordeal; there were numerous hills on his travel route that he had to ride his bike up, which requires considerably more physical energy and exertion. Consequently, this increased effort again meant he would have needed more water than if the road had been consistently flat. Finally, the specific terrain of the desert also introduced other dangers, such as the animals he ran into, including a snake, which could have seriously hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in this demanding desert environment, the cyclist was affected more both physically and mentally than he had initially thought he would be.
244	6222	3	3	In this paragraph, I will be explaining some specific features of the setting that affected the cyclist during his journey. One significant effect was caused by the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying to cycle on. If the road surface had been flat and smooth, he would not have had to be as vigilant; however, the bumpy roads forced him to constantly look out for hazards like loose rocks and deep holes in the road to avoid an accident. Another major affect was caused by the presence of hills along his path. Ascending these inclines required him to put out a much greater amount of energy than if the route had been just flat, rapidly depleting his stamina. These challenging physical features of the landscape posed constant obstacles, and those are the key reasons that explain how the features of the setting negatively affected the cyclist.
245	6223	3	3	Some features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist on his difficult journey to Yosemite. Starting off, the advice from ad men who had not seen the changes in the world for about a decade gave the cyclist a bad start with misleading information about a shortcut. If the cyclist had not gotten this faulty shortcut information, he likely would not have ended up without water in a series of abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some old, rusty pumps, he decided to check them out to see if there was any water left. The water he found was not only warm but also tasted terrible, like battery acid, making it undrinkable. The cyclist decided to keep going despite this setback, even though he was running dangerously low on water. Later, when he came across a snake in the road, he had to navigate past it while in what he describes as his “dehydrated state.” I would imagine this would be particularly dangerous if one could not focus well on the road ahead due to exhaustion. He then came upon the @ORGANIZATION1 building, which he found to be dilapidated and abandoned. He obviously could not get any water there, seeing the poor and derelict condition the building was in. As a direct result of having no access to water, the cyclist became severely dehydrated, and unfortunately, there were no functional stops for water available on his journey that day to Yosemite.
246	6224	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways; it was like a crazy maze, the road he was on, and him not really knowing where he was going didn’t help him, or not having enough water. The confusing network of paths offered no clear direction, and the physical strain was compounded by his dwindling supplies. This combination of navigational difficulty and resource scarcity created a formidable challenge. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, demonstrating the profound impact of environment on an individual's journey.
247	6225	3	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worse he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed with a hint of disbelief. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of the once existing civilization, and he says, “This sight is troubling,” as the signs of life faded away. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign, a clear omen of the physical hardship to come. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him, his physical state mirroring the bleak landscape. The climate in the story also becomes increasingly difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, but as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew increasingly wary and delirious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, with its unforgiving terrain and climate, had an enormous effect on him emotionally, eroding his spirit step by step."
248	6226	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation. He said “sometimes life can be so cruel,” because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience all at once. Also a snake, which ""it really did look like a diamond back,"" could have killed him, adding a sudden, visceral threat to his ordeal. He was in the desert and anything could happen, a place of relentless danger. The setting of old men who didn't know anything and the oppressive heat could have killed the cyclist by leading him astray and sapping his vitality. The situation would have been entirely different if it were anywhere else, but the desert's specific features created a perfect storm of peril."
249	6227	3	3	The cyclist's problem in the story is dehydration, and the California terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed extreme temperatures in summer, and the cyclist was exerting himself, so dehydration was an inevitable consequence. In the story the cyclist says, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June,” so the setting is obviously a hazard, where even beautiful weather masks a deadly risk. The arid, sun-scorched landscape directly creates the central conflict of his physical survival, proving the environment itself is a primary antagonist.
250	6228	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider he might die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc.; another dangerous feature of the setting, in addition to it being in a desert in summer, is its abandoned state, for example the author notes the town “might have been a thriving little spot at one time—sat, before the last world war”. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says, “I was going to lie…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope,” capturing his internal struggle. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He learns, because the setting is now lifeless and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson about the harsh reality of the present landscape versus nostalgic memory.
251	6229	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the author was exhausted and dehydrated, and as she was riding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle. The arid landscape offered no relief, with the relentless sun beating down and the path stretching onward without a single service station or public rest area in view. This lack of basic amenities directly intensified her physical struggle, highlighting how the environment itself posed a significant challenge to her journey. Ultimately, the unforgiving setting became a central antagonist in her narrative, testing her endurance to its limits.
252	6230	3	3	The road was deserted; there wasn't a building, car, or house in sight. He was stuck and helpless in the middle of nowhere without any water or food, where poisonous snakes and the intense heat could make him collapse. The sheer isolation was absolute, with only the empty horizon stretching out in every direction under a blistering sun. This complete lack of resources or assistance turned the setting into a direct threat to his survival. In such a desolate place, the environment itself was the greatest danger he faced.
253	6231	3	3	"The cyclist on her trip sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in the high deserts of California in June (Kurmaskie). We all know deserts are steaming hot and dry, especially in June. She also encounters hills (Kurmaskie); to make matters worse, she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat. The combination of the scorching sun and the demanding inclines created a grueling challenge that tested her resolve. Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles, she makes it to a camp and lives. ""I could see the horizon, telling myself that I could make it that far, I'd be fine"" (Kurmaskie). This shows the author's dedication and that if you don't give up, you will be fine, proving that perseverance can overcome even the most daunting physical settings."
254	6232	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting is an all-important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details of each place he stops, such as “one ramshackle shed…and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule…” and “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite…” These vivid descriptions paint a clear picture of the rapidly changing scenery through which the cyclist travels. In a story such as this, setting is of great importance, especially since it is so dynamically shifting. The story itself would be of much different quality, likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past; this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is. The careful attention to the environment is therefore essential to the narrative's power and appeal.
255	6233	3	3	The setting of the cyclist was harsh; the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day. The sun was relentless, and the air was heavy with heat, making every pedal stroke a test of willpower against the oppressive conditions. This extreme environment directly challenged the cyclist's physical limits and determination. Ultimately, the severity of the setting defined the entire experience, turning the journey into a formidable trial of endurance.
256	6234	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect cyclists because if you are a person riding a bike, you might have to worry about falling off your bike or running out of water. If you keep at a fast pace and do not have any water, then you can get severely dehydrated. In the essay, it tells how he had run out of water and he thought he was going to die; he had become dehydrated but luckily he had found somewhere to get something to drink. This highlights how the physical environment, particularly the heat and lack of resources, directly impacts a cyclist's physical state and survival. Ultimately, the setting proves to be a critical factor that can dictate the success or failure of a cycling journey.
257	6235	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed the Stated Limit,"" the man's ride gets pretty rough. Because he took the old men's advice on a shortcut, the once enjoyable ride became a harrowing ordeal through a desolate landscape. The path he was promised turned out to be treacherous and unforgiving, leading him far from any source of help or water. This poor decision, based on misguided guidance, transformed a simple bike trip into a desperate struggle for survival. The narrative shows how a single choice, influenced by the setting and its inhabitants, can drastically alter the entire experience of a journey."
258	6236	3	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that affect him differently according to the setting. At first, the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a “ghost town.” He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait shop, which promised a chance for respite and hydration. The biker's feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did, demonstrating a clear link between his emotional state and his physical surroundings. This constant shift illustrates the powerful and direct influence that a journey's environment has on a traveler's psyche.
259	6237	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers” and they give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling he starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate for water because he is out in the desert in the middle of June, a time of extreme heat. The setting's harsh and isolated nature directly creates the crisis of dehydration and despair, proving that the environment is a central character in his story.
260	6238	3	3	The features of a setting can affect a cyclist very well or not. It depends on what conditions are happening. For example, he could fall on a rocky trail, and the outcome would depend on whether he has a traveling first aid kit to treat his wounds. Similarly, a sudden change in weather, like a rainstorm, could either be a refreshing cool-down or a dangerous situation leading to hypothermia. The setting presents challenges and resources that directly influence the cyclist's experience and safety. Therefore, the journey's quality is inherently tied to the specific features and conditions of the environment through which one travels.
261	6239	3	3	Setting is a very important element to the story “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply, and the constant threat of wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, severe dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being lost in such an unforgiving landscape. Dealing with wild life can also be a significant obstacle, as encounters are unpredictable. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals for your own safety. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no harsh weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting or impactful.
262	6240	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal, directly influencing his journey's difficulty. For example, a road sign declared “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was going a mere 12 mph, where the posted speed limit was 55 mph, highlighting the vast difference between his pace and that of motorized travel. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going, demonstrating his determination. Furthermore, not only was the land adding pressure to the cyclist, but so does the oppressive heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” showing his physical vulnerability. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance, creating a dual challenge. Ultimately, the setting profoundly affects the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure throughout his arduous trip.
263	6241	3	3	This story was a great motivation for older men, showing that they can still be healthy and feel like a teenager again through determination and effort. It showed how much effort he put into his goal and how he managed to survive the demanding journey. For forty miles he peddled, striving through the harsh conditions for forty miles to drink the same water the cyclist was describing, which made for an interesting and compelling story not giving up. His perseverance serves as a powerful example that age does not have to be a barrier to adventure and achieving one's personal goals, proving that spirit and willpower are truly ageless qualities.
264	6242	3	3	The setting affects a cyclist profoundly because the environmental condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel across a given terrain. Challenging landscapes and severe weather inevitably slow progress and demand greater physical exertion, directly impacting the cyclist's speed and overall travel time. This relationship between the environment and the rider's capabilities is a fundamental aspect of any long-distance cycling narrative, illustrating how external factors shape the journey's rhythm and challenges from start to finish.
265	6243	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in Joe Kurmaskie's narrative. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June, amplifying the risk of heat-related illness. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility and a constant concern. Another example, is from paragraph ten, which explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and a large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance, especially without water to maintain his strength. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice; this mental image made the cyclist think more about water and become very thirsty, tormenting him psychologically. Although their was some positive effects of the setting on the cyclist as well. The small pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst, providing minor relief. Also, the bait shop eventually allowed him to obtain something to drink, and not die from dehydration, offering a crucial reprieve that enabled him to continue his journey.
266	6244	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside, the cyclist does not have enough water to combat the intense heat. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example, the tumbleweeds and the snakes present physical obstacles and potential dangers. Being that it's not out of the question, the desert is most likely in the process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated from the combined effects of the sun and the arid environment. I believe these are the reasons the setting is so challenging because it all makes a lot of sense and significantly affects the cyclist's journey and well-being.
267	6245	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the lack of accessible, cool water was the biggest thing he faced. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy after hours of pedaling. He would get tired out faster under the relentless sun. Even if he does find water its hot, like when he says, ""brackish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This shows how in ""the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot, having been heated by the surrounding earth. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn’t cool down because the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot and unrefreshing. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it efficiently. We know the roads are rough when he says, “large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" This also shows you couldn’t go fast without risking a fall or damage to his bicycle."
268	6246	3	3	"The cyclist is severely dehydrated from his journey. He has had a lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right, had he been riding,"" before the last word war, about the scarcity of resources. But any “town” he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert, offering no relief. He says, “It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself,” which indicates that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to give up entirely. He still had enough energy to keep going, pushing forward even as “hope was fading” with each empty mile. Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back at the sight of civilization. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” and knows his ordeal is nearly over. The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink, finally quenching his powerful thirst. He is now safe, ready to ride again, and avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years, having learned a hard lesson about the desert."
269	6247	3	3	The harsh setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie made the journey for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistency of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down, as evidenced by the line, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot and suffering due to the intense summer heat, which saps his strength. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistent quality of the pavement on the road, as noted when “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This change in terrain proves that the road itself could be slowing the cyclist also, forcing him to expend more energy. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him from both the environment and the path itself. But if he keeps his head up and perseveres through these hardships, he can make it to his destination of “Yosemite.”
270	6248	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hotness of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating profusely, and quickly drinking through his water bottles without a ready supply for a refill. The extreme heat directly contributed to his physical strain and dehydration. Also when the cyclist saw the building in the distance, he thought he could rest in the shade and maybe even get a ride to where he was going to escape the harsh conditions. But, the building was abandoned years earlier with broken windows and dust, so the cyclist couldn’t stop and find the help he desperately needed, forcing him to continue his arduous journey. These are some of the key features of the setting that negatively affect the cyclist's progress and physical state.
271	6249	3	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources ñ especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,î was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the cooler winter months, for example, he would have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people, which emphasizes his isolation. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water, which made the trip extra hard and discouraging. ìI was going to dieî he says, showing his desperation. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,î and this characteristic is a setting, like the others, that negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder and more physically demanding.
272	6250	3	3	"The cyclist's surroundings did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how ìI enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was a reassuring assurance that everything would be fine. Confidence was a factor because of the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In a later paragraph the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out ìthis breezy jaunt.î The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in another paragraph the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about; it was desolate and abandoned. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In the next paragraph, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,"" indicating his growing thirst. This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the heat that felt like ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings would have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist succeeded in his arduous journey."
273	6251	3	3	The features of the setting in *Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit* by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town that is further than he thinks. The quote, ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,î shows the cyclist did not have much confidence in this desolate area of the journey. The harsh environment, marked by extreme heat and a lack of resources, creates a profound sense of despair and vulnerability. This feeling of hopelessness is a direct result of the unforgiving desert setting that surrounds him, pushing him to his physical and mental limits as he struggles to find civilization.
274	6252	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills, making the ride difficult. One example is on a page where the cyclist thinks, ìwith any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throatî. This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous and uncomfortable for travel. The poor state of the path adds a layer of physical risk to the journey, constantly challenging the cyclist's endurance. That is how the condition of the road can be affective, turning a simple ride into a hazardous ordeal.
275	6253	3	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strong legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and rough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence. As he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terrain he says, ""i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the querying that he says, ""i was going to die and the birds would pick me cleanî. This shows that by this time his confidence was lost because of the insane heat and unbearable terrain. He begins to lose his sanity along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible and hostile, ultimately demonstrating how the environment directly dictated his mental and physical state."
276	6254	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he starts off, he is bright and happy, just as the scenery is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing is wrong, as he notes, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold road, however, his morale was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried because he needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling,” he thought. There he finds a water plant and his hopes rise a bit, until he discovers the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees.” So he moves on and finally he reaches life-giving water! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck. “Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” Ultimately, the setting affects his mood in a very big way; the cyclist feels precisely as the setting looks, from serene to desperate and back again.
277	6255	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. One way it impacts him is because it is so hot and he doesn’t have any water left, which creates a deep sense of urgency. Also, because there are so many abandoned buildings and ghost towns, this gives him a false hope that he will be able to get the water he desperately needs from these desolate places. The emptiness of the structures mirrors his own growing desperation, and the harsh, dry environment directly dictates his declining physical state and anxious mental outlook throughout his difficult journey.
278	6256	3	3	Almost all of the cyclist’s surroundings are old and barren, dominated by hot @CAPS1-like weather. The road itself is hard to ride on, changing from a flat path to a more challenging one, as “Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.” So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one, with the unforgiving terrain and the oppressive heat combining to drain his energy and intensify the physical difficulty of his journey through the bleak landscape.
279	6257	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by undermining his confidence in where he’s going and how he’s going to get there. Having no water in such a vast and demanding landscape creates a profound sense of uncertainty and vulnerability. The sheer scale and emptiness of the environment erode his self-assurance, making every mile a test of his resolve and casting doubt on his entire route and his ability to complete the journey successfully.
280	6258	3	3	If the sun had not been so blaring and the road so treacherous, his journey would have been different. Also, the “devation” often bothers the author because he had to get over the dry conditions and dehydration, which were constant physical and mental challenges. The relentless environmental factors directly shaped his experience, proving that the harshness of the setting was the primary source of his hardship and struggle.
281	6259	3	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket for warmth, and if it's hot you need water to prevent dehydration. Depending on how secure the location is, the consequences could range from minor inconvenience to a matter of life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired quickly, and if you have no water in such a demanding terrain you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, a small town, a vast desert, or a busy highway; all these environmental factors play a huge roll in determining the safety and success of a cycling journey. Ultimately, a cyclist's preparation and experience are profoundly shaped by the specific characteristics of the route they choose to take.
282	6260	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in critical ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather, a time known for intense heat. If it wasnít so hot, he wouldnít have needed water as badly and his body would not have been under such strain. He wouldnít have been sweating as much, conserving his vital fluids. Also, there werenít any buildings or cars around, so there wasnít anyone to help him in an emergency. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.î This profound isolation, combined with the harsh climate, shows how critical features of the setting could affect the cyclist's physical state and his chances of survival.
283	6261	3	3	In the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting directly affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling ìthrough the high deserts of California in Juneî(Kurmaskie). This specific location and time of year affect him by ensuring he would be dehydrated faster under the relentless sun. The cyclist, who is the author, is so dehydrated before he can make it to the next town that he resorted to desperate measures, as he ìgathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouthî(Kurmaskie) to stimulate saliva. This vivid detail underscores the powerful and dangerous impact of the environmental conditions on his journey.
284	6262	3	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting profoundly affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer, a period of rising temperatures. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult and isolated places that were challenging to get out of. As the sun beat down and his water started to deplete, getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June, a notoriously hot and dry region. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination, further draining his energy. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster, accelerating his physical decline. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,î the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on a pebble in an effort to take his mind off his overwhelming thirst. When he finally found a habited store he was exhausted and profoundly relieved. The features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist; the weather dehydrated him while the demanding terrain exhausted him, demonstrating how environment shapes a journey's outcome."
285	6263	3	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically. The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted, causing it to diminish rapidly. If he had been riding in the cooler seasons then his water supply wouldíve lasted longer and he wouldíve had more energy for the arduous trip. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker and his hopes for respite were dashed. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist wouldíve likely died from dehydration and exhaustion. Luckily though it wasnít and he was able to drink life-saving water. The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice, something the cyclist couldínt do in his parched state. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him profoundly. Since Iíve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy, a progression the cyclist experienced firsthand.
286	6264	3	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects on the cyclist because of the settings are all apparent throughout the story. For example, when the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. This positive physical effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once more. The setting also affects the cyclist mentally very substantially. This can be seen when the cyclist is in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy and secure in this pleasant area. This positive mental effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite with renewed vigor. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle” @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, he feels troubled and anxious. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water and the desolate sight. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless"" when cycling in the dry, arid terrain under the harsh sun. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this unforgiving place. Finally, the cyclist felt profoundly relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his troubles are now “behind” him. The setting's positive effect in this instance changes his mental state from negative to positive. Ultimately, setting was the main factor in deciding the cyclist’s physical and mental state, affecting him in both positive and negative ways almost equally in the story."
287	6265	3	3	"The setting made the cyclist feel intensely lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she never saw any people or sources of water on the long, empty way. The cyclist said they saw a “ghost town,” which deepened the sense of isolation. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dangerously dehydrated. This physical strain caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die, completely alone. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,"" a vivid thought that shows his despair. It is clear that the harsh, desolate setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way, both physically and emotionally, pushing him to the brink of his endurance."
288	6266	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly because he was traveling through a dense forest. This was a bumpy trip with a lot of troubles and obstacles along the way, such as uneven paths and difficult terrain. This was a long and arduous trip that tested his limits. But he made it through the challenging journey, enduring the physical strain and mental fatigue, and he emerged tough with a story to tell in the end. His perseverance through the forest setting ultimately led to a sense of accomplishment.
289	6267	3	3	The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affects the cyclist's physical condition and emotional attitude profoundly. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning, and the air was still cool. So, the cyclist was happy and strong, filled with optimism. He was confident he could conquer anything the road presented. As the day grew on, “the sun was beginning to beat down” with increasing intensity. He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong, pushing forward. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling,” and his confidence began to wane. The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California, a harsh and unforgiving landscape. He was becoming tired and thirsty, his body straining. He had to save as much water as possible, which added to his anxiety. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a desperate survival ride. Once the cyclist finds water he is immensely relieved, his spirits lifting. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination with renewed purpose. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically; just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on, demonstrating the power of environment over human endurance.
290	6268	3	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident and excited to have been offered new directions from some “old wise men” which promise a convenient shortcut. His initial water supply is mediocre and his attitude is willed against the flat and hilly terrain, until he realizes the directions are way off target and his situation becomes dire. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first “town” but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling, increasing his sense of unease. As he continued, hoping the shortcut offered by the old “codgers” would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert with a depleting water supply and a dwindling spirit. He was deeply disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his pain and despair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt screwed over by the bad advice, yet through his sheer will and determination, by rationing his remaining water and mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physical, emotional and mental trials. He lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old “codgers” on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be outdated and unreliable.
291	6269	3	3	The whys the setting affected the cyclist is that the hotter it was the more water that he drank, creating a direct link between the rising temperature and his diminishing supply. Also the further he traveled the more tired he got which caused him to get hotter from the physical exertion and which caused him to drink more of his water, establishing a difficult cycle of fatigue and dehydration.
292	6270	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first he seemed at ease talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite, envisioning a pleasant journey. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive, his initial confidence fading. He was running out of water and he thought he saw a diamondback, his mind playing tricks from the heat and exhaustion. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h.'' and began to wonder how he was going to survive the relentless pace. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch’s grape factory, wondering why his life was so cruel as to lead him there. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination, his resolve hardening. He picked out spires on the horizon and rode to them, making his way across the vast desert. He finally made it to “Only and Wilber’s fish camp where he knew he was safe and would survive, his arduous journey complete.
293	6271	3	3	The hot, dry, and barren setting affected the cyclist greatly. Barren is a hot, dry and abandoned place, offering no relief from the sun. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park, a challenging goal under such conditions. He decides to follow the directions of a couple old men, which was a significant mistake. “Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,” (Kurmaskie), he realized their advice was outdated and unreliable. The hot and dry conditions made the cyclist's hardest obstacle staying hydrated, as the environment constantly sapped his moisture.
294	6272	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the intense heat and sun. With the cyclist having a limited amount of water, it affected him too, creating a constant state of worry. The cyclist listened to the old men so therefore he traveled a good distance on a poor route. So that made matters bad from the very start. With having a lack of water with such a distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst, a desperate measure for relief. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because of dehydration, his fear becoming vivid. The conditions of the road made it harder; first he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill, the terrain adding to his struggle. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he originally thought it would be.
295	6273	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the setting has lots of hills, making the ride physically demanding. Also there was no water available in the environment, a critical problem. For example, in the story he says it was a hilly area, difficult to traverse on a bicycle. Also he says that there are no buildings; he is all by himself which would make him feel scared and isolated. So the setting affects the cyclist by being a very hot, dry climate with no water and no buildings; and no people to ask for directions would make him scared and lost and fearful of what is going to happen to him during his solitary journey.
296	6274	3	3	"During the cyclist's journey he was faced with many adversities and challenges. Mostly the driver was fatigued and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out of water and the deserted town offered no respite. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the threat of heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way, which emphasized his profound isolation and vulnerability in the harsh landscape. These environmental factors combined to create a journey of significant hardship and endurance."
297	6275	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the hot sun and the vast deserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left. The rough, cracked pavement made pedaling arduous, while the relentless sun beat down upon him, sapping his strength further. The seemingly endless deserts offered no shade or relief, stretching out in all directions. With his energy reserves nearly depleted, these reasons why the journey was so difficult became overwhelmingly clear, testing his physical and mental resolve to the absolute limit.
298	6276	3	3	As if a long bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” The heat is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and the lack of humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gear he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This meant his endurance is being tested because it is going to require tolerance, energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in direct sunlight, water could even evaporate over time. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good, creating an environment designed to exhaust and defeat a traveler.
299	6277	3	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows his pace and clouds his judgment. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren’t up to date nowadays, leading him on a path that may no longer be accurate or safe. This combination of physical scarcity and potentially misleading information creates a situation where the cyclist must navigate not only the physical terrain but also the uncertainties of outdated local knowledge, compounding the difficulties of his journey significantly.
300	6278	3	3	The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively and suggestible. “Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice…” (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it. This describes a state of impulsive enthusiasm, where the cyclist's judgment was likely overshadowed by the spirited atmosphere and the charismatic, though perhaps unreliable, guidance of the locals he encountered.
301	6279	3	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and introduces tough hazards. The weather is intensely hot, and just enduring the high temperatures is challenging enough, but journeying through a vast desert with a limited supply of water had to be a miserable experience. The relentless warmth of the desert had a profound affect on the cyclist and caused him to be overcome with fatigue. This physical drain delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well, slowing his progress considerably. Not only did he have to endure the tough weather, but he also faced hazardous conditions throughout his ride. There were specific times when obstacles like tumbleweeds crossed his path and he even encountered a ridiculously large snake. Such encounters delayed him further as he had to take precious time to cycle carefully around these impediments. As you can see, this combination of environmental and physical challenges made for a profoundly difficult journey for the rider and deeply affected the cyclist's morale and pace.
302	6280	3	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly, creating a landscape of profound isolation. All he has around him are endless, rolling hills, rough terraine under his tires, and vast expanses of sand punctuated by drifting tumble weeds. These desolate features leave him thinking he will die because there is no visible life around him, no sign of other people or sustenance. Everything is dry and vivid in its harshness, and that is exactly how it makes him feel internally—parched and exposed. The discovery of an old, rusty water pump only reinforces this despair, showing that it hasnít been used in ages and is completely derelict. The fact that only black, unusable tar pumped out from it is no help to his negative thought of life, confirming his fears of being stranded without aid in an unforgiving environment.
303	6281	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, ranging from the oppressive temperature, the bleak surroundings, and the critical availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt profoundly tired and exhausted because of the scorching temperature and the difficult terrain he had to pedal across. For example, his statement, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,î illustrates the severity of his situation. One can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the lonely roads, a condition that would make anyone feel tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him psychologically and made him have less confidence as he rode further into the unknown. For example, his observation that ìThis place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town,î shows how the decaying environment he witnessed caused him to feel unsure of where he was going and what he would find. Iíd feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation, losing my sense of direction and purpose. Lastly, the severe lack of water made him scared for his basic survival. For example, his resolution to ìconserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit,î indicates the depth of his concern. It made him think the situation wasnít good and that he was in genuine peril. So as one can see, the various elements of the setting combined to affect the cyclist in many significant ways during his arduous trip.
304	6282	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the author uses features of the setting to show the effects on the cyclist, building a narrative of struggle and determination. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch, relying on their local knowledge. The essay explicitly said, ìNever accept braid advice from a collection of old- timers who havenít let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. ìThis shows the old men could be wrong and that places can change over time, making their guidance potentially unreliable. Also, on this supposed short cut he almost runs out of water, which becomes a major crisis. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se ñ a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of his vital water supply but has to summon the determination to get to his destination. Lastly the terrain itself affects him profoundly. The Hills prove to be a particular challenge, especially with a limited supply of water to sustain his energy. The essay states that flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined to press on despite the exhausting topography. Even though the hills added considerably to the struggle, he ultimately made it through the difficult passage. That is how the author effectively used features of the setting to add to the overall struggle and test the resolve of the cyclist on his journey.
305	6283	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they figured that the local people, like the old-timers on the porch, were old enough and had seen what was going on in the area for many years. Having been through that situation themselves and possessing a deep familiarity with the landscape, they were well experienced and seemed to know more about what was going on and the potential routes. Consequently, the cyclist felt that people should listen to them and trust their judgment, even if the advice ultimately led to unforeseen difficulties and challenges on the road ahead. This dynamic highlights how the social setting, represented by the locals, directly influenced the cyclist's decisions and subsequent experiences.
306	6284	3	3	After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to wane. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined, his spirits high with the promise of a quicker route. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, a dry canal and a couple of water pumps, he began to feel touched by a sense of impending failure. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tasted like battery acid,” utterly undrinkable. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more with each difficult mile. He travelled through the desert and encountered a “ridiculously large snake,” which heightened his anxiety while he was already running dangerously low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enough was an abandoned juice factory; a sign featuring a lemur sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose all hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter, his journey seemingly over. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was finally founded, offering him a real chance at salvation.
307	6285	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few significant ways. For example, the features of the “Rough Road” didn't allow him to arrive as fast as he hoped, so he was driving on a reduced speed limit, which slowed his progress considerably. Second, the fact that he was driving through a desert became starkly apparent when a large snake made its way onto the road, causing the man to have to ""ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" a tense and precarious moment. Furthermore, because he was driving through the desert, he got so hot and started to get dehydrated from a profound lack of water, which sapped his strength. Lastly, the feature that there weren't any buildings for many miles meant he was left lost and didn't have anywhere to stop and ask for directions, compounding his isolation. These few features of the harsh environment definitely affected the cyclist profoundly throughout his arduous journey."
308	6286	3	3	There were many features of the setting that affect the cyclist to make his difficult journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but they were not very wise in their guidance. For example, “I followed their advice and launched out at first light, and along a ‘short cut’ that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed, leading him into a barren and challenging landscape. Furthermore, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate rapidly. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is showing you an image of just how hot and unforgiving the climate he is riding through truly is. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, both of which can lead to death. For example “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This is stating that without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die, highlighting the extreme peril created by the setting. The environment itself was the greatest obstacle he had to overcome.
309	6287	3	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting often affects the character in profound ways. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing but desolation. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me”. This quote explains that the character, the cyclist, was confused and disheartened by the complete lack of useful resources. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels extremely hot from the oppressive climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it is intensely hot outside, which would make the water hot and unrefreshing. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed unexpectedly. ""The smooth road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work much harder, and use more of his dwindling energy. These difficult conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination, testing his resolve at every turn."
310	6288	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” affected the cyclist greatly throughout his journey. For starters it says he was “traveling through the high deserts” which is never a safe thing for a lone rider, exposing him to extreme elements. He had been drinking his water regularly but the relentless temperature was rising, quickly depleting his vital supply. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state,” a clear sign of his deteriorating condition. This was from a lack of water because the terrain and heat had altered his water into an unpalatable state. The setting of the story was ultimately cruel to the cyclist, presenting one harsh challenge after another and pushing him to his physical limits.
311	6289	3	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn’t dehydrate himself, a delicate and constant balancing act. The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, creating a jarring ride that rattled his bones, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they’ll do, adding a layer of constant vigilance to the physical hardship. Ultimately, the harsh environment dictated every decision and action he took.
312	6290	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider conserve water carefully, rationing every sip. Another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature, which beat down relentlessly, sapping his energy. The rider would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster, heeding their local knowledge of the land and its shortcuts. Their advice proved invaluable for navigating the challenging journey ahead, helping him overcome the environmental obstacles he faced.
313	6291	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn’t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke, its intensity pressing down on him like a physical weight. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist, testing his physical limits and his will to continue.
314	6292	3	3	During the cyclist’s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “ there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn’t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn’t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie’s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “ the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position, compounding his exhaustion. In the end, it was the combination of all these harsh elements that created such an immense strain on him.
315	6293	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face, making every movement a conscious effort. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well, demonstrating resilience against the adverse conditions."
316	6294	3	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast, losing essential body fluids through sweat. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath, as the frigid air can constrict your airways. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly from the constant exertion, and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself on the uneven ground. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist suffering from dehydration. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you, leaving you stranded without aid. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.
317	6295	3	3	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun beating down relentlessly, no trees for shade, and no water sources anywhere in sight. The cyclist was also feeling lesy and increasingly weak from the heat. In the story he said ìI and the growing ??? :??? That I could drop from heat stroke.î, clearly expressing his fear of succumbing to the harsh conditions. The unrelenting environment thus posed a severe threat to his well-being.
318	6296	3	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn’t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink, leaving her vulnerable to the elements. Also listening to old guys who didn’t know much didn’t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel, one that was longer and more exposed. This combination of inadequate preparation and poor advice significantly increased the difficulty of her journey.
319	6297	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction, misled by the initial pleasant conditions. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid, making it nearly undrinkable. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope at the beginning and nearly lead him to his death in the harsh desert.
320	6298	3	3	The way the setting of the story help the guy out alot. He was riding and it was hot but with ìcool pines and risum riverî it was worth the ride. The shade from the trees and the nearby water kept the temperature down. It keep him cool so he could get his weter in the nex town without suffering from the heat. That is why I think that the pin and river were a big help, providing crucial relief during his difficult journey.
321	6299	3	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, or the tumble weeds, all are things that significantly affect the cyclist. The lack of water directly impacts the cyclist because it is exceptionally hot outside and he constantly needs hydration to continue. The hills also present a major challenge for him because it is physically hard to peddle up the steep inclines, draining his energy. Finally, there are the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look, emphasizing the harsh environment. When he sees tumble weeds rolling across his path, he try's to keep his balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesnít want to crash and get injured. The dehydration and lack of water affect the author profoundly because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lacking both water and energy, it makes your ultimate goal much more hard to complete, testing your willpower.
322	6300	3	3	In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this, as shown in the sentence, ìI chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on.î Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by the sight of a ìramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June.î He is visibly agitated by this discovery, makes a significant dent in his precious water supply, and unfortunately continues his journey. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon suffers a breakdown. He reflects on his deteriorating condition, thinking, ìTelling myself that if I could make it that far, Iíd be okay.î The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist, systematically eroding his spirit.
323	6301	3	3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree, full of optimism. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town, and the setting isnít described in detail because the cyclist is not worried yet, his spirits still high. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the oppressive heat because, ìthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.î The cyclist still has high spirits at this stage, looking forward to his destination. The cyclist begins to get genuinely thirsty when he comes upon a water pump, a potential oasis. He attempts to get water but the pump isnít in working condition, which is a major disappointment. Until this point in the story the road has been mostly flat and straight, offering little resistance. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some challenging hills in it, complicating his progress. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated, his strength fading. After one particularly difficult hill the cyclist sees a building, a sign of possible respite. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in and his intense thirst. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort to create saliva and gives up hope of living, when he finally comes upon a fish camp. He gets life-saving water from the bathroom and all is well, his hope restored. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in, demonstrating the direct link between environment and mental state.
324	6302	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, shaping his difficult experience. When in the essay it states, ìThe sun was beginning to beat down,î this shows that the intense heat affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can severely affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun bears down on him hard. Also when he states ìI was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,î this shows he was also dehydrated once going, moving very slow because of the amount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area. These environmental factors combined to create a grueling challenge for the cyclist, testing his endurance to its limit.
325	6303	3	3	I believe the cyclist is alone on his journey, and I think the old man he encountered should have shot him to put him out of his misery. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded and unnecessarily dangerous. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape you are in, you should not even go on a really long rider on a bicycle through such hostile territory, as the risks far outweigh any potential rewards.
326	6304	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty, causing his mouth to feel like dust. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue, straining his leg muscles with every painful pedal stroke. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to, leaving him isolated and without aid. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey, creating a truly formidable challenge that tested his physical and mental limits to their very core.
327	6305	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” in three ways. One way is that it is very barren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down on the cyclist's body which adds to his dehydration and lack of focus, making his vision swim. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain; the rolling hills and desert he bikes through make him work harder, using up more energy and exhausting his water supply; the desert also with its intense heat makes him not trust himself, thinking the mirages he sees are real. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns; when he sees them he gets a hope of relief that he might get water and escape the heat, but when he passes in he finds nothing and it leaves him crestfallen and thinking of death, a profound despair that saps his will to continue.
328	6306	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle; hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad for survival. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing in sight, no sign of life or rescue, just an endless, shimmering expanse of sand and rock under a relentless sky.
329	6307	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirt hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination, his body pushed to its absolute limit. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up, as the isolation becomes overwhelming. The cyclist in the short story started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait, a small but crucial sign of civilization. The setting controls how long it takes you to get to your destination and how you get there, dictating every aspect of the journey. For example, if you come across a dirt road and there's a big boulder in the way, you have to find another, longer way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, shaping his entire experience from start to finish."
330	6308	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water, a perilous situation from the start. He is also cycling up and down curvy, hilly back roads that demand constant physical exertion. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town, each mile feeling longer than the last. He says “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him, both physically and mentally. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treacherous stretch of road, adding insult to his injury. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion, where every movement is a struggle. I can relate it to a time I played two soccer games during the summer heat; it was painful and every time I received the ball it took all I had to kick it, a small taste of the cyclist's profound fatigue.
331	6309	3	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water, a dire situation that intensified with every passing hour. He also had to manuver around a snake, a dangerous obstacle that required careful and sudden movement. It made him tired and dehydratied, sapping his remaining strength. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain, the uneven ground and sharp rocks taking a physical toll. He got dehydratied from the sun, its relentless heat baking the landscape and draining his body of essential moisture, leaving him in a precarious state.
332	6310	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because itís almost like the background and theme of the cyclist's arduous journey. The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is, painting a picture of his isolation. Heís showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much heís indespair at the time, conveying a deep sense of urgency. When he says ìIt was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.î In this quote he is saying that he may be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows heís not in a good shape and he knows heís in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do, highlighting the human spirit's resilience.
333	6311	3	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert, an environment defined by its harshness. The dessert is very hot, creating an oppressive atmosphere. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees, an almost unbearable temperature. He struggled for water but couldnít find any that was cool, his thirst growing with each failed attempt. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î This means it was hot and couldnít find water, highlighting the complete lack of viable resources in the setting that directly impacted his survival."
334	6312	3	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist throughout his challenging journey. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men, a suggestion that initially seemed promising. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy, unaware of the trials ahead. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him, its intensity becoming a central antagonist. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist, providing a brief mental respite. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more, its heat becoming unbearable. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage, a testament to his deteriorating condition. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst, ultimately succumbing to the overwhelming demands of the environment.
335	6313	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, each one presenting a new challenge to overcome. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak, his body pushed to its absolute limits. For example, the author states ìlooked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle, demonstrating his determination. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh, the mental battle becoming as difficult as the physical one. For instance in the text, ìit didnít really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.î This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough, a grim acceptance of his potential fate. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies, a powerful image of his suffering. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat, the environmental features directly causing his physical decline. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, ultimately defining the entire struggle of his journey.
336	6314	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if you are going down a hill and then hit a rough road you are not going to do so good. The sudden change in terrain can be jarring and dangerous. Like for example, he had been going on flat land, then it changed to hills, and lastly into a rough road. This progression from a smooth, manageable path to a difficult, uneven one increases the physical strain and the risk of an accident. These conditions could seriously hurt someone, especially a cyclist traveling at speed who is caught off guard by the deteriorating road surface.
337	6315	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the ghost town, since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water, which left him more isolated and vulnerable. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill, requiring greater effort and leading to quicker exhaustion. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better directions, which provided him with the essential resources and guidance he had been lacking throughout his difficult journey.
338	6316	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says, ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at me,"" pretty much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills, which demanded much more energy to traverse. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while. One example is when my friend and I went bike riding, we went to a park in Fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk up the hill, demonstrating how the terrain directly impacts a cyclist's physical capabilities."
339	6317	3	3	There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot, leading to rapid dehydration. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting him in a big way; he almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Since there was nothing around, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop, which heightened his anxiety. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time, jolting his body and slowing his progress. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remoteness of the area, and the rough road all significantly affected the cyclist on his arduous journey.
340	6318	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The harsh desert climate takes damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply, leaving him dangerously thirsty. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told him about turned out to be a ghost town, with empty buildings offering no help. This created doubt in the cyclist's mind that he might not survive the “shortcut” told of by the old men, adding a heavy psychological burden to his already difficult physical ordeal.
341	6319	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist because there are different kinds of hills, which demand varying levels of effort. He has to watch out for rocks in the middle of the road that could cause a fall. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert, a landscape devoid of natural water sources. There are no cars around, but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere on the isolated road. There are a lot of turns that require his constant attention and careful steering. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a heatstroke from the intense sun. There are no places where he can stop because there is no shade offering a moment of relief. There are no stores where he can stop and get water and food at either, leaving him completely self-reliant. That is the challenging setting of the cyclist.
342	6320	3	3	In the story, the condition of the problem often affected the mood of the cyclist, shifting it from determination to anxiety. For example, when the sign said, “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” it introduced a new layer of caution to his journey. At this time he saw a snake, and he was scared, so he eased past trying to keep balance while he was already dehydrated and weak. The dry and hot climate began to become a serious problem for the cyclist, draining his spirits as much as his physical strength.
343	6321	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, primarily through the scarcity of resources. For example, he could have tried to drink the battery-tasting water if he had no other choice, or his situation would have worsened if he didn't get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on a long-distance journey, with no water or any other supplies, is very energy-consuming and physically demanding. So you have to plan trips like that very wisely, considering the harsh and isolated environment. This careful planning is essential for survival and success on such a demanding route.
344	6322	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist, presenting a series of interconnected challenges. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the “beautiful @DATE1,” where the sun beats down relentlessly. He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him as dehydration sets in. But that’s not the worst of it; the steep hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker, compounding his physical strain. There are also no places to stop for water, no shops or shelters along the rugged path. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California, a testament to his endurance against the oppressive setting.
345	6323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, defining the difficulties he encounters. If he wasn’t in the “High deserts of California in June” he probably wouldn't be dehydrated; if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn't be so hot out, offering a more forgiving climate. Also, if there weren’t “short rolling hills” he would have had more energy, as the constant climbing is exhausting. As you can see, the specific elements of the setting affect the cyclist a lot, directly influencing his physical state and the overall challenge of his ride.
346	6324	3	3	There were many features that affect the cyclist, creating a series of difficult obstacles throughout his journey. Lack of water slowed him down considerably, forcing him to conserve his remaining energy. Also the hills and sun were a big problem, with the steep inclines demanding great physical effort and the relentless sun causing significant dehydration. These combined environmental factors ultimately made his progress slow and arduous.
347	6325	3	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,” the features of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist, directly shaping his difficult experience. The roads were bumpy, windy, and featured many hills, which made the ride physically taxing. As the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water to combat his mounting thirst and fatigue. As the cyclist rode into the so called town he found nothing to relieve his suffering, as he says “I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water,"" leaving him without a viable source of refreshment. This disappointment highlighted the harsh reality of his surroundings."
348	6326	3	3	The way the features of the setting effect the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up. The intense heat radiating from the pavement and the sun beating down caused her to sweat profusely, rapidly depleting her body's water reserves. The steep, long climb on the challenging road required immense physical exertion, which only accelerated her dehydration. This combination of environmental and physical demands significantly hindered her progress and well-being on the journey.
349	6327	3	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride, feeling strong and prepared. But after he left first town he had been riding for a long time and desperately needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid, leaving him still thirsty. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him, pushing him to his physical limits. Then as he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store, a sight that brought him immense relief. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map, finally securing the aid he needed. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end of his arduous trek.
350	6328	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay entitled “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in an tagonizing manner, testing his endurance to its very limit. He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in, a barren and unforgiving landscape. the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert, which created a constant, oppressive demand for fluids. He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids, leaving him weak and disoriented. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved, further draining his already depleted strength. Therefore the cyclist became so exausted that he almost died, a clear testament to the severe impact of his surroundings. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him so profoundly.
351	6329	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confident, determined, and relieved. For example, he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up, lost on a remote and unfamiliar road. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go, believing their advice would lead him correctly, and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time, showing a return of self-assurance. He was also determined because he wanted to get to the next town, which he does, pushing through his fatigue and thirst, and that achievement also makes him relieved, renewing his desire to ultimately get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting, through its challenges and occasional guidance, profoundly affects the cyclist's emotional state throughout his journey.
352	6330	3	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist finds himself change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine and manageable, so he becomes confident and optimistic about his ride. When the terrain began to change, becoming harsh and unforgiving, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” and he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water, feeling completely worn down. When he begins to see a building in the distance, he becomes hopeful and determined, pedaling harder toward what he believes is salvation. However, when he realizes it's an old, deserted juice factory, he grows bitter and disappointed at the false promise. When he leaves the factory, he feels he has lost all hope, a sentiment captured when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" At the end, when he is revived with water at a small store, he almost looks back on the journey comically, recognizing the absurdity of his suffering. The rider knows that his outlook drastically changed depending on the setting through his journey, from hope to despair and back again."
353	6331	3	3	The features of California and the fact that the cyclist was near Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous for him. California has a very hot, arid climate and is near a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater than if he had been cycling in a cooler, more temperate location. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a severely limited water supply, which intensified his physical struggle. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “short, rolling hills,” which would have made it harder to pedal, forcing him to work harder and expend more energy. In the story, he also mentions how the sun was beating down on him relentlessly, and that would also serve as a major factor that helped deplete his hydration rapidly. Through all of the problems the cyclist faced, however, he managed to stay determined and persevere, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you notice that in the different stages of his struggle, the author's tone and anger shift from confident, to unsure, to desperate, mirroring the harsh landscape's impact on his mental state.
354	6332	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, primarily through its physical demands. It made him tired from the long, arduous ride, thirsty under the relentless sun, and he was near exhaustion from the constant effort required to traverse the difficult terrain. The harsh, unshaded environment and the vast, empty distances between points of respite drained his energy and tested his limits. This physical toll imposed by the setting was a constant challenge throughout his journey, shaping his entire experience from start to finish.
355	6333	3	3	The cyclist in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to the national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here, rendering their directions nearly useless. The first town he came upon was deserted, a realistic version of a ghost town that offered no help. He laughed bitterly at how long ago those men must have been here, realizing the advice was a relic of the past. Long hours on the hot road and with depleted water supplies led to despair sinking in deeply. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory, seeing it as another symbol of his failed detour. Ultimately, he had made it to a bait store for water at last, a moment of profound relief. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again, having learned a hard lesson about trusting outdated information over reliable tools.
356	6334	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by letting the author have hope, which is quickly challenged by the harsh environment. When he came across a sign which read ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" his hope was faint because he was doing a water-depleting twenty miles per hour. Because of the rapid rate of the water loss, he felt life was cruel sometimes and he thought that he was at the point of losing all his water. Also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them, navigating carefully past the obstacles. If he would have been bitten he would have died, a constant danger in such a remote place. Finally because of the heat he might have also died from heatstroke, with wide signs of dried sweat marking his clothing and skin. Ultimately, the setting presented a series of severe trials that pushed him to his absolute limit."
357	6335	3	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many features of the setting challenge the cyclist. The cyclist accepts information from foreign old people which made his first mistake, leading him onto a difficult path. After realizing this, he notes, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California, in June.” The lack of water plus the intense heat in California in June would have turned to heatstroke for most people, creating a dire situation. Even further into the journey, even with all those things against him it states, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" so not only did he have excessive heat and no water, but he was handed troublesome roads too, adding physical strain. Although the cyclist must have been near to complete exhaustion, he continued through, pushing forward with immense effort. Fighting all odds and elements, many features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist, but he overcame them honorably through sheer determination and willpower."
358	6336	3	3	"The dry desert-like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on, fighting through the weakness. The terrain went from being flat to short rolling hills, increasing the physical challenge. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water but finding none. The man goes on to say, “I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me"" (Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviously desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty, with very little shade or respite. This would definitely have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss, draining his energy reserves. In conclusion, the cyclist was greatly affected by the setting, which tested his physical endurance and mental resolve at every turn."
359	6337	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist quite drastically. First of all, he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” a time of extreme heat. He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced “brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid,” making it undrinkable. Then he came upon “rolling hills” and “Rough Road,” which demanded more from his tired body. By the end, he was exhausted, dehydrated, and in desperate need of water, his condition worsening with each mile. The terrain made the story more meaningful in proving that you shouldn’t get directions from old guys, a hard-learned lesson about preparation and trusting unreliable advice.
360	6338	3	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider, demanding constant hydration. Water is necessary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated, but his supply was critically low. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terrains, a route fraught with difficulty. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal, accelerating his physical decline. For example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" The author, by using vocabulary such as ""tantalizing,"" expresses the cyclist's desperate need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator makes a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for suggesting the path. Readers can also conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist, shaping his difficult and perilous journey."
361	6339	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water, leaving his bottles empty. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition, being cracked and full of potholes. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water after a long and arduous struggle.
362	6340	3	3	"The story ""Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was determined by the setting as well as his needs and his determination to make it. The setting of the story is early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them, feeling misled by their suggested shortcut. Also as the difficulty increased his determination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" Ultimately for the cyclist, the setting's affect was negative, testing his physical and mental limits."
363	6341	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” there are many features that affected the cyclist. For example, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” they were starting to get hot, than tired from the relentless heat. Than when he came to all the bumps in the road, it was harder to pedal, jolting his bike and straining his muscles. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard, quickly depleting his supply. So that means he's hot getting tired and lost. “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” That is telling us he’s working too hard, than he’ll be worn out to ride, completely exhausted by the effort. Those are reason's why features affected the cyclist throughout his challenging journey.
364	6342	3	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a “shortcut” that will take him right to his destination, but which instead leads him into a more difficult and isolated area. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway, which tested his endurance and resolve. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination, pushing through the fatigue and the misleading advice he had received.
365	6343	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in a cooler location in the middle of June he wouldn’t of gotten so dehydrated and exhausted. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to extreme degrees of heat. In the middle of summer in a more temperate place it barely reaches such high temperatures. Also the desert is know to have nothing, no shops or people for miles. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station or a store to replenish his water. Although this cyclist is riding in “No Man’s Land,” a completely desolate area. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really complains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels, making the path even more treacherous for a lone cyclist.
366	6344	3	3	"The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult, described as ""long"" and ""crippling"" as he struggled to climb them. It says, “over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.” This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling, draining his energy with each arduous pedal stroke. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.” The sight of this derelict factory, a place that once produced drink, only emphasized his current state of thirst and disappointment. These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist, demonstrating how the physical landscape directly challenged his resolve and physical state."
367	6345	3	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply, a situation that quickly becomes perilous. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly, intensifying his anxiety. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert, a direct consequence of the isolated, unfamiliar environment. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, finding a crucial, life-saving respite within the setting, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite, his journey profoundly shaped by the desert's harsh demands.
368	6346	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt, presenting a constant physical danger. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid, showing how the available resources were tainted and unpalatable. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him, testing his endurance further. The setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake, adding an element of wildlife threat to the desolate landscape. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists, playing tricks on his mind due to heat and exhaustion. That’s how the setting affects the cyclists through a combination of physical obstacles and psychological strain.
369	6347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels, immersed in an environment of extreme heat. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke,” highlighting the sheer danger of his undertaking. @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier,” a clear sign of his deteriorating condition. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in, creating an overwhelming sense of struggle against an unforgiving natural world.
370	6348	3	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which ear him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along, marking a drastic and challenging shift in the day's conditions. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey, terrain that demands greater physical effort and saps his strength. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through, painting a vivid picture of his arduous struggle against the elements. The cumulative effect of the heat and the difficult landscape is a central force shaping his entire experience.
371	6349	3	3	In the article “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” the features of the setting took a toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off, the whole setting was a dry, dusty, and desolate desert that would wear anybody down. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The sun affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which brings me to the next point. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory, a sight that was both ironic and crushing. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end, the harsh features of the setting only made him more determined to reach his goal, forging his resolve in the crucible of the desert.
372	6350	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way was the weather. In the story it said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote confirms he is in a desert, and deserts are usually warm. It also said in June, and June is usually a hot temperature month. The weather affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water left in his bottles. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the surroundings. In the story it said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.” That emphasizes there was no one around to help him, so if he gets hurt or something happens, he is completely alone. Also, there is nowhere to get some water, amplifying his isolation and vulnerability in the vast, empty landscape.
373	6351	3	3	"Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” This passage suggests blistering heat; ""high"" meaning it is going to be closer to the sun, ""deserts"" where the world is hot, ""California,"" which is known to be smoggy, and ""June,"" which is the middle of summer. Also, the closest water supply was described as being “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was beating down. All of that would most obviously affect the cyclist by making him exhausted and weary, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing consciousness and succumbing to the oppressive conditions of his journey."
374	6352	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This affects the cyclist because it makes him work harder when he is already dying of thirst, especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and uses his remaining strength more rapidly. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says it was “in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting frustrated and there is no cold water. This affects the cyclist by making him think only about water and not bothering to think about where he is; he could be lost, a fear compounded by the fact that he didn’t have a good map to guide him.
375	6353	3	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, there were the old men he knew he shouldn’t have trusted but did anyway. This misplaced trust led him through the harsh desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse, knowing that if you run out of water no one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a role in the cyclist's feelings of hopelessness. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandoned towns and spoiled water sources. Every time he thought he was saved he was let down again by that disappointing fact. For example, he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally, just when his strength was about to give out, he found the bait shop and water, a dramatic turn that offered a place to rest, too bad there was another old man there, isn’t it?!
376	6354	3	3	In the essay, the features of the cyclist affect the setting because the readers wouldn't have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadn't of been going through the harsh desert environment. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost completely dehydrated, showing his dire state. And then when he finally got to the bait shop he drank desperately from the faucet, which highlights how the arid setting intensified his physical crisis. The setting's severity is thus defined by the cyclist's escalating struggle.
377	6355	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly. For instance, the terrain consisted of rolling hills that went up and down continuously, and it took a lot of strength to navigate them. Furthermore, he barely had any water because it was so intensely hot that he kept drinking and consequently ran out of water early in his journey. In the story it says when he was riding that “He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.” This quote shows it was starting to get dangerously hot. Also, in the story he says “I checked my water supply,” which clearly means he’s starting to realize his water is running short and he is becoming concerned. So in all, the setting is hot, abandoned, and there's no available water source, so the cyclist is being profoundly affected by all of these challenging environmental factors.
378	6356	3	3	The setting was an important factor in the story. It was a desert, and in a desert there is a severe lack of water and intense heat. The protagonist was on a bike, which is a dangerous mode of transport in such conditions. This is because you are using your feet to move, which takes out a great deal of energy and uses up the precious water from your body through sweat. The combination of physical exertion and a resource-scarce environment creates a serious threat to survival. Therefore, the desert setting directly creates the central conflict and peril for the character.
379	6357	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist profoundly because he was biking up steep hills in extreme, relentless heat. This physical exertion was compounded by the fact that he also had a short water supply, which was rapidly depleting. To make matters worse, he was headed in the wrong direction, further extending his exposure to the hazardous environment. These combined factors of difficult terrain, scorching temperature, limited resources, and navigational error placed the cyclist in a critically vulnerable position, demonstrating the powerful influence of the setting on his journey.
380	6358	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several key ways. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly man were incorrect, and as a result, he got lost and his journey was prolonged. The pervasive lack of water in the environment led to the possibility of him sucking pebbles to generate saliva and forget about his overwhelming thirst. Additionally, the constant rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy and become fatigued much more quickly. These were the significant effects the setting had on the cyclist, each element contributing to his overall hardship and danger.
381	6359	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly, shaping her emotional state throughout the journey. When she biked around a bend, the landscape opened up into a beautiful, serene vista, and in that moment, she felt a profound sense of relief, as ìmy troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.î The change in scenery provided a mental escape, proving how the physical environment can directly influence a rider's internal experience and offer a reprieve from hardship. This demonstrates the powerful connection between a cyclist's surroundings and their psychological well-being, concluding that the setting is a crucial element in any journey.
382	6360	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist set out on a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he was staying he met some old people who gave him a ìshort cut.î As he found out, most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water, leaving him increasingly desperate. If he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that, or even if he was in a more populated, industrialized area he could stop in any building and ask for a drink. But he was in the dry, hot, abandoned hills of California without any water, a setting that offered no such relief. Under these conditions he grew tired, thirsty, dehydrated, and desperate for a drink until he finally came upon a bait shop that had water there, ending his immediate physical crisis.
383	6361	3	3	During the cyclist's journey he was affected by the setting frequently, with the environmental conditions directly impacting his physical state. When he was cycling it became very hot to him, but at first it wasnít so bad, as he notes, ìThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.î This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not initially affect him significantly. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was traveling in, specifically the season and location, as he states, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high deserts in California in June.î This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out, showing his body's heightened demand for water. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his trip, dictating his needs and actions throughout the ride.
384	6362	3	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain which can pose different challenges. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if itís bumpy then someone could fall off the bike, leading to potential injury. Also, if it is dark you might not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt yourself very seriously, which is why riding a bike can be dangerous under poor conditions. Also, if you're in the type of environment where everything is smooth then you might be able to have a nice bike ride without such risks. Therefore, the safety and quality of a bike ride are fundamentally tied to the characteristics of its setting.
385	6363	3	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, ìDo not Exceed posted speed Limit,î by changing him physically and mentally. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left, and this harsh environment was taking a significant physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well, as he says, ìIt was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example a cooler, forested region, where it does not get nearly as hot so soon as California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, nor would he have been in such an isolated place. His cycling ordeal could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in the mountains. Instead of dehydration and heat stroke, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was ultimately determined by their setting, proving environment is a powerful force in any narrative."
386	6364	3	3	The harsh conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the intense heat and the unforgiving features of the setting were so severe he felt completely defeated. This is evident when the cyclist thinks he can only hope to make it to the horizon because there is nothing else to compare it to. He cannot tell himself to ride to the next building or a distant mail box because there are simply none in the vast emptiness. The desert's desolate features make the cyclist feel profoundly alone, convinced that no one can help him and that he will inevitably die of dyhydration. Then, the features deliver a cruel blow when he sees the Welch's grape fruit juice building, which gives him a small, fleeting hope of survival, only for him to find out that it is completely deserted. This discovery feels like the final straw, and he completely gives up. The cyclist, now almost unconscious from exhaustion and despair, then stumbles into a fishing store where he finally has a life-saving sip of water. Ultimately, the geographical features were the main reason the cyclist lost all hope of surviving his journey.
387	6365	3	3	The features of the setting affect the author because it physically moves him toward a state of severe dehydration. The relentless desert sun seemed to sweat every last drop of moisture out of him, and he had no supply of water to bring that would adequately replace his lost electrolites. Also, once the author had got into the rolling hills he had lost a great deal of his energy, so peddling up the steep inclines was a tremendous amount of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten incredibly tired because you simply need water in your body to survive, and the setting provided none.
388	6366	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly, both physically and mentally. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well, as he embarked with a positive attitude which is stated as being “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts, a sight he found troubling and ominous. Though troubling, he still had the residual confidence that he could continue his journey. Next he keenly noticed the significant changes in the terrain, explaining that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This shift meant that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over each challenging hill. The weather was not helping, growing increasingly hot as the cyclist was running dangerously out of water, and the real possibility of heatstroke came to his mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”, as told by the man, emphasizing his isolation. His mind then entered a deep state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he tried to persevere and cycled on. At this critical point he was very thirsty and felt with certainty that his death was near, thinking “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” As he kept going, he suddenly spotted an old guy in the distance, which made him regain a spark of hope and move ahead. The features of this story thus affected the cyclist in a dual manner. Physically he was tired and worn out from the exertion, and in a like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his entire travel. The setting's features directly interfered with the cyclist's physical endurance and mental state throughout his arduous trip.
389	6367	3	3	In this story, “No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, I believe the setting greatly affects the cyclist's experience and morale. I believe this because when the route consists of long, downhill cool roads the journey is fine, but if it is straight uphill roads under an extremely hot sun he feels like he simply cannot keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no other people around, feeling the immense solitude and heat, so the setting has a huge affect on the overall mood in this story. Another example is the sheer monotony of the landscape, which drains his spirit as much as the heat drains his body, showing how deeply the environment influences his struggle.
390	6368	3	3	A cyclist is fundamentally a bike rider, dedicated to their sport or mode of travel. They can be in groups of diffrent people, riding together for camaraderie, or they can be a solo cyclist tackling the road alone. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes, a short recreational trip, while some can go for more like one hundred miles, embarking on epic journeys. Some go over formidable hills, go trow bodies of water, and navigate various terrains; they do alot with what they do, requiring significant planning and effort. They inevitably have alot of time on there hands to ride a bike that far, which demands both physical stamina and mental fortitude for such long-distance endeavors.
391	6369	3	3	The setting is oppressively hot, resembling a desert, with no one around and a very dry atmosphere. The intense heat outside directly affects the cyclist, making him sweaty and creating a desperate need for water. The relentless sun wears him down, sapping his energy with each passing mile. The profound isolation, with no one around, causes him to be unable to get the water which he critically needs for his journey. These combined factors make him weak and significantly complicate his efforts to find a place to get water, extending his suffering. Ultimately, the harsh environment proves to be a formidable adversary in his travels.
392	6370	3	3	The setting can affect the cyclist because it could be a good or a bad thing for his journey. If a cyclist is able to adjust his own settings, such as his pace or route, that is good for maintaining control. However, if somebody else messes with them, perhaps by providing faulty information or tampering with his equipment, that could be bad and lead to difficulties. This dynamic shows how external interference, versus personal management, can alter the outcome of his ride. Therefore, the cyclist's experience is heavily dependent on who controls the variables of his trip.
393	6371	3	3	"In this narrative of a cyclist riding in California and headed for Yosemite National Park, he encounters a severe lack of water and receives bad directions from a group of old men on a porch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge,"" from the initial pine trees to the later barren hills. In the beginning of his trip he passes a ""ghost town"" that has clearly seen better days, which presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then he sees the pines that, as he felt, ""had my name written all over them,"" which gives him hope and reassurance. Then the discovery of a rusty pump and a ""ramshackle shed"" took that hope and reassurance away, making him cautious once more. The steep hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down, and the abandoned Welch's juice company all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he finally got some water at a roadside bathroom and his situation was all better. If the setting had been less varied the whole way, he wouldn't have had any hope or his hope would not have fallen and risen, making the story far less interesting and dynamic for the reader."
394	6372	3	3	Winding hills, limited water, and poor directions are the primary troubles of this cyclist. First, he gets very bad directions from a group of old men who have not been outside of their porch in a while, leading him astray from the start. Then he goes through the first town and makes the crucial mistake of not filling his water bottles while he has the chance. Consequently, he gets lost and runs out of water, putting him in a precarious situation. His luck changes when he finds a fishing store where there is water available and people who give him a better, more reliable map for the remainder of his journey. This final assistance provides him with the means to continue his trip successfully.
395	6373	3	3	"The lack of water, and the absence of reliable direction, severely effects the cyclist. Water effects the cyclist because he said in the essay “I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie), highlighting the immediate physical danger. Also, having no direction is another big problem he faces. It is important because without proper direction he is going to be riding for a long time, potentially getting more lost and exhausting his limited resources. In conclusion, the dual challenges of dehydration and navigational confusion were the cyclist's central problems in the story, each compounding the other to create a significant ordeal."
396	6374	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist because he mistakenly thought he had packed enough water. Confidently, he began on his way, but he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn’t realize how intensely hot the arid landscape was until he got down to his last couple of sips. As he started to become dehydrated, he remembered the old men had said that the next town was about eighteen miles away, so he kept on going. His hope faded when he reached the town, finding nothing to drink, just an old run down factory. Desperate, he took some rocks and sucked on them for moisture, but when he went over a bump, he accidentally swallowed one. He said to himself that next time he would just go by what the map said, as everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finally, he reached a bait shop and went inside to the bathroom, where he was able to get some water and end his ordeal.
397	6375	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. For example, it was not just the heat but also the steep hill that contributed to him becoming dehydrated, sapping his energy as he climbed. He went down a rusty-bumpy road, which didn't help his dehydration, jostling him and making his journey more arduous. And another example would be when he found a vantage point from which he could assess a change in the terrain and find the best way to get where he was going. This demonstrates that the features of the setting had a significant effect on the cyclist and his decisions throughout the ride.
398	6376	3	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all, he rides into barren land, a desolate expanse with little life. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This was in response to the first “town” he came across, which was empty and crumbling. Next, he speaks of a large snake that came close to him, which was dangerous, but luckily he maneuvers out of its way, his heart pounding from the scare. But the worst setting the cyclist had to deal with was the pervasive lack of water, a severe threat to any living creature. His thirst became all-consuming, but in the end, he found some water and the story ended fine, providing a welcome relief from the harsh journey.
399	6377	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting relates directly to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town,” he is not too worried about it and moves on, noting, “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right then, and still has enough water to feel secure. Next, he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter and more oppressive. He observes, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” From that point, as the author is low on water, the day seems worse. Afterward, he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even more panicked, describing “a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Later, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink, things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the intense heat. As a result, the description of the setting was clearly related to the author’s shifting moods throughout his difficult trip.
400	6378	3	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story, the setting is a hot, dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California, evoking images of a vast desert. This heat of the desert climate seems to start having an effect on him about after he reaches the first ghost town. I know this by his statement: “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last war—but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down.” The summer heat is thriving now during this season and he is drinking lots of water, noting how quickly his supply diminishes. So this setting does affect him greatly; it causes him to use his water supply rapidly and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration, a dangerous situation. I know how the summer heat can affect you during strenuous activities; at times it feels like you are going to die, but that hopeful building is always just around the bend for the determined cyclist, offering a promise of respite.
401	6379	3	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclist's condition. ""CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with, given the relentless sun and arid landscape. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, and it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of helping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town,” being utterly desolate and abandoned, and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water, which is completely undrinkable. Therefore, the oppressive heat is only made worse by the lack of usable water on the cyclist's path. This combination of features in the setting causes a great deal of distress to the cyclist, severely depleting his energy and resolve and almost pushing him to death from exhaustion and dehydration."
402	6380	3	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story, such as the weather, the supply of food and water, a wrong estimation for old people, and the road. First off, the weather was very dry and it felt like two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat profusely and made it hard to breathe in the thick, hot air. The supply of water was harsh, with not much around at all, and when he tried to get water the pumps would pump out anything but clean water, yielding only useless, hot liquid. The weather and water supply were two major affects on the cyclist, combining to create a truly desperate and life-threatening situation for him on his journey.
403	6381	3	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face"" (NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there, feeling optimistic and free. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her, filled with a sense of invincibility. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” (NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things, a place of eerie silence and emptiness, the author hears people! She is extremely relieved to have found anyone of help to her, a feeling of salvation washing over her. She gets water and is forever grateful for this simple, life-saving act. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you can't survive even if you live there, creating a profound sense of isolation and vulnerability. She felt alone and that she would die, a fear that was entirely shaped by the desolate landscape. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water, but the utter remoteness of her actual location stripped away all such comfort."
404	6382	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist, primarily for two reasons concerning the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water supply, which he had carefully refilled all the way up, quickly cooled down and became insufficient under the harsh sun, failing to provide the needed relief. My last reason is because of the rolling hills, which demanded constant physical exertion, relentlessly draining his stamina as he pedaled up and down their slopes. Together, these two elements of the environment created a formidable challenge that severely tested the cyclist's endurance on his journey.
405	6383	3	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, “short, rolling hills,” and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere, a profoundly isolating feeling. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride, pushing the body to its absolute limits. Not to mention there isn’t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing, leaving only despair. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble, creating a situation where survival itself becomes the primary and most difficult challenge.
406	6384	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in desperate need of a water supply, the cyclist found a rusty pipe from which a foul, tar-like substance initially came out, followed by a trickle of brackish water that was undrinkable. While cycling, you are in need of clean water, and this failed source was a profound disappointment. Next, the terrain changed abruptly from being flat to very hilly, demanding greater physical exertion. In need of water, the last thing you need is to be challenged more by such an arduous landscape. Later on down the road, there were no cars or any buildings in sight, amplifying the sense of desolation. When you are feeling the worst, you would want someone to be near in case you fall out, but no one was in sight on that lonely, empty road. Lastly, seeing the old Welch's Grape Juice Factory would profoundly affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right in front of you, a place that should have been an oasis but where no business was conducted, had to make them feel like he/she will never make it through this ordeal. These distinct features of the setting collectively had a significant and negative affect on the cyclist's morale and physical state.
407	6385	3	3	The features in the setting dramatically affect the cyclist. Everything was fine and the ride was manageable until he ran out of water and reached the daunting, unending hills. Now if he was in a different, more forgiving location, he wouldn't have become so severely dehydrated. But the hills, with their steep and constant grades, were sure to play with his mind, creating a mental battle alongside the physical one. The most important setting is the Welch's grape juice factory, which stands as a cruel landmark. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted to quench his powerful thirst, but it was abandoned and provided no relief, an ironic twist as he calls it. And the last one is the bait shop that saves his life, where a kindly old man finally appears and offers him the crucial directions he needs to find civilization. This final feature provides the turning point that the other harsh settings had made so necessary.
408	6386	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was isolated in the middle of no-where with no available water or a sense of direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle; he began to get very thirsty and fatigued. I found an example in the text to show that he was thirsty and struggling: “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1, he was indicating he was getting very exhausted and he desperately needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refuge or source of help was located. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that far in his current state. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot, for the most part eroding his confidence and hope.
409	6387	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the stark desert and has a severe lack of water, a basic necessity for survival. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time, but his situation is far more extreme. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add to the story by providing local, if dated, advice. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible, leading him further into difficulty. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about the drink he cannot have. The sign showing grape juice looks irresistible to him in his parched state and drives him to keep forward in a desperate search for anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now, expending precious energy, rather than just ride on flat terrain where the going was easier.
410	6388	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the intense heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster, sapping his strength. The relentless heat made him drink more frequently so he ran out of his water supply more quickly than anticipated. Then he would try and conserve his remaining water by not drinking, and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was still losing body fluid in sweat from the exertion. Secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use significantly more energy and leg power to cycle up the slopes. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land, compounding his fatigue. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert environment, the cyclist would not have become as severely dehydrated and tired as he did during this challenging journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, both through the environmental heat and the demanding topography.
411	6389	3	3	The features of the setting directly affect the cyclist, primarily through the intense heat and lack of water. The statement, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” highlights the extreme environmental conditions. The June heat in the desert is oppressive, accelerating dehydration and forcing the cyclist to consume his water supply rapidly. His physical exertion from cycling uses energy and produces sweat, further increasing his need for hydration. The description of the location, “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule,” confirms the desolation and absence of a viable water source. This inability to renew his water means he must conserve what little he has left, which in turn forces him to limit his energy expenditure. Both of these factors—the scorching desert heat and the complete absence of water—combine to create a setting that affects the cyclist far more severely than cycling on a cold day would.
412	6390	3	3	The cyclist in the narrative is profoundly affected by the features of the setting, which create a sense of physical and psychological distress. The extremely hot weather is a primary factor, as such intense heat induces exhaustion and a feeling of being completely drained of energy. Furthermore, the complete absence of other people contributes to a feeling of isolation. Being entirely alone in a vast, empty landscape can make a person feel small, helpless, and vulnerable, much like the common fear associated with solitude. Finally, the critical lack of available water in the surroundings intensifies her suffering. The author’s description clearly conveys a state of severe thirst, and the barren environment, offering no hope of relief, makes the sensation of thirst feel even more acute and inescapable.
413	6391	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist through several distinct physical challenges. The rough roads directly impact his journey, making pedaling difficult and physically taxing as he navigates the uneven terrain. An encounter with a snake introduces a moment of fear and danger during his ride through the desolate “town,” breaking his concentration and adding a psychological hurdle. The dwindling supply of drinkable water is another critical factor; not only is he running out, but the water he does manage to find is so contaminated it tastes like battery acid, rendering it undrinkable and worsening his predicament. Ultimately, the cumulative hardships presented by the setting prove to be very rough on the cyclist, testing his endurance at every turn.
414	6392	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tired, scared, thirsty, and causing him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June, and the cyclist was riding through the intense heat over hills and difficult terrain. He describes the changing land, noting, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” and later speaks of going, “Over one long, crippling hill.” As the cyclist progresses, his doubt grows. Fear and thirst begin to overwhelm him, leading to the despairing thought, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When he finally finds the bait shop, he has almost lost all hope, a feeling captured in his observation of “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” However, at the very end, the setting enables a reversal as the sight of the bait shop makes the cyclist regain his strength; he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” Thus, the features of the setting put the cyclist through an unsteady ride of fear, hope, and ultimately, restored confidence.
415	6393	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by ultimately providing him with the water he desperately needs for his thirst. This crucial resource allows him to recover and get back on the road to continue toward his destination. However, a minor inconsistency arises as the narrative does not mention him actually obtaining any bait for fishing, which is suggested by the location being a bait shop. The cyclist was also profoundly affected by the harsh conditions of the setting prior to this point, as he nearly died from a combination of extreme thirst and the apparent lack of a clear, traversable road. The setting, therefore, presents both the crisis and the eventual solution for the weary traveler.
416	6394	3	3	He raced through the rugged terrain, trying to get to Yosemite for some whitewater rafting on the rushing river. The path was steep and littered with loose stones, challenging his endurance with every turn. His lungs burned with the thin mountain air as he pushed forward, the sound of the churning water a constant, motivating roar in the distance. He knew that reaching the river’s edge would make the entire grueling journey worthwhile, offering a moment of cool respite and thrilling adventure. With one final, strenuous push over a rocky crest, he finally saw the magnificent, frothing water ahead, a triumphant end to his difficult race.
417	6395	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Having desert races makes you want to just lay there and not try to go any further, because you don’t know where an end will be, the vast emptiness sapping your will. As for grassy, flowery land, its more of a scenic route, and makes you want to keep going and see many things, with each new bend promising another pleasant vista. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but present more of a challenge, and a good workout at the same time, testing both physical strength and mental resolve. Each type of landscape imposes its own unique psychological and physical demands on the rider. Ultimately, the setting does profoundly affect the cyclist, shaping the entire experience of the journey.
418	6396	3	3	When the cyclist first receives directions to Yosemite Park from the “old timers” he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” feeling optimistic and energetic. As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind, a silence that grows increasingly unnerving. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land, the isolation becoming palpable. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting, each pedal stroke a new struggle. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating, his initial energy completely spent. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” a stark vision of his desperation. It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” saved the cyclist from almost certain death and taught him to always just use his map from that day forward.
419	6397	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit,” the features of the area the cyclist rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path,” the mundane sight underscores a growing monotony and fatigue. The tone of the cyclist from the quote above shows despair creeping into his mind as the journey wears on. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “Over the next hill, a building came into view,” a simple line that carries immense weight. The cyclist sounds more hopeful than before, his spirits lifted by the promise of civilization or respite. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him, directly influencing his emotional state and outlook.
420	6398	3	3	In the story the cyclist is affected by many features of the desert. The main feature is the relentless, oppressive heat. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” a simple statement that conveys the severity of his undertaking. He’s also running low on water, a critical resource, noting “The water bottles only contained a few tantalizing sips,” which only heightened his anxiety. He’s faced by extreme heat and lack of water, a dangerous combination that begins to take its toll. He’s tired and has a long way to go, the endless landscape offering no comfort. So far, all of the towns have been deserted, ghostly places that provide no relief. Finally he reaches a bait shop and his luck changes, as he refills his water and, shaken by the ordeal, promised to stick to the map in the future.
421	6399	3	3	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist in different ways. For example, the course must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads, which made his journey physically grueling. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across, adding a layer of constant peril to his ride. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist, shaping both his physical state and his overall experience on the challenging route.
422	6400	3	3	The terrain described in this essay adds affect to the struggles of the cyclist. For example when the author says “there were no cars nor buildings in sight” that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere, emphasizing his profound isolation. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandoned juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva, a desperate act highlighting his extreme need. Also when he finally finds water an “oldtimer” asks if he knows the best way to go, introducing an element of uncertainty into his difficult journey.
423	6401	3	3	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it’s June and that causes a lot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afraid of getting dehydrated, a constant and pressing concern. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was losing more water through increased exertion and sweat. The combination of the relentless heat and the demanding terrain created a cycle of physical hardship that was difficult for him to overcome.
424	6402	3	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first “town”, he could tell there’d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area with no signs of life to offer help. The water was hot, providing little relief from the oppressive conditions. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills, increasing the physical difficulty of his ride. There was a big snake in the road, presenting a direct danger. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water, showing how the landscape itself contributed to his deteriorating condition.
425	6403	3	3	I think it explains because they did a good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did the same thing wrong too, creating a confusing outcome. The overall effort was therefore mixed, with both positive and negative aspects that are difficult to reconcile.
426	6404	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist. Dehydration caused by the intense heat and a lack of sufficient water caused the cyclist to sweat excessively and to feel nauseous. The author describes how “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh.” In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in a bad state, pushed to his physical limits by the harsh environment. The relentless sun and the arid landscape work in tandem to create a dangerous situation for the rider. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting, particularly the extreme heat, affects the cyclist, threatening his well-being and challenging his endurance.
427	6405	3	3	"The environmental features affect the cyclist in a big way, creating a series of compounding challenges. For one, the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired,"" sapping his energy over the long miles. The heat had also made him desperately thirsty which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time, so he ran out of water long before reaching the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert meant there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in, leaving him fully exposed to the elements. There were also no people around to help him or give him water, intensifying his isolation. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could, as the setting presented one obstacle after another without reprieve."
428	6406	3	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the critical lack of water. He notes that “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” highlighting that water is of big importance to a person. Your body needs water to work right, and without it, the body begins to fail. The humid, dry weather of California was a major affect too, as he was cycling through “The high deserts of California in June.” The thought that “I could drop from a heatstroke” was a real danger. The sun is unbearable, especially without shade and water, and this has a major affect on the cyclist. The presence of animals was another factor, and “There was No-one in sight.” It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if a store or people would have been around, but instead the exact company is the animals. He encounters “A large snake crossed my path,” and specifically a “diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement.” It would have been stressful to worry about those things, and these are all things that significantly affect the cyclist during his arduous journey.
429	6407	3	3	Rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts—all are features of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist on his journey. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end, constantly battling against gravity on the ascents. The open terrain leads directly to the beating sun which also puts immense pressure on the cyclist, offering no shelter from the relentless heat. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for miles on end in rough, dry terrain, putting strain on him overall as he fights for every inch of progress. Each geographical feature presents its own unique physical demand, combining to create an exhausting and grueling trip.
430	6408	3	3	In the case of the cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting has an enormous affect on the biker. Predominantly, the weather causes him to feel severely dehydrated. He says that he “had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This is demonstrated when he tries to get water from an old well, showing just how much he needed water. The water in this pump, the owner said, was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infers that it must be intensely hot outside; the author implied this when he says he is in California in June, it is a scorching day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lone, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a large affect on the cyclist. As he begins to see how hopeless his situation is, he cannot see any signs of modern life; “there was no one in sight, not a building car or structure of any kind.” This empty land makes the cyclist himself feel empty and utterly alone. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lost and aching, defeated by the unfamiliar and unforgiving landscape.
431	6409	3	3	There were many different conditions that affected the cyclist throughout his arduous journey. He did not have the proper amount of water for the journey, which made it incredibly difficult to maintain his stamina. He states in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Furthermore, the challenging terrain and steep hills made it difficult to maintain a steady pace. He ran into snakes and traversed very deserted country, feeling entirely alone. But his unwavering determination ultimately led to success, and he finally arrived into a town, where he could find respite.
432	6410	3	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, shaping his emotional state and resolve. When he arrives in the first “town” that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist “chuckled and moved on”, and acted just sort of indifferent, to seeing this old, dilapidated town. As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deteriorating, so he became a bit uneasy and concerned. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, worn out, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these desolate places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water, continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely, mirroring the cyclist's own trials."
433	6411	3	3	Some features of the environment can significantly affect the cyclist during a ride. The weather can slow them down; for instance, if it was extremely cold or hot outside, it can slow the person down and drain their energy. If the person does not have adequate protection from the elements, such as proper clothing or sufficient hydration, the journey can become far more challenging and potentially unsafe, ultimately impacting their overall performance and ability to continue.
434	6412	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist primarily by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and where trees had fallen all across the road, creating obstacles. The road itself was like a snake because it was waved with curves, and it had a huge hill that made you go fast, which was hard to start in the dark because the hill was steep and no one would ride that hill. If it was a more popular path, then it would have been easier to ride the hill because then there would be more people around who could help you if you got hurt. There is also no lighting there, so if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going unless you put a light on your bike or helmet; then you can ride easier down the hill at night. That lack of light is one of the key features of the setting that affects the cyclist going down a hill where no one is there to offer assistance if it is needed.
435	6413	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode, demanding constant vigilance. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else he could have been seriously injured by an unexpected hazard. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to navigate down steep hills and around sharp, windy turns, which tests his skill and control over the bicycle. In conclusion, the features of the setting have a huge affect on the cyclist, directly influencing both his safety and his ability to progress on his journey.
436	6414	3	3	Setting can affect a cyclist in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehydrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisonous snakes were ever-present. The cyclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling off his bike, dehydration, and a bite from a snake. Say you are in the mountains of a remote region. There are many problems that face you there, including steep climbs and sudden weather changes. In conclusion, the environment presents constant challenges that can turn a simple ride into a struggle for survival.
437	6415	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him with their intense heat and arid air. Also, “Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.” For example, flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills which demanded more effort. Then after overcoming that, “A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55.” This warning signaled a new difficulty with cracked and uneven pavement. Last the author says, “Sometimes life can feel so cruel,” reflecting the cumulative strain of the journey. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist, from the landscape to the official warnings on the road.
438	6416	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of their water because it was hot and they would get extremely thirsty from all of that pedaling under the scorching sun. The relentless heat accelerated their need for hydration, quickly depleting their vital water supply. This created a dangerous situation where the cyclist's physical resources were being drained by the environment itself. In conclusion, the setting's high temperature directly influenced the cyclist's water consumption, posing a significant risk to their well-being.
439	6417	3	3	In the essay entitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes and so does the mood of the essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the beginning of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the beginning of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting ready to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a couple of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows that the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another twenty miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point the cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another thirty miles to go. Thirty miles of rolling hills and hot sun while seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign appears, one for a bait shop, offering a chance for rescue. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie, uses the setting to effect the mood, demonstrating a clear link between the physical environment and the emotional journey.
440	6418	3	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, “Öa blues tune ‘summer time’ rattled around inÖmy deteriorating brain.” The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brain is starting to shut down from the exhausting conditions. It’s also because there is very little water left for him, intensifying his physical struggle. Another problem is that every building and town except the last building is deserted, offering no refuge or supplies. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it’s the author versus nature in a harsh landscape. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, “Öhaven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” The world has greatly changed since their time. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape for traffic that no longer comes. The towns the old people mentioned are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author, leaving him isolated in a forgotten part of the country. In conclusion, the setting’s desolation and outdated information directly contributed to the author's perilous situation.
441	6419	3	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, distinct changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist’s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist began that morning, “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated. The promising shortcut led him onto a long, desolate road through an unforgiving desert landscape. The sun beat down relentlessly, and with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time wisely using his map to guide his way forward.
442	6420	3	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough, bumpy, and dangerous road. The uneven surface jolted his bike, demanding constant attention to maintain control. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and hurt or even kill him, scanning the scrubland for any sudden movement. Since he had no water he was de hydrating, his throat dry and his energy waning. Also the road was not very well taken care of, covered in loose gravel and potholes, so it took more energy to get through it, slowing his progress to a grueling crawl under the oppressive heat.
443	6421	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like he's coming or going on a vacation. The vast, empty horizon and the long, straight road create a sense of isolation. Because of the way he's riding it, it seems he's going real fast, as about to fall, with the bike wobbling precariously on the sandy shoulder. This visual tension between the open road and his unstable control highlights the vulnerability of his journey through the stark landscape.
444	6422	3	3	The cyclist is out in the desert and therefore was tired, his muscles aching from the sustained effort. He was also running out of water, the last drops in his bottle long gone, so he's getting dehydrated. The relentless sun and dry air sapped his strength with every passing mile, turning his ride into a strenuous test of endurance against the harsh, arid environment.
445	6423	3	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the start he had confidence which died once he got into the barren desert but picked up when he found a rest stop. A prime example is how he started, “with strong legs and a smile on my face” to “the growing realization that I could dropping heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June because I’d listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their perch in decades” to “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The overall mood of the story is based off how the author feels, shifting from optimism to despair and finally to relieved gratitude, all dictated by the challenging and then welcoming features of his surroundings.
446	6424	3	3	The features of the setting in this story, “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,” affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area, a landscape characterized by its vast emptiness and relentless sun. It can get very hot there, like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through was so arid, and that he was out of water, put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated, a condition worsened by the extreme heat. The area he was biking through had barely any people, with long stretches of road showing no signs of life. This means there was no water available for him, leaving him with no recourse for relief. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of harsh, isolated setting, the story and the cyclist's peril would have completely changed.
447	6425	3	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist, primarily through the challenging terrain he must navigate. “I maneuvered down the hill,” is a statement that shows him going down the hill, a task requiring focus and control. If the hill wasn't there then it would have been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, as he could have maintained a steady, efficient pace. Also, he would have had more energy, energy that was instead expended on the difficult ascent preceding the descent. If there weren't any hills to get in his way, his entire journey would have been far less physically taxing and much quicker to complete.
448	6426	3	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills, creating a dual challenge for the rider. These factors greatly affected the cyclist, testing his endurance and resolve. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply, which the heat threatened to deplete rapidly. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down,” showing the temperature was rising and intensifying his discomfort. Furthermore, the text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" which introduced a new physical obstacle. The author’s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills, adding a mechanical difficulty to the geographic one. Seems like everything went wrong for this man with the environment against him, but he still made it through determination."
449	6427	3	3	"In the short story “Do not exceed speed limit,” time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of California in June, a combination known for creating severe conditions. The fact that the story took place in June, and especially in a California desert, really is what caused the cyclist’s dehydration, as this is one of the hottest and driest environments. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual, though in a desert the humidity is low but the solar radiation is intense. This intense heat caused the dehydration and prompted the ""growing realization that I,"" the author, was in a serious and potentially dangerous situation far from help."
450	6428	3	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with its difficult geography. With winding roads and hills, peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging for any rider. This was compounded by the rider having little to no knowledge of the way, so the roads were ten times harder to deal with due to the constant uncertainty. And with no landmarks or places in sight, its hard to have confidence and maintain morale because there is nothing visible to keep going for, no sign of progress or destination. This psychological burden, imposed by the featureless landscape, made an already physically demanding journey even more arduous.
451	6429	3	3	Don’t let anything stop you from pursuing your goals, such as going to Yosemite National Park. It takes a certain status that would put one far outside their comfort zone, off side from home. Forty miles into the journey, one comes to a small, dusty town. At a water station, you might get nothing because old men there say “the water tastes like buttery acid.” The path then leads to the hills and to remote asyl towns, a route that can be ridden without anything to drink. Tragically, people sometimes die from heat attacks because they don’t stop to sit and take breaks for necessary water and food, pushing themselves too hard in the unforgiving environment.
452	6430	3	3	Features in the setting of the cyclist’s journey do in fact affect him in many significant ways. The setting in the passage includes features like having no one to be seen for miles, no buildings for shelter, a dirty and bumpy terrain, intensely hot weather, and plenty of wild vegetation. All these environmental features affect the cyclist in profoundly negative ways. For instance, the dry, hot weather directly affects the human body by causing rapid dehydration, a dangerous condition which the cyclist is severely affected by as he struggles through the barren landscape.
453	6431	3	3	The setting in the story affects the cyclist a great deal, shaping his difficult experience. It is June in the harsh California desert, and the relentless sun is beating down on him without any shade for protection. Another serious problem that he faces is that there is a very rough and uneven terrain, full of rocks and ruts that jar his body. All of this together makes him drink up his precious water even faster, depleting his vital supplies. The hostile setting is making him feel very desperate, a mental state which is even worse than his physical fatigue.
454	6432	3	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out and defines their character. Someone can be good looking, smart, or naturally confident. Someone else might possess the powerful trait of never giving up, always striving to do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is one such man with a remarkably strong will. He possesses a deep, burning desire to be alive. He saw too many difficulties in his way to get to the place he wanted to be. He once listened to some old guys and consequently lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down mercilessly. He was completely out of water but he continued riding, determined to reach his goal, even as he was losing his physical strength. The weather was intensely hot. The water he remembered tasted like acid battery. Yet, he believed in himself that he could stay alive. He got psychologically stronger by believing in himself even though he was losing physical strength. Every new place that he passed by was a new experience for life. They were like levels in a challenging game that he eventually came through successfully. He never gave up. He did everything he could possibly do to avoid losing his mind amidst the hardship. He didn’t want to lose the critical battle in his own mind, and his perseverance ultimately defined his journey.
455	6433	3	3	The features of the setting consistently made the cyclist more tired and thirsty throughout his ordeal. The rolling hills where he had to pedal strenuously up and coast down and the vast desert with no water in sight, just endless dry land, drained his energy. Everything in the setting was deliberately increasing the conflict in his story. The sight of the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, for instance, is a cruel reminder that drinks are right there but are now gone, a tantalizing mirage of the past. If the setting would have been Yosemite with its cool pines and fresh rivers he would’ve felt completely different and refreshed. The fact that there were no people in sight lacked any sense of security and hope for water, and also no buildings for respite. The tumble weeds rolling across the landscape gave you no hope of getting anywhere meaningful, and the presence of snakes and vultures seemed to promise they would just eat you after you died from exposure. Everything in the story was the absolute opposite of what he wanted and needed for survival, until he finally got to his last hope: the distant bait shop.
456	6434	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a strain on the cyclist, causing him to have to drink lots of water and struggle against the oppressive, dry air. Unfortonatly the “towns” were very far apart and many not having good water, making dehydration a constant and serious problem. The isolation is clear when he observes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” None of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map that accounted for such harsh, remote conditions. Ultimately, the unforgiving desert environment was the primary antagonist of his journey.
457	6435	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist, creating a direct physical challenge. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said “I got down on my hands working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength,” a statement that shows his desperation due to the critical lack of water. His entire physical effort was focused on this single, unreliable source of relief, highlighting how the arid setting dictated his actions and consumed his energy. This moment of struggle encapsulates the constant battle he faced against his environment, where a simple necessity like water became a monumental task.
458	6436	3	3	The features of the setting been a major affect of this cyclist in the story, shaping every aspect of his difficult journey. On a normal road, the ground is smooth but this path is a lot like a rough and winding trail. The cyclist also comes across bumps and non-paved roads full of gravel and dust that make it hard to maneuver through and maintain balance. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns for rest and he is in a blazing heat with little water, which compounds the physical toll. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story by creating a series of interconnected obstacles that tested the cyclist's endurance and resolve to the limit.
459	6437	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need a lot of water to survive the scorching sun. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was “some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,"" making it undrinkable and useless. Then the terrain changes when he says “Flat road was replaced” by steep, challenging inclines that demanded even more exertion. This combination of extreme heat, scarce resources, and difficult topography created a multifaceted challenge that directly impacted his physical state and his chances of success on the journey."
460	6438	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the story was talking about the exceed posted speed limit and the nature of the advice he received. It discusses how the speed limit warning or where it says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” They are trying to say is that, if you do what they say you are going to be misled, as peoples' outdated travel advice will not work in the current landscape, so you must make the right choice and do the right thing by relying on accurate, modern information. This illustrates that the social setting, comprised of locals with outdated knowledge, is just as important a feature as the physical one, as it can lead a traveler astray before the journey even properly begins.
461	6439	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dictating that he or she should behave, act, or talk in accordance with the surroundings. It means that wherever they are and whatever the environment looks like, they need to fit themselves into it. They also need to align their mood and actions according to the specific location they are in. The cyclist in the story is feeling comfortable and does not require any change in the setting or location. For conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by requiring that he needs to make improvements and personal changes to adapt to wherever he or she is located, ensuring a harmonious existence within that space.
462	6440	3	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy, filled with anticipation for the journey ahead. By the time he got half way there he was losing hope, as the initial excitement had faded. It was very hot and he was simply alone, with no one to share the burden of the difficult trek. By the end, he was profoundly relieved because not only did he find a source of water to quench his thirst, he also discovered an easier, more manageable way to get to his destination of Yosemite. The first old group of men he encountered didn't help him, offering no assistance, but the second man did provide the crucial aid he needed to continue.
463	6441	3	3	"In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, and it says this because the cyclist enables us to understand what is going on around him and how he feels about it. It says, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” The author goes on to say that the desolate scene troubled him. Actually, that description made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with a ghost town. The unpaved and rough roads were a concern where the speed limit was posted at 55 mph, but since he barely had any water he was only going 12 mph. This tells me he’s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because the entire desert seemed to highlight how the author is slowly losing hope on the travels further and further. I think it’s the same with many people that as soon as trouble comes, or when it looks like trouble is approaching, they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder than it truly is."
464	6442	3	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry and devoid of moisture. The rider would be getting real thirsty under the relentless sun. He is all by himself on this journey, and that solitary state would make any man feel a sense of isolated strength, because if you have an accident then nobody would be there to help you out. He's going up and down steep hills on his bicycle, so he would have to be careful with his balance and speed to avoid a fall. This constant vigilance is a direct result of the challenging terrain he must navigate.
465	6443	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, both physically and mentally. For instance, if you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn’t sweat as much and wouldn’t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, leading to distress. The quote, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist's experience and well-being. Also, the terrain can significantly affect a biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain it is going to put much less wear and tear on the cyclist's body, therefore making the flat terrain much easier to manage. All of those reasons explain comprehensively that the settings affect the cyclist in many important ways.
466	6444	3	3	The setting plays an important part in the author's mood, reflecting his internal state throughout the journey. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s “town” was now abandoned, noting that “(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh at the situation. When “a tar like substance oozed out of the water pump at the next stop,” the author became a little unsettled, as he was running low on water. But he was still optimistic, hoping for a better outcome ahead. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, however, the author let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” The author was depressed, dehydrated and had all but given up, feeling the full weight of his predicament. However he kept going, pushing through the difficult terrain, and eventually made it to some water, a testament to his enduring perseverance.
467	6445	3	3	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the setting must definitely affects the cyclist, mirroring his struggle and isolation. When the cyclist comes to the first abandoned “town,” he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid, noting “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” This makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has found water, but it is just undrinkable, deepening his frustration. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist is on his last legs he must work even harder to get water, as “a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist must persevere against the challenging landscape. Also, the quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” evokes a feeling of desolation and of being completely alone, which is precisely what the cyclist is experiencing at this point in his arduous journey. The setting of this story directly correlates with how the cyclist is feeling, charting his physical and emotional decline.
468	6446	3	3	It was a hot day in June for riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park, embarking on a journey that would test his limits. The old men had told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years, offering directions that were perhaps outdated. When the cyclist started his day off, he was ready to go, filled with initial enthusiasm. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regularly, but as he found out, he was in the middle of the desert with no water around, a harsh and unexpected reality. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water, focusing instead on the road ahead. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water, a classic trick to stave off thirst. The man was very smart in this difficult situation and knew what to do to survive. This experience, while grueling, has ultimately made him stronger and more resilient.
469	6447	3	3	Flat roads, hills, and buildings are all settings that affected the cyclist profoundly, each presenting a different mental challenge. While the hills were flat, the cyclist was determined; he felt he could make it and wasn’t going to give up on himself, spurred by the easier terrain. When the hills got bigger and harder to pedal up, he began to get exhausted and tired, his energy sapped by the increasing difficulty. Lastly, the buildings were what made him want to give up, as they symbolized the comfort and sustenance he lacked. When he sees the building of the Welch’s grape juice factory and the young boy drinking, he “hung his head” in despair and envy. He was getting more tired as he went along, and the land itself was making him feel as if he didn’t want to keep moving along, each feature of the setting chipping away at his resolve.
470	6448	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly, creating a dire situation that tested his limits. He had no water and he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” a time of extreme heat. The deserts and the lack of water could have been a life-or-death situation for him, making him stressed and unbearably thirsty. Couple that with him biking, a physically demanding activity, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in a very dangerous environment! When he was between the “ghost town” and the bait shop, he observes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This profound isolation would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out, with no one around to offer help. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly, but especially one without water like the cyclist in the story, whose ordeal highlights the powerful influence of environment on human endurance.
471	6449	3	3	I think it means to be all you can be, to strive for your full potential in every endeavor you undertake. It is about pushing your own limits and discovering the extent of your own capabilities, without comparing yourself to others. Ultimately, it is a personal journey of growth and self-realization, where the goal is to become the very best version of yourself that you can possibly be.
472	6450	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it, the intense sun draining his energy with every turn of the pedals. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1, a desperate attempt to generate saliva in his parched mouth. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit, a warning that matched the growing difficulty of his journey. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3, his physical condition severely impacted by the harsh environment surrounding him.
473	6451	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water, his hope for relief shattered by the desolate landscape. This unexpected setback deepened his physical crisis, forcing him to continue his journey under the punishing sun without any source of replenishment, pushing him closer to his physical limits.
474	6452	3	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you donít have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time, a clear sign of his extreme desperation. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body, a direct and dangerous consequence of the oppressive environmental conditions he was forced to endure.
475	6453	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out, as the heat made his only resource almost undrinkable. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. The challenging topography combined with the extreme heat created a doubly difficult situation for the cyclist, demonstrating how the setting's features worked together to impede his progress. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
476	6454	3	3	The cyclist in the story is profoundly affected by the fatal use of setting in the story. The hills affected him because they are physically harder to get over, demanding greater exertion and draining his already limited energy. This environmental challenge compounds his difficulties, making his journey not just a physical trial but a test of his will to continue against the imposing landscape.
477	6455	3	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town."" This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die with no one around to help. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water, exacerbating his thirst and fatigue. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on up the inclines. Each feature of the setting thus presents a distinct challenge that tests his endurance."
478	6456	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a lot of ways; one way is that if you don't know where you are going you could get hurt or become lost. Also, if the road conditions are very bad, such as being rough or unpaved, it can make the journey more hazardous and physically taxing. The cyclist's progress and safety are directly influenced by these environmental factors. That is how the setting affected the cyclist, by presenting real physical dangers that he had to navigate carefully.
479	6457	3	3	In this essay, features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite and makes it worse. First, for example, the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because the intense heat makes it harder on the cyclist, sapping his strength. Also, being in the deserts there wasn't any water supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dehydrated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the terrain changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn't have water he couldn't function as well as if he was hydrated. The combination of these harsh setting elements created a severe challenge for his journey.
480	6458	3	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere, a desolate and unfamiliar place. By her being out there, her cycle was being affected as she faced isolation and uncertainty. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn't, as the challenging environment impeded her progress. She kept moving on down the road despite the setbacks. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it badly, demonstrating her determination against the adversities presented by the setting. Her resolve was ultimately shaped by the difficult circumstances she endured.
481	6459	3	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride through the desert during the intense heat of June and with a critically low supply of water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates a lot and is directly threatened with heatstroke, a danger that loomed over him constantly. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him, a moment that required immense focus despite his weakened state. Personally I don’t know what he was doing riding through the desert by himself, a decision that seemed fraught with peril, and that’s his problem, one born from a questionable choice that defined his arduous journey.
482	6460	3	3	"In the story, the setting in many ways affects the cyclist. Three of those things are the heat, the lack of water, and the misleading ghost town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired, sapping his energy with its relentless intensity. For example the text states, ""I could die from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June,"" this shows that it was extremely hot and the conditions were deceptively dangerous. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty, which impacted his physical capabilities. For example it states in the text, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water, a condition that made even simple maneuvers difficult. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and finds it empty, a crushing disappointment. The text states, ""on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This shows that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was supposed to be, leaving him without the respite he desperately needed. These things all show how the setting affected the cyclist throughout his challenging ordeal."
483	6461	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of significant ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the desert, an environment known for its harsh and unforgiving nature. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated, as the dry air and scorching sun pulled moisture from his body relentlessly. The second way was that there were rough roads and hilly spots along his path, which presented constant physical obstacles. This made him more tired faster, draining his stamina with every difficult mile. In conclusion, the setting did not help him not one little bit, instead posing a series of challenges that tested his limits at every turn.
484	6462	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, primarily through the consequences of his poor planning. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man's advise because all the necessary information was on the map, which would have revealed the true nature of the route. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn’t look at his map, leading him into a treacherous and isolated landscape. If the cyclist was in a car maybe he would have had better luck because he would be going faster than the bicycle and could have traversed the dangerous area more quickly and with better protection from the elements. His choice of transportation and route ultimately defined the perilous nature of his experience.
485	6463	3	3	Many things on the cyclist's journey affected him profoundly. It was in the middle of summer in California, a time when the weather is at its most extreme. The heat is unbelievable and ridiculously hot, creating an oppressive atmosphere. “I could drop from heatstroke,” he thought, and he was so badly overheated and dehydrated that he could have died any minute, his body pushed to its absolute limit. He could have also been killed by a giant snake, a sudden and terrifying danger. “look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement.” It could have easily killed him, if he wasn’t careful, presenting a lethal obstacle in his path. But with his determination and spite he pulled through and made it to a fresh supply of water, a hard-won victory. If he would have given up his life would have been over, but his perseverance in the face of these extreme setting features allowed him to survive.
486	6464	3	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road, the old men told him in all good faith that he should go that way. But the old man had not seen the land in a really long time. The man did not know that the land had changed significantly since he last traveled it. So when the cyclist went back to ride, the roads were broken and everything ended in desolate, unfamiliar terrain, leaving the cyclist not knowing what to do next in his confusion.
487	6465	3	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, and these manifest in ways both mentally and physically. The ways mentally include that the cyclists can lose their determination and pride if they cannot fight the arduous journey of cycling through such a demanding landscape. The ways physically are that the setting is intensely hot and the terrain is rough, and consequently the cyclist would have a critical lack of water and food supplies. Those were the primary ways how a cyclist would be affected by the harsh features of the setting, impacting his entire being both mentally and physically.
488	6466	3	3	"The cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead"" was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad conditions if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it is usually extremely hot, and I know in California it is usually always hot. The cyclist is on a bike, which means he has to pedal everywhere he goes. This is not only going to use up all his energy but also make him dangerously hot. And when you are this hot you need to keep hydrated. But you are lost, so if you use all your water before you find safety then you are in major trouble. Also, in California there are hills, and mountains and stuff, and peddling up a steep mountain is not an easy trick for anyone, especially someone who is already exhausted."
489	6467	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water, all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight, which deepened his sense of isolation. In the story it says “the building abandoned years earlier,” indicating a complete lack of resources or help. If I was him I would have turned around and went back the way I came, so I would take the chance of not dying out in the middle of an abandoned area where no aid could be found.
490	6468	3	3	The setting is the main factor regarding the effects on the cyclist. The cyclist’s main problem is that he is low on water and severely dehydrated, as noted by the line, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author would not have been so dehydrated if it were not for the setting being so relentlessly hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related, like the encounter with the snake and the rough road itself. If the journey would have taken place in a more mild and forgiving area, there would not have been any significant conflicts for him to overcome.
491	6469	3	3	In the story the cyclist is affected by setting because in the early paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying unsuccessfully to get water out of it, which highlights his growing desperation. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he realizes that the old men didn’t know what they were talking about and had given him false hope. Also at the end he is relieved when he finds Gary and the organization because there is water there, finally quenching his thirst and ending his arduous struggle. This sequence of events clearly demonstrates how the physical environment directly shaped his emotional journey.
492	6470	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” a description that emphasizes his utter isolation. When he realizes his solitude at a moment when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs, feeling the weight of his predicament. As a result of the seclusion of the setting, having only seen “One ramshackle shed in many miles,” the cyclist almost loses hope, believing rescue is unlikely. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers” of his destination, a mental image that fuels his determination to continue. That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and his initial despair is ultimately turned to hope.
493	6471	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it’s very hot outside and he is starting to lose energy from the relentless heat. The setting affects how fast he rides, dictating when he stops to rest or when he drinks or eats to replenish his strength. All of these actions depend on the type of weather he is riding in, which on this day is particularly harsh. Like in the story, it was so hot out that when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, a reaction that underscores the extreme conditions. This constant battle with the environment ultimately dictates the rhythm and difficulty of his journey.
494	6472	3	3	In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather, land, and surrounding objects really determined the cyclist's mood and physical ability throughout his ride. One example would be the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident, energized, and ready to take on the challenge. Another example would be the quote, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greet me.” There, the cyclist feels troubled and a little curious as to what lay ahead; this water wasn't the best and he was worried about its quality. The last example was, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” There, the cyclist tries to stay focused through these distractions; it is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well, testing his resolve. As his route ends he comes across many more aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability, each leaving its mark. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw, consistently affected his choices and his ability to persevere.
495	6473	3	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cyclist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited amount of water, a situation fraught with peril. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water, pushing his body to its absolute limits. The harsh, unrelenting landscape becomes a direct antagonist to his journey. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, creating a physical challenge that nearly overcomes him.
496	6474	3	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways, primarily through isolation and scarcity. The description, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me,” paints a picture of profound desolation. The cyclist was expecting a small, functioning town with people and a reliable water supply. However, he instead found a deserted ghost town where the only available pump was rusty and yielded no water. This discovery made the cyclist feel profoundly depressed, as he was running critically low on water and faced the real danger of dehydration under the relentless sun. Further compounding his struggle was the highway itself, where “The speed limit was posted high. I was doing a water-depleting crawl. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The cyclist is painfully aware of cars passing him at high speed while he can only manage a slow, exhausting pace. This contrast probably makes him feel as if he is getting nowhere, amplifying his frustration and providing a strong reason to simply give up. Yet, despite the disheartening environment and the feeling of being outpaced by the world, a spark of determination ignites within him, compelling him to continue and finish his arduous journey against the odds.
497	6475	3	3	The cyclist's situation was defined by severe hardship and vulnerability. He had very little water remaining in his bottles, a dire circumstance exacerbated by the intense, unrelenting heat. He still had a long way to go to reach his destination, and the journey was made even more difficult by the condition of the road. The surface was very bumpy and cracked, forcing him to maintain a cautious speed; going too fast risked a busted tire or a fall. To make matters worse, there were no cars in sight along the desolate stretch. This profound isolation meant that if he did break down, he would be stranded for a long time with no hope of immediate assistance, a sobering thought that underscored his complete reliance on his own dwindling resources and fortitude.
498	6476	3	3	The setting profoundly affects the cyclist in many ways, and following the old-timers' advice ultimately proves to have been unwise. In the essay, he was headed to Yosemite National Park, equipped with a map and his own confidence as an experienced cyclist who knew his way around. However, he encountered a couple of men who suggested a shortcut. He trusted them, a decision he soon regretted, and set off on the recommended path. The setting was immediately rough; he was riding through a California desert, which was oppressively hot, and he was desperately looking for water. The only water he found tasted like live battery acid, rendering it completely useless. The landscape shifted from flat, barren land to rolling hills, and the next town was still many miles away. This cyclist was pushing himself to the limit. While riding through these lands, there was nothing in sight—no buildings or passing cars—it was like a dead road. Those old men had sent him through a difficult and desolate area, and once he finally made it to the next town, he understood the full weight of having endured such severe conditions based on a misplaced trust.
499	6477	3	3	On the cyclist's way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their directions are not reliable. The deserted place affected him deeply because there was nowhere for him to stop for food or to refill his water bottle. The text notes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” emphasizing his complete isolation. He encountered rusted water pumps, but they only offered hot, undrinkable water, providing nothing to cool him down or quench his powerful thirst. His harsh surroundings, marked by heat and emptiness, directly led him to a dangerous state of dehydration, turning his journey into a desperate struggle for the most basic necessity. This experience highlights how the physical environment became his greatest adversary on the road.
500	6478	3	3	The features of the setting, including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water, all create significant obstacles for the cyclist. Due to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling, he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a proper rest. Also, there were no other travelers on the road, so he could not ask for assistance from anyone. Another major obstacle during his trip were the hills, which required more energy to pedal up, causing him to tire easily and slowing his progress considerably. There was also the extreme heat, which caused him to sweat profusely and become even more thirsty, accelerating the depletion of his water supply. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” indicating his growing desperation. He is becoming dangerously thirsty, and if he doesn’t find water soon, he will dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there might be water but is not able to find one. All of these interconnected obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and nearly lose hope, but he perseveres, continues his travel, and eventually finds a place to rest, demonstrating resilience in the face of a compounding environmental challenge.
501	6479	3	3	I really thought the story didn’t make sense; the narrative was confusing and the setting was crazy, lacking any coherent logic. I really wasn’t feeling it at all, as the characters' actions seemed arbitrary and the plot was disjointed. I don’t think it was even a good story, failing to deliver a compelling or engaging experience from start to finish. Ultimately, the entire concept felt poorly conceived and executed.
502	6480	3	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways, directly influencing the difficulty and experience of the ride. If you have a bumpy ride on a rough road surface, then the cyclist will have a harder time maintaining speed and control. Also, if it is really hilly with steep inclines, then it is harder on the legs and will take longer to complete the journey too. As the text states, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” which means it will take him longer to reach his destination, requiring more energy and effort. Furthermore, animals in the setting can also be effective obstacles. For instance, “and a ridiculously, large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” Animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist, causing sudden stops. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the road right in front of you, it could startle you and you could clash, potentially leading to a fall. On the other hand, environmental features can offer benefits. Sometimes trees make it cooler by providing shade because you don’t have the sun beating directly down on your back, offering relief from the heat. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a refreshing drink to rehydrate. In conclusion, the setting in which a cyclist is riding can significantly help or hurt the cyclist, shaping the entire journey.
503	6481	3	3	It affected him by severely dehydrating him and wearing him down both physically and mentally to the point where he was about to give up on his arduous journey. But he never gave up, pushing through the exhaustion and hardship with sheer determination. As the end, a profound sense of satisfaction and accomplishment came out of it all, making the struggle worthwhile and proving his resilience.
504	6482	3	3	The trees were present in the landscape, and their autumnal foliage was making the colors a brilliant red, while the distant volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered the mountainous regions. This entire scene was in the landscape that, millions of years ago, underwent a dramatic transformation where the ancient swampland eventually became the arid desert we see today, marking a significant geological history.
505	6483	3	3	There were a few key features in the setting that profoundly affected the cyclist during his journey. One very important feature is that the cyclist was riding through the desert, a harsh and unforgiving environment. This is demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” Not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest and most challenging months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June according to the statement “I was travelling in June.” Being there at that time made dehydration a much bigger risk due to the extreme heat. It was also very hot there, with temperatures soaring. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was it extremely hot, but the available water was dirty and overheated. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid,” making it virtually undrinkable. This was particularly bad for the cyclist who was running dangerously low on his own water supply because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little clean water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was truly in a bad situation, facing multiple environmental challenges. These conditions had all ganged-up against him in his trip, creating a cumulative effect of hardship. These primary antagonistic features are the desert itself, the punishingly high temperatures, and the blackish, foul-tasting water which was completely unpalatable. The fact that he was low on his own water made it harder to fight these features, as he could not properly rehydrate to battle the desert heat and had no need to pump the bad water. Again, the defining features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert landscape, the extreme high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink, culminating in a severe test of his endurance.
506	6484	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park, envisioning the cool, refreshing lakes and streams. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist, wearing down his initial enthusiasm. The sun beat down on the cyclist's back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the relentless heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink, rationing his dwindling supply. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways, a promise that spurred him onward. The town, however, was the traditional definition of a ghost town, with boarded-up windows and dusty, silent streets. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map, which provided a renewed, if cautious, sense of direction for his arduous journey.
507	6485	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey, testing his physical limits. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first ‘Town’…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park, relying on their local knowledge. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling, the air thick and heavy. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather, each ascent draining his energy further. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish, a simple luxury denied to him. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water, conserving his precious resources. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2, who also faced a harsh and unforgiving environment. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination, battling both nature and his own fatigue. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way, creating significant obstacles that challenge his endurance and resolve.
508	6486	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was profoundly affected by the setting, which presented a series of physical challenges. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills, demanding greater effort and stamina. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated, a frightening encounter that heightened his sense of vulnerability. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, the arid landscape amplifying his thirst, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through, his goal providing the necessary motivation to persevere against the harsh environmental conditions.
509	6487	3	3	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist that paint a vivid picture of his struggle. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile, leaving the infrastructure to decay. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June, a time of peak heat, I am able to understand how thirsty he is and the intensity of his physical ordeal. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted, his muscles aching with every push on the pedals. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted, a moment of profound relief and accomplishment after his long and difficult trek through the unforgiving landscape.
510	6488	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn’t have much water, a combination that created a serious risk. In the text it says “I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.” The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month, ensuring he would face extreme temperatures. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn’t able to drink much because he had limited water, forcing him to endure the mounting discomfort and focus on the long road ahead, a testament to the challenging influence of his environment on the journey.
511	6489	3	3	The setting profoundly affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. The relentless sun beat down, which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water rapidly. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, his energy sapped by the oppressive heat. Since it is the vast, empty desert, there isnít any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, amplifying his isolation, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop, a welcome sight in the barren landscape, and he has a drink there so he is okay, his ordeal finally over.
512	6490	3	3	In the story *Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit* the setting greatly affects the cyclist throughout his challenging journey. With long rides stretching for miles, hilly roads that tested his endurance, and very little water available, the cyclist was pretty good at managing his composure. I mean he could have been very angry and frustrated by the difficult conditions, but he kept his cool and stayed calm, demonstrating a resilient spirit in the face of adversity. His ability to remain collected was key to his progress on the demanding route.
513	6491	3	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welchís Grape Juice factory- all are distinct parts of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist. ìThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,î describes the cyclist, ìbut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î The desolate town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing with every abandoned building. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the ìshortcut,î feeling misled by the empty promise. ìNot two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,î reveals the cyclist as the road grew more arduous. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the rough terrain is making it worse; it mirrors the deserted town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. Then the cyclist exclaims, ì By the looks of it- had been a Welchís Grape Juice Factory.î Upon seeing this landmark, the cyclist gets very excited and gets a great feeling of hope, a stark contrast to his earlier despair. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope, ultimately shaping his emotional journey.
514	6492	3	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts during the warm summer months, a time of intense heat. The heat and the uninhabited, lonely canal path were the biggest struggle for the cyclist, offering no respite. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water during his trip, relying on this assumption, but he was mistaken as the landscape was barren. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the scorching heat, which accelerated his thirst. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut that seemed to lead nowhere. Ultimately, the setting affected the cyclistís mood in a negative way, fostering frustration and regret on his difficult journey.
515	6493	3	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that physically affected the cyclist during his ride. It stated, ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî (Kurmaskie @NUM1), introducing a new challenge. The cyclist was pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along, straining his muscles. Also it stated,î At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeî (Kurmaskie @NUM2), creating obstacles. This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down, interrupting his rhythm. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy, proving the environment was a formidable opponent in the race.
516	6494	3	3	Many things can affect a cyclist and how they ride, and in this essay, many things affected him, such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was that there were no stores or even people for many miles, creating a profound sense of isolation. Another and most important thing was the critical lack of water around him, which became a constant source of worry. The vast, empty landscape offered no respite from the harsh conditions. So many things can effect a cyclist while they are riding, including their immediate surroundings and the challenges presented by the environment, which ultimately shape their entire journey and experience on the road.
517	6495	3	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay “A Sea Worry,” because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job and in the second picture a boy is surfing in the ocean. The author says, “my son body-surfs. He says it’s his ‘job’.” That quote was explaining that he’s a body-surfer and it’s his primary occupation, his chosen way of life. The image visually reinforces this central theme of a deep, personal connection to the sea. This direct parallel between the textual description and the visual content is the primary reason I chose the second photograph to represent the essay's core idea.
518	6496	3	3	The condition the cyclist is in affects a lot of how they ride, particularly in challenging environments. One example of this is, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” Due to this fact, the cyclist had went into a “dehydrated state” because of not having much water available on the long, barren route. When you are travelling in hot weather areas without much water, your body will become dehydrated from excessive sweating, leading to fatigue and diminished physical capacity. The physical state of the rider is therefore directly influenced by the external conditions. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists differently, highlighting how a rider's well-being is tied to the environment.
519	6497	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” First, the scorching heat of the desert in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of severe dehydration. In the text it states, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This shows the dangerous effect the prolonged exposure to intense heat had on the cyclist, turning a beautiful day into a potential hazard. Also, the difficult terrain posed a significant threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says “I toiled on.” This shows the increase in effort and physical strain the rugged terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure, compounding the challenges he faced from the climate alone.
520	6498	3	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hot affected him because it made him more thirsty and drained his energy quickly. Then, him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn’t get any water, as there were no services for miles around. Furthermore, the steep hills made him tired and weak, demanding great physical exertion to overcome. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which collectively made him feel powerless and desperately thirsty, demonstrating the overwhelming power of the environment.
521	6499	3	3	The features that affect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesn't have any water. That affects his journey because he is dehydrated, so he needs to find water fast, making his progress toward Yosemite slower as he is forced to search for a source. The relentless sun and the barren landscape create a significant obstacle, directly impacting his speed and physical condition. This is a feature that profoundly affects the cyclist and his ability to complete his journey efficiently. Ultimately, the lack of water becomes the central challenge dictating the pace and difficulty of his travel.
522	6500	3	3	In the story, the setting has a large effect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people, he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or people. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated. He got really tired and almost gave up because of the oppressive heat and the complete lack of water. The isolation of the environment meant there was no one to assist him, leaving him entirely on his own. All this was caused by the harsh and unforgiving setting he was in, which tested his physical and mental limits to the extreme.
523	6501	3	3	The setting of the place was a “ghost town” as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June, so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating quickly under the intense sun. There was no one around, so he couldn’t ask for help or directions from anyone. It was like an old, abandoned town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of the new world, as they ultimately told him the wrong directions, leading him further astray. The desolate and outdated nature of the location directly contributed to his predicament, leaving him lost and without resources. This shows how the specific qualities of the setting created a series of obstacles for the cyclist.
524	6502	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first, it helped him. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers” This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun and provided a pleasant environment. Later on, the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated as the terrain was getting rougher and more barren. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake, adding a element of danger to his isolation. All these features were working against him, creating a formidable challenge, until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map, providing the crucial relief he needed from the hostile environment.
525	6503	3	3	In the story *Rough Road Ahead* by Joe Kurmaskie, it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park and the problems he faced. For example, the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to confront throughout his journey. In the story, it said “Drop from heatstroke,” which shows the setting affected him in a negative and dangerous way, threatening his health. In the story, the intense heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character, shaping his experience and presenting a constant physical threat. This demonstrates how the environmental conditions were a central antagonist in his narrative.
526	6504	3	3	The features of the setting affected the author’s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says “over one long, crippling hill.” This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills, which is physically draining. But if the road wasn’t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult and tiring. This would also make it as if the old guys gave good directions, suggesting an easy path. But the whole point of the setting's description is to emphasize the struggle and the misleading nature of the advice he received.
527	6505	3	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down from the sun's heat. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns—none of which looked promising—which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further into the journey, he found one last town, and a rundown welcher’s factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice, as the place was clearly abandoned. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner for the relief. It made him realize to never again trust the old men and their unreliable guidance.
528	6506	3	3	The setting affects a lot in a cyclist. For example, if you are in a city you feel rushed, tired, and overwhelmed by the traffic and noise. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stressed by the calm and shade. A setting sets the mood and also the attitude in the story, influencing how the character feels and acts throughout their journey. The environment directly shapes the emotional experience and the challenges faced by the individual.
529	6507	3	3	The features of the setting affect the author’s disposition as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of paragraph five the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water in the arid heat. This is similar to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food; our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road, demanding greater physical effort. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay’s narrative of challenge.
530	6508	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “things began well enough.” However, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, though; in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the toll the setting brings upon him, demonstrating his determination to push through the adversity.
531	6509	3	3	"The cyclist is affected by the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead"" because the road itself is a place, and its condition directly impacts the traveler. If the road is rough or unknown, it presents a direct challenge to the cyclist. For instance, if the path includes a hill, then the cyclist would inevitably have to climb it. In the text, the phrase ""over a long crippling hill"" is used, and the description of the hill as ""crippling"" strongly emphasizes how the specific feature of the setting, a steep incline, physically and mentally strains the rider. This demonstrates the powerful influence of the environment on the journey's difficulty."
532	6510	3	3	The various features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist, primarily through the absence of water, the presence of hills, and the expansive deserts. When the cyclist saw water, his desire to jump in was overwhelming, as his mind was completely fixated on the water that they lacked, which he compared to something as undesirable as battery acid. The hills then further impeded his progress, actively slowing him down and delaying his reach to the potential water source. The desert environment, with its arid heat, only served to intensify his thirst and his need for water even more. These are the key features of the settings that significantly affected the cyclist and his arduous journey.
533	6511	3	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist during his journey. One significant factor was the extreme heat of the June sun in California. The speaker explicitly stated that he felt he could have died from heatstroke, highlighting the danger. The rough road was also a major problem for the cyclist, creating additional physical hardship. The constant bumps, the exhausting hills, and even the presence of wildlife all affected the cyclist's progress. However, the thing that most affected him was the severe lack of water. It was such a pressing problem that he resorted to sucking on stones just to take his mind off his powerful thirst. As you can see, these environmental problems in the story collectively affected the speaker's challenging journey to Yosemite National Park.
534	6512	3	3	The features of the setting directly affect the cyclist throughout his ordeal. He is riding through a desert where there is little to no rain. This arid condition means that he cannot collect any rainwater to drink if he runs out of his own supply. Also, deserts are notoriously hot, and the intense heat will speed up his dehydration process, meaning he will need even more water to survive. The consequence is severe; if he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty, offering no respite. All these features of the setting affect him profoundly. Since he cannot find water, he has to carefully conserve what little he has. The heat is overwhelming and feels as though it is killing him. It does not help that the only structure he finds is abandoned, reinforcing his isolation. During this time, with death in the air, the barren desert with nothing growing and no water, the cyclist is consumed with thoughts of his own death. As long as he thinks about his death, the feeling of doom only intensifies. However, as soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and his thirst, he sees a bait shop which ultimately saves his life. He shifted his thoughts to surviving, and immediately found a shop where he could finally drink.
535	6513	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride, creating a series of life-threatening challenges. The quote, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” clearly illustrates this impact. This statement shows that because of the relentless heat, the rough terrain, and the unexpected length of his so-called “shortcut,” his water supply is nearly gone. That is the critical moment when he realizes he could actually die from heatstroke, a dire situation he attributes to having listened to the advice of a bunch of old men. This highlights how the environmental conditions directly led to a crisis of survival.
536	6514	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water, which is a critical resource in such an arid environment. Without water he tired very easily, as dehydration quickly saps one's energy. On top of that he had to pedal a bicycle across the vast, sandy terrain, which required significant physical exertion. So he was thirsty and tired, a direct result of prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist, creating a challenging and draining experience.
537	6515	3	3	Setting affects the cyclist in several significant ways. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition, which can vary greatly. If the road condition is bad, with potholes or loose gravel, then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed to maintain control and avoid accidents. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night, as visibility is a major factor for safety. If it is night, they must be especially careful due to cars not being able to see them clearly in the darkness. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather, which adds another layer of difficulty. This is dangerous to a cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water and proper sun protection, highlighting how the environment dictates the journey's demands.
538	6516	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough), hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that short trip, and wasnít prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the ìhigh deserts of colifornia in Juneî I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that intense heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a ìridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond backî That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to ìease postî it because, of his lack of water and resulting fatigue. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was ìreplaced by short, rolling hillsî which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills, further depleting his reserves. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination, but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson about preparation and perseverance?"
539	6517	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty and accelerates his need for hydration. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies, leaving him without access to water or food. Also the bad road slowed him down, forcing him to navigate carefully. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike with jolts and vibrations; the roads also would make him work harder, demanding more energy with each rotation of the pedals. Ultimately, the harsh environment presented a series of interconnected obstacles that significantly impeded his progress.
540	6518	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how ìI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated stateî. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didnít know well of and he was dehydrated, which impaired his coordination and physical control. The unfamiliar and demanding terrain directly contributed to his physical distress. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist by creating conditions that challenged his body and his ability to navigate safely.
541	6519	3	3	First, the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through, offering a smooth start to his arduous journey; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go, finding only a small, nearly dry stream. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road, a choice that added to his uncertainty. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy, fearing the directions might be wrong. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road, hoping for the best. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills, which began to sap his energy. These hills reduced his stamina greatly, forcing him to push harder with each pedal. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desert road, which jolted his bike and his resolve. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him, swerving just in time. Finally the biker faced his last long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water, a welcome sight that promised relief.
542	6520	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does, amplifying his sense of isolation and hardship. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground, which compounds his misery. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing, as it is either inaccessible or not what he imagined. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills, which further tests his endurance. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph, highlighting his slow, painful progress. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst, a cruel reminder of what he lacks. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he’d be better off using his map, a final blow to his misguided efforts.
543	6521	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time, with the environment posing constant challenges. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water, with no one to turn to for aid. The ghost town doesn’t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water, but it was completely barren. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abandoned, dashing his hopes for refreshment. This is how the features affect the cyclist, by presenting false promises and deepening his desperation throughout the journey.
544	6522	3	3	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water, creating a profound sense of dread. He went through three towns that had nothing, each empty location eroding his morale further. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope, and the vast, empty landscape seemed to offer no escape. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine, but the oppressive setting clouded his judgment and led him astray, a cautionary tale about the power of environment.
545	6523	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly throughout his journey. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in “the high deserts of California in June,” a brutal combination. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation, symbolizing the bleak and unforgiving nature of his surroundings. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally, as his spirit begins to break. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds, rattlesnakes and ghost towns, each new obstacle chipping away at his resolve. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope, feeling utterly defeated by the landscape. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally, demonstrating how environment can overwhelm an individual.
546	6524	3	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist, shaping his emotional and physical state throughout the journey. First, the setting at the middle of the story was empty and offered no place to get water, a desolation that filled the cyclist with profound doubt and despair as he thought he would die. The setting also made the cyclist intensely thirsty because of the extreme, unrelenting heat that seemed to press down from all sides. Finally, the cyclist was filled with a deep sense of regret because he regretted listening to the old men whose advice had led him astray, a bitter realization as the cyclist didn’t make it where he wanted to go and was left stranded in the harsh environment.
547	6525	3	3	The author thinks that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination, a feeling reinforced by the monotonous and barren landscape. However, he found out that there were still people around, a discovery that did not bring comfort but instead made him panic as he thought he was going to die. The places were completely deserted and he thought they led nowhere, offering no escape or salvation. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because everything around him was, in a sense, already dead, a chilling observation that underscored his own fragile mortality in the vast emptiness.
548	6526	3	3	The setting really affected the cyclist, imposing severe physical demands on his body. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired, a state of exhaustion which would come from the sun coming down on him with relentless intensity. You know he was hot where it said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” a vivid description that illustrated the extent of his dehydration and the physical toll of the journey through the arid, unforgiving landscape, leaving him drained and weary.
549	6527	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change, creating a constant and oppressive challenge. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert, a path that offered little shade or respite. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dangerously dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no clear sense of direction, lost in the vast, featureless terrain. Furthermore, the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn’t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself, a critical failure in the environment. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close does he finally get water, a moment of brief relief in his otherwise desperate situation.
550	6528	3	3	"The setting really affected the cyclist a lot, primarily through its harsh climatic conditions. The sun and hot weather dehydrated him, a serious problem as he had also pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops,"" a statement that shows he had drank almost all of his water and was facing a critical shortage. Then it says ""the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him profoundly, highlighting the direct and dangerous impact the environment had on his physical well-being and his fear of succumbing to the elements."
551	6529	3	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike on a quiet, shaded path. He was smiling and his legs were strong, propelling him forward with ease. As he hit the first town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water, the sight of decay mirroring his growing anxiety. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled, his energy waning with each new incline. When he saw a building he became happy, thinking he had found a place to rest, but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired, his hope deflating. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite, the simple guidance offering a new direction. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless, the harsh landscape draining his spirit. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him navigate the difficult journey ahead, providing a crucial lifeline.
552	6530	3	3	The setting of this story is very rigorous, testing the cyclist's endurance at every turn. At the beginning of the story the boy was fine, enjoying the morning air. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn’t get dehydrated, a sensible precaution for his trip. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel its full intensity because of the pines that shaded the road, and the cool feel of the river nearby. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out, his supply critically low. He had found a water pump, a potential source of relief. He got down on his knees and pulled the handle with all his might but all that came was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid, undrinkable and foul. He began to ride again, his thirst unquenched. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed, becoming more demanding. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter, the sun now relentless. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except for a few tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could freeze up from heatstrokes, a confusing and frightening thought. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight, a vast and empty landscape. Over one of the hills he saw a building came into view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes to make sure it was not a mirage. By the looks of it had been a Welch’s grape juice factory. He is so dehydrated and tired that he could see a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth, a cruel trick of his mind. There is only the problems it is abandoned, offering no real solace. This person was imagining things, his desperation creating visions. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into his mouth, a classic but futile trick. This was to help take his mind off being thirsty, a small distraction from his overwhelming need for water.
553	6531	3	3	I read “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie. In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by forcing him to accept advice from “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This interaction, born from the cyclist's encounter with the specific locale and its inhabitants, highlights how the environment directly shapes his journey and the decisions he must make along the way, ultimately influencing his path forward.
554	6532	3	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, creating a series of physical and mental challenges. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated, a constant source of discomfort. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” showing that the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist, relentlessly sapping his strength. Also, the hills of the country roads posed a significant obstacle. Going up and down hills take a lot of work; you have to use a lot of energy, which was in short supply. The cyclist says “flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills,” marking a difficult transition in his route. Furthermore, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit, adding a layer of fear to his travel. Again the cyclist states “diamondbacks blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me,” a vivid image of the danger. Finally, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes when he found it abandoned. The factory even made him more thirsty by reminding him of his need for a refreshing drink. In the end, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting, each feature contributing to his arduous experience on the road.
555	6533	3	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist, each element conspiring against his progress. For example, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly, leaving him vulnerable. As he “toiled” on, the terrain features became even more trying, the path growing more arduous. “Over one long, crippling hill…” By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting, the cumulative effect of the harsh environment pushing him to his absolute limit and leaving him utterly spent.
556	6534	3	3	The setting of this story has an encouraging impact on the narrative because it presents an alike ride, one that is both challenging and demanding. The terrain in the story sounds rough, as evidenced when he saw a sign marked, “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit.” He already has to navigate up and down steep hills littered with rocks and devoid of any water sources. Such a setting, combined with a really athletic ride, can be devastating, testing the very limits of his endurance and resolve as he pushes forward.
557	6535	3	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings aren’t that good, creating a series of incidents that are a significant problem for his journey. One major issue is the bad weather, with a temperature that makes it feel pretty close to @NUM1 degrees, creating an oppressive and draining heat. He stops at a water pump where water comes out, but it is really not cool and is utterly undrinkable. He takes two little sips and its taste is like battery acid, so foul that if he were to drink a lot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He desperately needs something because the next town is @NUM2 miles down the road, so he has to find a way to keep himself going. As he continues down the road he sees another sign: Rough Road Ahead, a warning that even though he is going only 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handlebars. If he does get thrown from his bike, he could run into the snake he saw earlier and then be too weak to move, left vulnerable. There are some interesting and tense scenes in the story that highlight his precarious situation.
558	6536	3	3	Heat, water supply, and energy are all critical features of the setting that can profoundly affect a cyclist. First, is the intense heat. When it is too warm out, it makes the ride more difficult, and more inconvenient, sapping strength with every pedal stroke. Second, is your water supply, a vital resource. If you are riding and begin to run low on water, you are in serious trouble, a point the author describes by stating, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” If you aren’t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient and dangerous when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is personal energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing left to give; your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. The author illustrates this, describing, “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” When you are completely out of energy, your ride is effectively over. Ultimately, all of these aspects are fundamentally important to consider before deciding to go on a demanding cycling journey.
559	6537	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by severely dehydrating him due to the relentless heat and the critical lack of available water, even causing him to see mirages. Furthermore, he steadily loses strength and stamina from the exertion of going over the many successive hills along his route. Adding to the danger, there is a very large snake he has to ride by, a creature that could have easily bitten him and ended his journey in disaster.
560	6538	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly because when you have numerous hills to climb and little water available, you will inevitably get dehydrated. Also, the extreme heat from the desert is so intense that it too can quickly make you dehydrated, compounding the physical strain. If you don't carefully pace yourself and if you don't ration your water, you will struggle to reach your goal. Your rest is also a big thing, for if you don't have enough energy from proper recovery, you will simply not get far on such a demanding journey.
561	6539	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the steep hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up, forcing him to push it instead, and he was afraid of the tall grass lining the path because it was tall and scary looking, obscuring his view of what might be hidden within. The physical challenges presented by the environment directly shaped his experience and emotional state during the journey.
562	6540	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit” a cyclist takes a long journey through difficult terrain to get to Yosemite. In that remote part of California there are not a lot of towns or people, creating a profound sense of isolation. The road he is riding on is very dangerous and long, with sharp curves and little shoulder. It is very dry and hot out there, with the sun beating down relentlessly on the cracked, pale earth, making his journey a true test of endurance.
563	6541	3	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways, influencing both their physical stamina and mental resolve. One way setting affects a cyclist is when it is hot, as the intense heat makes it harder to cycle long distances and leads to dangerous dehydration. I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” Another crucial part of setting that affects a cyclist is the specific terrain they cycle on. For example, it is much easier to cycle on flat, smooth ground than it is on rolling hills with rough, rocky ground that jolts the bike. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Ultimately, the setting can have a great deal of effect on a cyclist, depending on whether it is smooth or rocky, or hot and cool, fundamentally shaping the difficulty of the ride.
564	6542	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal, creating a series of survival challenges. Each feature causes the cyclist to act and adapt his plans accordingly. For example, in reaching the ‘ramshackle shed’ the cyclist finds the water unusable, which causes him to conserve his remaining water and try to head for the next town as quickly as possible. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during the intense heat of June. Also, as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed and effort to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every ‘shack or building he comes across for water, no matter how dilapidated. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot, demonstrating how the environment directly controls his fate.
565	6543	3	3	The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is about a great adventure gone bad, despite his initial preparations. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad when his supplies begin to run low. He gets low on water & the setting is horrible, a vast and unforgiving desert. He is on his way from a camp ground to the Yosemite river after receiving bad directions from old guys at the camp ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water; then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedaling over hills & becoming dehydrated; when he thought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got water & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story, he stuck it out & made it to the end, completing his arduous journey through the challenging landscape.
566	6544	3	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns ñ all are features of setting that profoundly affect the cyclist. First, the intense, unrelenting heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke under the scorching sun. He starts drinking more often to combat this, and consequently nearly runs out of his precious water supply. Next are the formidable hills. They can take massive amounts of energy and sustained effort to climb, which significantly adds to his physical strain and dehydration. Finally, the desolate ghost towns he passes through make his journey seem hopeless and isolating. Which could cause him to lose the crucial mental will to carry on through such a challenging landscape.
567	6545	3	3	The cyclist is in the desert which is over @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes harshly like battery acid, making it difficult to consume. The oppressive desert environment makes him see shimmering mirages and causes stinging sweat to constantly get into his eyes, further disorienting him. This challenging setting is a central element in the story ìDo Not exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, highlighting the physical toll of the journey.
568	6546	3	3	In the story, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the author tells a story about when he took advice from ìold folksî and consequently became lost on a remote road. The desolate setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example when he notes that ìtumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snakeÖî slithered by, and he faced a ìcrippling hillî that tested his resolve. These quotes explain that the setting was quite scary and intimidating, contributing to his sense of being lost and vulnerable in an unforgiving environment.
569	6547	3	3	Heís on a very hot climate, in a vast desert, so he needs lots of water to stay hydrated, but he has only a limited supply in his bottles. Heís riding on steep, rolling hills, which makes the physical exertion even harder and more draining on his energy. Furthermore, he canít find any towns that arenít abandoned, leaving him without hope of respite or replenishment. This combination of harsh elements creates a deeply challenging and isolating journey for the cyclist.
570	6548	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was the time it took because of the rough road; he had to go slower and more carefully, so it took him longer to get to the next town. Also, because the road was harder to peddle on, he got thirsty more quickly and found that the water in his bottle was really hot from the sun, offering little refreshment. These environmental obstacles worked together to slow his progress and increase his physical discomfort throughout the ride.
571	6549	3	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert, a landscape that was relentlessly dry and sun-scorched. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration, a physical struggle that defined his journey. Additionally, the town that was abandoned, with its empty buildings and silent streets, triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclistís mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope, a combination that wore him down further. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water, a dual torment that was almost unbearable. This abandoned juice factory, a place that should have offered salvation, almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope, and his was fading fast. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him, deepening his despair. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us that pushes him forward against the odds. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived such a punishing ordeal.
572	6550	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist profoundly, because he didnít know if he was going to die or live, a terrifying uncertainty that preyed on his mind. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry, a parched feeling that made every breath a reminder of his peril. The oppressive heat and the seemingly endless landscape created a situation where his survival was constantly in question, leaving him to grapple with fear and physical distress as he pressed on.
573	6551	3	3	In the short story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out, a constant anxiety that shadows his every move. Kurmaskie writes, ì I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking, a real and present danger in such an unforgiving climate. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration, a common yet dangerous adversary for anyone traveling through a desert environment. The story effectively illustrates how the harsh setting creates a central conflict centered on the body's most basic needs.
574	6552	3	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change, and landscapes are not immune to this truth. No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist exists than to be wary. Never travel advice home old-timers who haveníth confines of use porches, for their knowledge of the world may be as stationary as they are. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, a change that tested the cyclist's endurance and altered the journey's rhythm. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit, a warning that applied not just to velocity but to the pace of one's expectations in a shifting terrain. The journey itself became a lesson in adapting to the unexpected changes of the path.
575	6553	3	3	"Many things about the setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts, a challenging combination for any rider. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water, a thirst that grew with every arduous pedal stroke. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically, sapping his strength and his resolve. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is ìtarlikeî and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degreesî, a cruel disappointment that deepened his plight. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble, a testament to his powerful determination. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadnít left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him, their outdated knowledge proving to be a genuine hazard. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist, adding a layer of navigational peril to his physical struggles. The entire journey was a testament to his endurance against a hostile and misleading environment."
576	6554	3	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affects the cyclist in so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid-June, with the heat “beginning to beat down” on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Furthermore, the long distance and the significant changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling over affected him. The distance on which the cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park consisted of hours and miles of riding over vast changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” which affected the cyclist's speed and drained his energy to finish his trip, making his journey a grueling test of endurance.
577	6555	3	3	A response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him the wrong direction involves an old man he meets. One feature occurs when he travels through a ghost town. The old people in the town didn’t know the correct way and could not tell him. It made it harder for him because that wrong direction led to more difficult roads and less opportunity for water. He almost died as a direct result of this misleading information and the harsh conditions it led him into, highlighting the perilous nature of his journey.
578	6556	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly because the roads are hilly and he is old, so it is hard for him to ride up them, draining his limited strength. It was very hot and he had a scarce supply of water, which intensified his physical struggle. He was seeing things that weren’t there, a sign of his growing dehydration and heat exhaustion. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot, offering him no relief and deepening his desperate situation on the arduous trek.
579	6557	3	3	Some features of the setting like the intense heat are affecting the cyclist; for example, he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking too much of his water too quickly. So when he stopped at a place, the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old, rendering them unusable. Another feature was when he thought he could make it to the next town to get water there. He started his ride and the roads were hilly and short, which was challenging. Then the road turned bumpy, too. So no matter what, he was having bad trouble anyway, with each element of the setting conspiring against his progress.
580	6558	3	3	The character in this short story has a mood that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride he said, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name all over them,” showing his initial optimism and excitement. As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on, he becomes concerned and the terrain becomes rougher. This shift in the environment directly correlates with his fading morale, illustrating how his spirit is worn down by the increasing isolation and physical difficulty of the route.
581	6559	3	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, the desert is not a humid environment, making its lack of available water a bigger deal than normal, as dehydration sets in rapidly. Also, there are many hills making him have to use his full force to get up them, a strenuous effort that also makes water a big deal for maintaining his strength. In conclusion, if the temperatures were more level and it was flat land, he could undoubtedly go further with a much less substantial water supply, as the physical demands would be significantly reduced.
582	6560	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by teaching him to never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office. This is a crucial lesson because you don’t know if they are a real collection of reliable guides or simply what they claim to be. This is especially important after considering that some people genuinely have not left their porches for a very long time, since Carter was in office, and thus their knowledge of current routes is outdated. Ultimately, I don’t know why people have not left their porches since that time, but it clearly makes their advice unreliable for a modern journey.
583	6561	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water, just barely able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so intensely hot, him not having anything to drink, having nowhere to get water or food, and him maybe even seeing mirages due to his condition. In the essay it states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.” This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding harsh environment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the desert has him thinking he's seeing something and then letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many significant ways, impacting him physically and mentally beyond just one single hardship.
584	6562	3	3	In “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, I think that the setting affected the cyclist because he was desperately thirsty and he thought he was going to die. In this case, he had no water left and he was stranded in the vast desert. He was regretting not taking the advice of the stranger and was dying of thirst, a direct consequence of his surroundings. Also, he didn't have the mind set that he wanted to live, as the oppressive setting drained his will. That is how I think the setting affected him, by creating a life-threatening situation that broke his spirit.
585	6563	3	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and the arid area he is in. He says he is in the “high deserts of California in June.” Being hot in this region means the cyclist is surrounded by deserts, causing more intense and direct heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says, showing his distress. Being hot from the sun beating down on him relentlessly took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his critical lack of water. He mentions “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him profoundly tired and weak. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had immense trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. He observes that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, especially considering his pre-existing lack of water, and the overwhelming heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustrated because of their combined negative impact on his journey.
586	6564	3	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don’t think it does, especially for cyclists traveling anywhere or everywhere. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, there is a perfect example about how settings affect people like cyclists. When you’re riding your bike as actual cross country transportation, you have to know what you're doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route, leading him to a place that was not really a town anymore, a place with no water available. If you don’t have any water, like this guy did, the challenging hills could kill you. In such a case, you have to know what to do; for example, he gathered a few pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, having read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst. This guy knew a little bit of survival tips, which was crucial. If he’d gone all that way without a way to manage his thirst and the strain of those hills, he probably would have had some kind of physical crisis, such as a heat stroke. That is just one of the ways that a harsh setting could harm a traveler.
587	6565	3	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal on the road was beginning to lend down, but he truly noticed it only after about twenty miles up the road when he came to a park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June, a time of intense heat. He got on his hands and knees, working on the heated handle of a rusty pump he found there. After some effort, the pump began to shoot out a tar-like substance, and when the water finally came, it was scalding, feeling somewhere near two hundred degrees. Continuing on for two more miles, he noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a series of short, rolling hills. He said tumbleweeds crossed his path and a large snake crossed the pavement ahead of him. To combat his growing thirst, he gathered some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, recalling that sucking on stones helps to take your mind off thirst. After reading of his ordeal, it is clear these settings did profoundly effect the cyclist and his journey.
588	6566	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the “town” the cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town, a place devoid of the resources he needed. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long and arduous journey the cyclist has ahead of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist as he pressed on. For example, he noticed the terrain changing, as flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on, so this shift in geography significantly affected his stamina and will to keep going. He really had to push himself, using immense effort to trudge up and down each challenging hill. His determination finally led him to a place called “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp,” where he finally found hope and a chance for respite after his difficult trek.
589	6567	3	3	In the story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist grew increasingly tired because of the big hills he encountered, and the scenic view was the only good thing that he had going on. His situation was dire, as his water bottle only contained a few tantalizing sips, leaving him without enough water and plagued by thirst. Furthermore, the environment presented physical dangers; at some point, a ridiculously large snake, one that really did look like a diamondback, blocked the majority of the pavement ahead of him. It is a dangerous place where he was riding, and even though he was on a bike, he could have been bitten by the venomous creature. All of these points I made clearly showed the negative affect the setting had on his journey and well-being.
590	6568	3	3	The desert-like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and causing a loss of body water through the intense heat, which therefore made him desperately need water to go on. I think the psychological thought of being so thirsty, constantly on his mind, made him become even more weak and fatigued. If he wasn’t thinking about his thirst and dehydration so intensely, the mental burden would have been lighter and the ride wouldn't have been so rough, demonstrating how the environment impacts both body and spirit.
591	6569	3	3	In the cyclist’s outlook on his journey through Yosemite’s park, readers can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride, offering a vivid and immersive experience. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rushing rivers and expansive, sandy dry deserts, as well as the cool shade of pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature, enhancing the overall pleasantness of his ride through the diverse landscape.
592	6570	3	3	The features of the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist profoundly. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water, creating a harsh and unforgiving environment. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite, significantly slowing his progress. In this case the author says “The sun was beating down on me,” conveying the intense, relentless heat. The author is hot from the sun, and his suffering is compounded by thirst. He says “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” highlighting his desperate situation. He is showing how he has no water and is probably dehydrated, with his physical state deteriorating. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water, presenting a serious challenge to his journey.
593	6571	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way, testing his endurance. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay, adding a physical challenge to his trek. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him, draining his remaining energy. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it, his spirits crushed by the slow pace. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony, mocking his thirst. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist, a welcome respite. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait,” showing his profound gratitude for this small sign of civilization. All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end, making his journey a true test of will.
594	6572	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist significantly throughout his arduous journey. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off, its intensity overwhelming. It caused him to go dehydrated because of a lack of water and he went kind of delirious, his mind beginning to play tricks on him. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted, a clear sign of his physical distress. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was undrinkable because of the tar-like substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree, rendering it a useless, foul liquid. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed, and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice, a cruel reminder of his own deprivation. Not only did the cyclist get off track because of the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable, compounding his difficulties at every turn.
595	6573	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, shaping his difficult experience. First is that it is very hot in the desert, with the sun creating an oppressive and draining atmosphere. Second is that there aren’t many towns out there, leading to a profound sense of isolation on the long, empty roads. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he got thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn’t find a town, turning a basic need into a constant preoccupation. These combined factors created a formidable challenge for his journey through the arid landscape.
596	6575	3	3	The setting profoundly affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the desert, where the sun beats down relentlessly. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times, shifting from flat stretches to more demanding paths. Because the day is intensely hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out, leaving him vulnerable. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank so frequently he very quickly ran out of his supply. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that because the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those inclines. And because this physical exertion caused him to become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road on a cool day. In conclusion, the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which critically affects his entire journey.
597	6576	3	3	The features of the setting in the story significantly affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere, creating a harsh, arid environment. There also aren’t many places to cool off at, with little shade available for relief. They also described the water and Lodi to be about ninety degrees in temperature, which is exceptionally warm. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the oppressive heat and to have a cool, shady place under pine trees to sit under, and to find cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat, making his journey a struggle for basic comfort and survival.
598	6577	3	3	"The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist, dictating the challenges he must overcome. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow to keep from dehydration, using the environment to their advantage. If the cyclist in, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", was cycling in winter time, he would not have been so thirsty all of the time, as the cold weather reduces the body's demand for water. Also if the whole ride was down hill, he would not be so tired, as the terrain would require less physical exertion. The specific conditions of heat and arduous terrain are therefore central to the cyclist's plight in this particular narrative."
599	6578	3	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous, presenting multiple hazards. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (Kurmaskie). There was a rather large snake in his path, creating a direct physical obstacle. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it, adding to the tension of the encounter. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated, a constant and draining condition. His water supply is almost gone, leaving him with little recourse. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey, and the setting provided them in abundance, from wildlife to extreme thirst.
600	6579	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self-determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths in order to reach their destination, testing their physical limits. For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are bound to reach some rough spots where it seems you can’t walk any further. But that is where self-determination kicks in, providing the mental fortitude to continue. The power to keep yourself moving even though there may be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end is crucial. Another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don’t have the right supplies to keep yourself energised you can’t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything. This is why the features of the setting so profoundly affect the cyclist, intertwining physical challenge with mental resolve.
601	6580	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” the harsh terrain exerts a profoundly negative effect on the author. He notes, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” which illustrates his rapid consumption of water, a direct consequence of the oppressive summer desert heat. After traveling for a long time with his water supply depleted, he lets out a hopeless chuckle, reflecting on his mistake in taking the old men's advice. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This moment serves as a powerful example of how severely the terrain had worn him down, to the point where he ironically applauds his own remaining capacity for self-pity, demonstrating the complete mental toll of the journey.
602	6581	3	3	The specific features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist, who is already tired and thirsty from his journey. The environment is a desert in California, characterized by extreme, relentless heat and a complete absence of any signs of civilization, creating a sense of profound isolation. Furthermore, the roads are not flat but consist of constant, unending hills that roll throughout the desert landscape, adding a grueling physical challenge. On top of these difficult facts, the cyclist is actively dehydrating because his water supply has supposedly diminished, leaving him in a precarious and desperate situation as he confronts the unforgiving elements.
603	6582	3	3	"The setting of the shortcut significantly affected the cyclist in several detrimental ways. For instance, when he found a source of rusty water, he discovered that ""it tasted like battery acid,"" and because of this terrible quality, he was unable to drink it, which directly contributed to his worsening dehydration. Additionally, the text states that ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills,"" a change that would have made the journey even more physically demanding for the cyclist, as he now had to exert considerably more effort to ascend each incline. One final example occurs towards the end of his ordeal, when he says, ""I began breaking my ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself I could make it there."" This statement reveals a psychological breaking point, making it seem as though he had nearly given up and was confronting a feeling that the journey was an endless struggle for survival. That is how the setting of the story ultimately affected the cyclist, both physically and mentally."
604	6583	3	3	Several distinct features of the setting negatively affected the cyclist. The challenging rolling hills, the threatening presence of a poisonous snake, and the poor, worrying conditions of the road all contributed to her anxiety. For example, the cyclist said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.” The cyclist expressed a high degree of doubt and despair when saying that quote, clearly not believing she would ever make it through the difficult journey. Finally, after persevering, she reached another destination, only to find herself once again in the position of asking another older man for directions, highlighting the cyclical and disheartening nature of her experience.
605	6584	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist, both hindering and helping his progress. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into “short, rolling hills.” These hills significantly increase the physical difficulty of the ride and are a primary source of his doubt that he will successfully make it to his destination. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was the fact that he was in a desolate desert, observing that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” which intensified his feelings of isolation. However, the horizon itself was what ultimately kept the cyclist going. He explains, “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” This visible goal on the horizon kept him hopeful and determined to continue. Without the challenging setting, he would not have been in such a serious predicament, but luckily, in the end, it was this same setting that provided the visual markers which helped him be determined enough to persevere and complete his journey.
606	6585	3	3	I guess safety really comes first, and you have to be cautious when you are out in the streets on a bicycle, always watching for cars and pedestrians. I really don’t understand much about the deeper mechanics or the rules of the road, so I can’t write much more on the subject beyond this simple, fundamental point. It is a basic but essential truth for any cyclist.
607	6586	3	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence in their knowledge of the area. He biked to the first town but it was like a “ghost town,” completely silent and still. A town is a town, but this one felt utterly empty, and soon after that, he did not see anything at all. No cars, no buildings, or anything else on the horizon. He was getting profoundly sad and dangerously dehydrated under the relentless sun. The old men had sworn there was a town coming up, so he put his trust and confidence in them once again, pushing forward. He saw a building coming up in the distance, but it was just an old, worn-down factory with broken windows. He thought he was let down, his hope crumbling. He was sure he was going to die, right there and right now, alone on that barren road. He then saw a sign for a fish company! He was overjoyed, a surge of relief washing over him! The place was real, too, a bustling hub of activity! He thought of the people there as his savior, his deliverance from certain doom! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously, shaping his entire journey from despair to salvation.
608	6587	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist, challenging him at every turn. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didn’t come out, leaving him parched. “...working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out….” (Kurmaskie), dashing his hopes for a drink. Another example is when he came across rolling hills that tested his endurance, and the scaring heat that beat down upon him, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement, blocking his path and adding danger to his arduous trip. These environmental obstacles collectively defined the difficulty of his ride.
609	6588	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist profoundly; if it is just a narrow path between buildings and cars the cyclist won't be able to break free and bicycle freely, feeling confined and pressured. A cluttered urban environment restricts movement and creates constant hazards, while an open road offers liberation. So it can affect him, determining whether his ride is one of constraint or one of effortless flow, showing how deeply the surroundings influence the cycling experience from start to finish.
610	6589	3	3	The setting in the story was intensely hot, with a sun that beat down mercilessly. The biker was sweating a lot, his clothes soaked through with the effort of his journey. The whole town was empty, devoid of any life or activity. He passed empty buildings with dusty windows and silent doors. There were rivers that he could not drink from and big hills that he had to ride through, each climb a test of his will. As it says about the buildings, “somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope,” capturing his profound sense of desolation. The setting would affect the cyclist because there was no one in the town to offer help or direction. Also, there were high hills that drained his energy and spirit, making his passage a true trial of physical and mental fortitude in the face of overwhelming emptiness.
611	6590	3	3	The harsh features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist during his journey. He was riding across the California desert in the month of June, a time of intense and relentless heat. There was no water to be found in the arid landscape, so he had to carefully ration the limited supply he carried with him. He says the sun began taking harder runs and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. These hills made him work much harder, which dehydrated him quicker. Since there was no water source in the vast desert, he faced the very real and dangerous possibility of dying from dehydration before reaching his destination.
612	6591	3	3	When you are with your family in Ocean City biking down the boardwalk, your only obstacle is the crowd of people. When you are in a race on winding roads, you could face lots of different obstacles. The weather itself could be your greatest obstacle of all. You could pass out from a lack of water and the scorching heat. You could fall over from slippery roads made treacherous by the rain. Along with that, nature could lay its toll upon you, as illustrated by the encounter where “a ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement.” Just like that unexpected serpent, you never know what you could come across on a long and unpredictable ride.
613	6592	3	3	Many of the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist on his arduous journey. The cyclist is biking through vast, unforgiving deserts where the conditions are extreme. The quote, “a ridiculously large snake,” shows that not only is the weather and climate against him, but nature itself presents direct dangers. Another great quote, “I could drop from heat stroke,” powerfully shows how hot it truly is where the cyclist is riding. The description, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” provides a stark image of the isolated and deserted area he must traverse. Furthermore, the statement, “The bottle only contained a few tantalising sips,” reveals the cyclist is critically low on water in the desert, a situation that could quickly become fatal. The above quotes really draw you in, allowing you to see the many challenging features of the setting and what it is truly like for the cyclist struggling against them.
614	6593	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in many significant ways. First in the essay, when the author says he is in the deserts of California, that setting affects him because it immediately conveys how hot it most likely was out there and how a lack of water can truly harm someone in such an environment. Also when the author describes the water pumps and what comes out of them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and a powerful reminder to always keep a good water supply on hand during such demanding travels through harsh lands.
615	6594	3	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affected the cyclist throughout his long and difficult journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a desert without a good supply of water, making every mile a test of endurance. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the sheer length of his journey, stretching on under the relentless sun. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist, pushing him to his physical limits."
616	6595	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the severe lack of water and the fact that he was in the high deserts of California. The extreme aridity and heat of the environment directly impacted his physical state. For example, in the text it stated “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” That showed clearly that when he tried to get water from a pump, what came out was undrinkable, as the setting was extremely hot and made the cyclist miserable in such ways, exacerbating his desperate thirst and highlighting the unforgiving nature of the landscape.
617	6596	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on in such a harsh and isolated environment. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there, no resources or shelter to provide relief. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through the vast, empty terrain does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could go, leading him astray. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn't going to make it. When he finally got to “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp,” he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he knew the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map, realizing then the importance of relying on his own tools rather than unreliable advice.
618	6597	3	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist withstood the blazing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the desert's living room: dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June,” a thought which depicts the intense heat of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the ever-hanging hills and steep slopes; though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well as maneuvering the twists and bends, served as a direct conflict. An example, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a sharp turn,” shows how the setting can affect a situation. Ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination in great relief, but the biggest hindrance was undoubtedly the challenging setting he had to traverse.
619	6598	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplest challenges into significant obstacles for him. The barren and unforgiving landscape presented constant difficulties that tested his endurance. The lack of water and the snake in his path are prime examples of how the environment created direct physical threats and complications. These features of the setting continually worked against him, turning his journey into a relentless struggle for survival.
620	6599	3	3	First, by accepting the old men’s advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would have easily avoided by using his map. He first encounters a “ghost town,” a place that was lifeless and, most importantly, waterless, offering no respite. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like “battery acid,” a bitter disappointment. Next he rides past a “Rough Road Ahead” sign; not the most encouraging thing on his difficult journey. To add to the despair, he has to maneuver his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory, a cruel reminder of his thirst. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp.” To him, this simple bait shop was like a beacon of hope, providing a much-needed refuge from the harsh realities of the road.
621	6600	3	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the beginning, the cyclist was sure of himself, and he decided to ask some old men that looked like they hadn't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert, sending him down a long, dusty road. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization whatsoever, just an endless expanse of sand and scrub. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him; he kept going, pushing through the fatigue, and eventually he came upon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest, finally finding relief from his arduous journey.
622	6601	3	3	Through most of the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned, with its buildings empty and windows dark. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, its machinery silent and still, so he hung his head and that blues tune “summer time” rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst, a constant and painful dryness in his throat. So he stuck some pebbles in his mouth to take his mind off it, a desperate attempt to create saliva. Then he thought about how lucky he’d be if he checked his water bottle and found some left, a thought that seemed profoundly negative to me given his circumstances.
623	6602	3	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many ways because he is getting tired, and is drinking more and more water from his dwindling supply. The roads are getting rough and uneven, so he needs to slow down his pace considerably. If he slows down, he will get tired more quickly and will need more water, although he is all out on top of that. Furthermore, the old men really didn't know what they were talking about, and their misleading directions compounded the problem. Ultimately, the various features of the landscape and his situation profoundly affect the cyclist's physical state and morale.
624	6603	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unbearable, beating down on him during this long ride with an unrelenting intensity. The fact that he had nowhere around him to fill up his water bottle added to his growing desperation. So he was dying of thirst, his throat parched and cracked, and he didn't know where he was going or how far he had to go, which filled him with a sense of hopelessness. The setting, with its harsh and unforgiving nature, was crucial in this story, directly shaping the cyclist's difficult experience and his struggle to persevere.
625	6604	3	3	The setting in the beginning of the story is flat and easy, allowing for a smooth and confident ride. But as the path becomes unfamiliar, it turns into many hills and sharp turns, making the journey much more demanding. This affects the cyclist a lot because he was already low on water and was beginning to become dehydrated, with each new climb sapping his remaining strength. The challenging terrain thus intensified his physical struggle, pushing him to his limits as he pressed on.
626	6605	3	3	The desolate setting profoundly affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind, shadows and mirages playing tricks on his vision. Passing there is rolling around him, a vast emptiness that makes him start to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs is going to right way, no indication that he is anything but lost in an unforgiving landscape.
627	6606	3	3	The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles on his arduous journey. For example, there is a snake in his path, a coiled danger on the sun-baked asphalt, so he cationly rides around it, giving it a wide berth. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasnít sure if he could make it up those steep, grueling slopes. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration under the relentless sun. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal through sheer will and perseverance.
628	6607	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Aheadî the author goes through many seneries of a harsh and unforgiving landscape. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite, his promised land. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further, even as his strength wanes. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then seeís a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down, a small outpost that signifies his salvation.
629	6608	3	3	The distinct features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling, weighing heavily on his spirit. They changed his hope to doubt, a gradual erosion of his confidence. There were no buildings or cars, only an endless expanse of wilderness, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain of cracked earth and jagged rock that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine, but here he was utterly alone.
630	6609	3	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope—all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you canít put anything back in your skin and your body canít function without water finally dwinding his physical reserves. Hope, the cyclist didnít think he was going to live through this ordeal, his mind clouded with despair. He tried hard and pushed himself through the suffering and success was made in the end. He lived to see another day.
631	6610	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he gets tired. The character in the story is riding his bike for a long period of time and he gets physically exhausted. He rides alone with nothing and no one around him except the trees and wild animals, which adds to his sense of isolation and fatigue. The relentless solitude and the unchanging natural landscape contribute to his growing weariness as he continues his journey. This constant physical demand in an empty environment ultimately takes its toll on the rider.
632	6611	3	3	The features of the setting make the journey for the cyclist is rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, and amount of water. The hills give you a breeze going down but going up give you a hard time, demanding great physical effort. The snakes can hurt you by biting, presenting a direct danger. The heat could make you sick from overexposure, and the insufficient amount of water can really hurt you by causing severe dehydration. Each of these natural elements combines to create a harsh and challenging ride through the environment.
633	6612	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed, which dictates his pace. Due to how the setting is, the cyclist has a rough hill with which to contend, making his progress difficult. The terrain itself, marked by this significant incline, directly challenges his stamina and speed. This demonstrates how the physical landscape governs the experience of the ride, imposing its own conditions on the journey.
634	6613	3	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water to maintain his energy. There are obstacles in the road too, such as the big snake laying across the middle of the road, which forces him to stop. He is lost without water and could possibly die of a heatstroke under the intense sun. These combined challenges from the environment create a serious situation for the cyclist, threatening his well-being on the isolated path.
635	6614	3	3	The cyclist knew what he was getting himself into, so if he needed water or anything like that, it was probably his own fault; he should have brought some with him. He was aware of the challenging conditions of the route beforehand and the necessity of carrying supplies. His failure to prepare adequately for the journey's demands, such as packing enough water, was a personal oversight. Therefore, the difficulties he now faces are largely a consequence of his own lack of preparation for the ride.
636	6615	3	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The “deserts of California in June” with their intense, dry heat caused him to be weary very easily, sapping his energy as he pedaled. The terrain change from the flat road to steep, unrelenting hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph, a speed he could never hope to reach. He could only go a fraction of that speed, struggling up each incline. Finally, the large snake created a direct obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist, forcing him to a halt. All of these environmental features affected the cyclist in some way, challenging his physical endurance and mental resolve throughout his arduous trip.
637	6616	3	3	The story is basically talking about how more people with cars should ride bicycles to work or to school’s so it want be alot of polution in the air. By choosing to cycle for short daily trips instead of driving, individuals can help reduce the amount of harmful emissions released from vehicles. This simple change in transportation habits would lead to cleaner air in our cities and towns. Consequently, the overall level of air pollution would decrease, benefiting everyone's health and the environment. Therefore, adopting cycling as a regular mode of transit is presented as a practical and effective solution to a significant environmental problem.
638	6617	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The extreme temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water, causing him to consume it too quickly which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The “towns” he comes to are so deserted and empty he thinks he is going in the wrong direction, fueling his sense of isolation. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going, pushing him forward through the adversity. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it, proving his perseverance was ultimately successful.
639	6618	3	3	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him, which shifted from flat plains to challenging hills. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist, such as a large snake blocking his path. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around, creating a constant threat of dehydration. Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information about the road ahead. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would wear & fear on his physical & mental strengths, testing his determination and resilience to their limits throughout the journey.
640	6619	3	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early summer. And third he was traveling through the deserts, an environment known for its harsh conditions. So if you put all of that together, he was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These factors all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end, a critical mistake in his planning. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough, illustrating how the setting directly dictated his survival strategies and his ultimate physical condition.
641	6620	3	3	"The features of the text affect the understanding of the setting because in some ways they can throw you off a little with other lines, and then you will get confused about what the author is actually talking about. The littlest thing that could throw you off is the specific line when it says ""before the last world war."" That kind of phrasing throws me off a little because it creates a vague temporal reference, making the historical context of the setting less precise and more difficult to immediately place, which momentarily disrupts the reader's immersion in the narrative."
642	6621	3	3	"The setting that was affecting the cyclist was primarily the lack of water he had because it says “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" which directly indicates his scarce supply. The text also says "" I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate."" He wouldn’t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn't genuinely thirsty and suffering from dehydration in that harsh environment. This detail underscores how the arid setting was a constant physical and mental challenge for him during his journey."
643	6622	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly because it was June and the cyclist had little water to begin with. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn't find any building or source of water for many miles across the barren landscape. Furthermore, the cyclist took advice from old-timers which didn’t know what they were talking about, leading him further into difficulty. In conclusion, the combination of the hot weather and the remote location profoundly affected the cyclist's physical state and his chances of finding relief.
644	6623	3	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain, through hills, high desert, flat roads, and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of a bunch of old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare, leading him through a much more demanding and isolated route. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all under the scorching sun. The setting of this story changed a lot, making the cyclist at times have to pedal faster and slower to adapt to the inclines and surfaces. The cyclist was quickly worn out from the exertion and started to lose hope in himself as his energy faded. The terrain kept changing, making it hard for him not to be thirsty and exacerbating his dehydration. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke in that desolate place. As he came up over a long hill, he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink, vowing never to listen to a bunch of old guys again after his harrowing experience.
645	6624	3	3	"The features of the setting initially make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip, filling him with optimism. This is what the text says, “what I shouldn’t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a ‘shortcut’ that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also talks about not taking directions from old timers, a lesson he learns too late. This is when the text says he realizes the folly of trusting such advice without verification, ultimately leading him into difficulty and showing how the social setting of encountering misguided locals directly impacted his journey for the worse."
646	6625	3	3	During the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go, leading him down a longer, more arduous path. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy a lot quicker than usual, leaving him feeling weak and lightheaded. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The intense sun made him sweat profusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use, as it was quickly expelled without providing proper hydration. These combined obstacles made his progress frustratingly slow and physically taxing.
647	6626	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, he was in the California desert in June, a time of year known for its extreme temperatures. The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated, pass out, or even die, creating a constant state of risk. There are not many sources of water in the deserts, making every sip from his dwindling supply a precious resource. The terrain didn’t help him much either; the steep hills use a lot of energy and made him perspire, causing him to lose fluid from his body at an alarming rate. The cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting, which posed a continuous challenge to his endurance and resolve.
648	6627	3	3	The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and “rushing rivers” filled him with optimism; he is very confident with the old men's directions. This first sign of disappointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...” and the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on despite his growing doubts. He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea, his initial confidence eroding with each difficult pedal stroke. Finally he comes to an old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from gives him a moment of relief from the harsh desert he had just been riding through, a brief sanctuary that restored a small measure of his spirit.
649	6628	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was hard to ride on, with its uneven surfaces and steep inclines, there was intense heat from the unrelenting sun, and little water available to replenish his strength. As a result, it was a long trip and he had a difficult time reaching his destination, each mile requiring immense physical effort and mental fortitude. The journey became a true test of his endurance against the formidable natural environment.
650	6629	3	3	At first the trip was easy going and flat, allowing for a pleasant and steady pace. It was a nice day out and the water supply was draining slowly but steadily from his bottles. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough, challenging his muscles and his resolve. Even though the pines gave shade it wasn’t enough to help the cyclist combat the oppressive heat that seemed to radiate from the ground itself. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and a long bicycle trip through the woods, finally spotting a building that promised a respite from his arduous journey.
651	6630	3	3	"The essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" is about the dangers of speed and assault. It is just letting you know to follow instructions and read signs. You should always keep a close watch for signs and things like warning symbols or posted speed limits. These indicators are placed for your safety and to alert you to potential hazards on the road ahead. Ignoring them can lead to accidents or other dangerous situations, so paying attention is crucial for a safe journey."
652	6631	3	3	The setting that affected the cyclist was water temperature, rolling hills, and the condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he needed cool water to keep him hydrated, and he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water; it was hot, but he took it. He tried to let it cool down, but it did not, which failed to quench his thirst. Rolling hills was another contributor to the cyclist's hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up, which can strain the legs and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition; it was smooth at first then it became rough and rocky. Those were some of the challenges the cyclist had to overcome on his difficult journey.
653	6632	3	3	The setting depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist by providing a destination, but the up hills did not help him. The cyclist got a bad idea or attitude when he saw the towns; he was upset and mad because he did not want to die and yet he thought he was going to. He said he would not trust old men anymore, as they did not know what they were talking about. This reflection shows how his difficult experience changed his perspective and made him question the guidance he had received initially.
654	6633	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him difficulty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling,"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly, an example of the setting that helps show the character's hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" If anything were to happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he would be stranded and all alone to die. He would be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion, these examples added emphasis and meaning to the text, illustrating the perilous nature of his journey."
655	6634	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a lot of ways. For instance, when his water was too hot to drink, he got some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that, it will dilute your spit and help with dryness. Furthermore, the terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly, creating a physically demanding path for his ride. These environmental features presented significant physical challenges that the cyclist had to endure throughout his journey.
656	6635	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist, presenting a series of physical challenges. The hills affected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride, forcing him to expend more energy with each steep ascent. The abandoned town also affected him profoundly. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break, but when he got there the town was abandoned, offering no respite. Also, the highway was hard for him because it would be difficult for him to ride on the rough, cracked pavement under the relentless sun. Furthermore, there was nowhere that he could get water around him, intensifying his struggle. Many features of the setting affected him, creating a journey defined by hardship and isolation.
657	6636	3	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger, building his frustration step by step. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of these sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to become frightened and neurotic, his initial optimism fading. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid,” making it nearly undrinkable. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance, each pedal stroke becoming a greater effort. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,” a cruel irony that pushed him over the edge. The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that he hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting that have systematically broken his spirit.
658	6637	3	3	The features in the setting most definitely affect the cyclist while he travels, shaping his desperate state of mind. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really, offering only barren landscapes. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living, a place of empty buildings and silence. This first encounter with isolation in a desolate place doesn’t really affect him deeply because it is the first place he finds, but the rest of the story's setting comes to mimic this initial disappointment. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight, a vast emptiness that stretches on. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he will soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet, a real and pressing danger. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive, a symbol of his ultimate frustration. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he doesn’t find water, and convey a profound sense of desolation.
659	6638	3	3	The setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California, a landscape that directly influenced the narrative. This setting affected the character's mood, creating a powerful connection between environment and emotion. It did this because some of its included features can seem as actual metaphorically based moods, reflecting his internal state. An example from the story is, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...” this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed, a stark contrast to his current harsh reality. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood, illustrating how the physical world shapes his psychological experience.
660	6639	3	3	The features of the setting that affect a cyclist depend on where they are located, defining the nature of the challenge. In this story the feeling of “nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope,” creating an atmosphere of utter desolation. It all depends on where you are cycling, as the environment dictates the struggle. “It didn’t really matter I was going to die.” This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dying of thirst, revealing his complete despair. He felt nothing; he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised, showing how a single change in the setting can dramatically alter one's fate and outlook.
661	6640	3	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. The sheer isolation and the relentless sun beating down on the empty road scared him, which made him push himself to go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die; the intense thirst and heat made him feel weak and dizzy. The snake in the way caused him to slow down and navigate carefully, costing him more time, and every stop that had once been there, now abandoned, effected him to feel a deeper sense of hopelessness on his difficult journey.
662	6641	3	3	I would think even riding a bike for so long can be bad for the behind, causing soreness and discomfort from the constant pressure on the saddle. But it is also good exercising, especially for the legs, building all the strength you get from the muscle as you pedal for miles. To know where you are going could take forever if you are lost or on an unfamiliar, winding route. But I do know what they would have to face: all types of weather, from scorching sun to pouring rain, but as long as you have the proper gear on, like a raincoat or padded shorts, no serious harm could come to you during the ride.
663	6642	3	3	At first he was mad because he took advise from old men who never left their porch, realizing their guidance was based on outdated memories. He got scared he was going to die because he had drunk all his water too soon and he didn’t know how long it would be till he got some more, leaving his throat parched and his mind anxious. He shouldn’t have drank his water so quickly, knowing he had a while to go across the vast, arid landscape. Then he became happy and relieved when he saw the bait sign, a promise of civilization and a chance to replenish his supplies. He biked quickly down the hill, his spirits lifted by the sight of potential rescue.
664	6643	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening, filled with signs of a harsh, unforgiving environment. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel,” highlighting the irony of the unattainable speed for a man on a bicycle. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike, the sign mocks his slow progress. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path, adding to the danger. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it without provoking a strike. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired, sapping his remaining energy. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight, emphasizing the desolation. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist throughout his arduous trip.
665	6644	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his journey. It made him become dehydrated from the relentless heat and the absence of any sources for replenishment. For example, in the text he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and worn down, leading to him getting dehydrated and physically compromised. The setting of the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story by presenting a series of environmental challenges that test his endurance and will to continue.
666	6645	3	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot day now in California while the narrator is aiding his ride. This causes him to become dehydrated much faster while he is on a “Short cut” leading to no where. “Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June.” This gust shows how that calm day really was not so calm, and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling up and down them so often, it secured his difficult journey. It cowed him to the side of the road even longer in getting to a town with water. The deserted knowns in the setting also negatively affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless feeling in his narration because there was no place to stop and he was depleting his water supply, increasing his sense of isolation and fatigue.
667	6646	3	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, and Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he realized his water bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot and not cool out there, and then the terrain changed, becoming more demanding. He no longer had that much water, which heightened his anxiety. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a diamondback, startling him. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through a series of ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, and with nothing around you at all it can be very dangerous, even fatal. Before you bike, think of what conditions are ahead of you and prepare accordingly for a safer journey.
668	6647	3	3	His journey was difficult because he was trying to make it through the night to go and he felt it deeply because he was driving to soil and because he was driving 55 mph per hour and then slowing to 12 mph on the rough terrain. The constant struggle and the harsh conditions made the trip feel endless, and sometimes life can feel so cruel in life, ya dig, and that is all I can say right now about the exhausting nature of such an endeavor.
669	6648	3	3	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn’t very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point, indicating his disappointment. This shows that he’s getting frustrated and losing some hope for a proper respite. He also mentions that the “sight was troubling” which shows how big of an affect the features around him or the barren scenery can have on his morale and will to continue.
670	6649	3	3	Lots of features in the setting play an affect on a cyclist. Some that @MONTH1 plays an affect are the intense heat, the flat road that’s hard to ride on due to monotony, or how there is a lack of services or shelter along the route, all of which can combine to create a challenging and potentially hazardous trip for anyone on a bicycle.
671	6650	3	3	This essay is an American tale that expresses how hard it is to do something, but to do it through determination. The cyclist is faced with many changes, not only physically but also mentally. The landscape was barren and empty; there was no one in sight, not a building or anything for miles. As this rider comes to think about the substantial beating he took from the ride, he is tired and, with no sight of the town of Baidi, says he might not be able to do it. His body aches and his spirit wanes, yet a flicker of resolve pushes him to continue, embodying the story's core message of perseverance against overwhelming hardship.
672	6651	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all, he is travelling through a desert in California in June, so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water. However, as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water source, so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, it frustrates him that when he does find water, not only is it hot, it tastes like battery acid. When the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more, there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor that the cyclist cannot go more than 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town, he still will have to wait longer for the much-needed water, travelling at this slow, arduous pace. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus, his major concern remains the critical and debilitating lack of water, which dictates his every thought and action.
673	6652	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first it was a bright, shiny day and the cyclist was happy, full of energy for his journey. He reaches the first town, which is a ghost town, and the desolation there makes him sad. Riding on, he begins to lose water, and the once bright, shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist mercilessly. He reached a ramshackle shed and, finding no relief, began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated with every passing mile. The terrain becomes slopes and hills, and the ride becomes harder, sapping his remaining strength. When he reached the grape drink factory, his hopes were almost gone, the disappointment profound. But just over the hill was a fishing shop, a sight that revived his spirit. He used his remaining energy to speed down the hill to get water and, in doing so, managed to get his energy back, concluding his arduous trial.
674	6653	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” the features of this setting are making the cyclist determined and hopeful for a rewarding journey. Another example is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting here are making him brave and courageous as he navigates the sudden danger. The last example is when it says, “I hung my head.” The features of this setting, a vast and unforgiving emptiness, are making the cyclist have despair and feel defeated. That is how the various features of the setting affect the cyclist throughout his challenging experience."
675	6654	3	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affected both positively and negatively by the setting. Setting is the surroundings in which the story takes place. In the story, a cyclist loses his way and is put in danger because of it. The setting of the story can be described as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author describes the setting by saying, “two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” The change in terrain made it more difficult for the cyclist, challenging his endurance. However, he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost there. He told himself that he’d make it if he made it over the next hill, using the geography as a motivational goal. Ultimately, the setting of the story gave the cyclist both hope and problems in his journey to survive, defining the dual nature of his struggle.
676	6655	3	3	The cyclist was profoundly affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men whose information was not accurate, leading him astray. Then he cycled along the vast desert which was oppressively hot and unforgiving. He had a limited supply of water, a situation that also affected him in a very bad way, causing both physical distress and mental anxiety. He almost had a heat stroke a few times, his vision swimming under the intense sun. He was probably angry and frustrated that he took these men’s advice and got himself into this perilous situation. Then when he finally found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief, a wave of gratitude washing over him. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place, a thought that surely nagged at him. So it’s really confusing because he probably felt relieved and mad at the same time, a conflict of intense emotions. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn’t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke, a cycle of misery he was desperate to avoid.
677	6656	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the incredible rush he or she got when speeding down the hill, a sensation of pure freedom. The fresh morning air, crisp and cool, combined with the feeling of no limits just you and your feet on the pedals, creates an unparalleled experience. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest from the exertion and excitement, defines the moment. There are no boundaries, a sense that you can go where you like, when you like, charting your own path. There are no people to get in the way of you and your need for speed, no obstacles to interrupt the fluid connection between rider, machine, and the open road. This complete immersion in the physical act of cycling and the surrounding environment culminates in a perfect, fleeting moment of liberation.
678	6657	3	3	"In the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" it is clearly shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the entire narrative. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike, a test of his endurance. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him, shaping his perceptions and his physical state. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old, abandoned towns and the barren desert places; he even says that ""The sight was troubling,"" indicating a growing unease. As he continues to California in June the relentless heat and the long, arduous journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically, wearing him down. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength,"" a moment of desperate effort. The quote shows because he is biking so long and is looking for water and there is not a town in sight he becomes weak and although he is determined to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the harsh setting he is placed in. The environment acts as a constant antagonist, challenging his resolve at every turn."
679	6658	3	3	"The elements of ""directions, June, lack of water"" are all critical factors that effect the rider on his ride, each compounding the others. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut, a decision based on misplaced trust. It turned out that their short cut was wrong, leading him into difficulty instead of out of it. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California, a time of year known for its intensity. It would have been burning hot, the sun beating down without mercy. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip, his supply dwindling as his thirst grew. He could have died from dehydration if he didn’t find the other water source, a fact that highlights the gravity of his situation. These were some of the primary elements that effected the rider on his trip, demonstrating how external circumstances can dictate the success and safety of a personal endeavor."
680	6659	3	3	"The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" directly influencing his emotional state. The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey, creating a rollercoaster of feelings. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town with its silent, empty buildings, so he was cautious and wary of his surroundings. Next, he came across a fork in the road with no clear signage, which was troubling to him as it represented a critical choice. Then he passed a slithering snake and had the obstacles of the steep, challenging hills which made him become determined to push through the difficulty. Finally, his determination changed to profound relief when he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, a sight that promised respite. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey, proving that the path itself is as much an internal experience as an external one."
681	6660	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, “After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing more than crumbling buildings and silence. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn’t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight. “One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn’t hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.” This was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water, which was undrinkable. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die from the heat and dehydration. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died, his relief tempered by the harsh journey.
682	6661	3	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the severe conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it is mocking his slow, painful progress. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died, a clear sign of his despair. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do profoundly affect the cyclist, dictating his physical state and his morale.
683	6662	3	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp,” greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left “wide rings of dried sweat” on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke at any moment. Also, the fact that the only water around felt “somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid” prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a dangerous “dehydrated state.” Finally, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival, providing a crucial respite from the oppressive environment.
684	6663	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn’t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble and would have taken a safer, more populated route. Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated and sapped his energy. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water, but his stubbornness pushed him forward. Plus the intense heat made him real hot and thirsty, weakening his resolve with every mile. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own, a hard lesson learned from this perilous journey through the desert.
685	6664	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist. The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates immediate doubt about the accuracy of the information. Also in the story it says “Tumbleweeds cross my path” this makes the cyclists feel lost and emphasizes the desolate nature of the landscape. Finally it say the “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired, highlighting his dwindling resources. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists, shaping his entire experience and challenging his endurance.
686	6665	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California, specifically through the arid high deserts. This affects him because he is sweating profusely and he is running out of water, a situation that is exacerbated by the relentless sun, and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use a lot more energy and strength to get up the steep inclines, which further drains his limited resources. That’s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”
687	6666	3	3	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the “high deserts of California in June.” This description usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place with cracked earth and sparse vegetation. The cyclist had trouble finding the water he desperately needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the harsh conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over “one long, crippling hill” that seemed to go on forever. From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if you’re already thirsty and fatigued. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride.
688	6667	3	3	Snake, heat, hills—all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamondback rattlesnake, a dangerous creature native to the area. He was going through the desert so it was like one hundred degrees, an oppressive and suffocating heat. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills that tested his physical limits. He had a ridiculous setting to have to bike with, one that presented constant and severe challenges. I would never be able to do what he did under such demanding circumstances.
689	6668	3	3	The cyclist had a lot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water, which became a source of great anxiety. This caused him to become dehydrated, leading to dizziness and a deep, persistent thirst. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid, leaving him completely isolated and self-reliant. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous, demanding every ounce of his endurance to complete the journey.
690	6669	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and exhausting. You get this picture from the author when the bike rider is describing his surroundings in vivid detail. The bike rider describes his location as the high deserts of California in June, being hot and musky, with rough terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally, conveying his struggle. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bike rider really is to push through the adversity. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bike rider emotionally and physically, making the reader feel the intensity of the journey.
691	6670	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the people around the area of @LOCATION1. Taking advice from older people in an open landed place can affect the cyclist, as their local knowledge might offer helpful guidance or, conversely, lead the rider astray depending on the accuracy of the information shared. This interaction demonstrates how the human element within a landscape directly influences the journey's progression and outcome, shaping the cyclist's experience through shared wisdom or potential misdirection.
692	6671	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” By Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth his ride was fast, allowing for efficient travel, but when it was the hills it took him longer to get to the next town, significantly increasing the physical effort and time required. This direct correlation between the terrain's difficulty and the cyclist's progress clearly illustrates the fundamental impact of the physical environment on his journey, defining the rhythm and challenge of his travel.
693	6672	3	3	Various features of the setting affect the journey and mood of the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the desert. He is “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, and this is making him really thirsty. “[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly” because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopeless because there is no building or establishments anywhere in sight; therefore, there is no water and there isn’t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him about a shortcut, and he listened. This threw everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. This lead him to success in finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conclusion, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways, from the despair of the arid landscape to the hope provided by unexpected aid.
694	6673	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark and rainy, there aren’t going to be many people running outside, which creates an isolated and potentially hazardous environment for travel. If it is snowing, the birds are not going to be swimming in the water, indicating a shift in the natural world that parallels the challenges faced by the cyclist in such harsh and unforgiving weather conditions. These environmental elements directly influence both the cyclist's visibility and the overall difficulty of the journey through the altered landscape.
695	6674	3	3	That explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is because some people don’t care about these features, failing to appreciate their impact. Everybody is working for a good feature, striving to improve their surroundings, but others they @CAPS1 still from people who work hard every day to have new features, undermining these collective efforts. This dynamic shows that the value and effect of a setting's features are not just inherent but are also shaped by the actions and attitudes of the people within it, ultimately influencing the cyclist's experience in a community context.
696	6675	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting profoundly affects the cyclist by instilling a deep sense of doubt. The cyclist becomes doubtful that he will ever make it to Yosemite National Park, a feeling that is compounded by the harsh and unforgiving landscape. His despair is captured in the thought, ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction."" This internal monologue clearly illustrates his dwindling hope. Ultimately, the cyclist's journey is defined by this pessimism, as he concludes that they will not succeed in reaching their destination, defeated by the environment around him."
697	6676	3	3	"In the passage, the specific features of the setting continually affect the cyclist's state of mind, as every new landmark he encounters triggers a different thought about his chances of survival. First, when the cyclist sees the mule, he finds the sight troubling, which signals his growing anxiety over the absence of any towns and begins to seed doubt about the old men's advice. Furthermore, when he arrives at the deserted juice factory, the sight gives him no hope, leading him to put pebbles in his mouth and resign himself to his fate with the thought, ""It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" This moment shows how the broken-down factory directly reinforces his despair, convincing him that he will perish in that desolate place."
698	6677	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a major impact on the character's physical state and morale. The cyclist was attempting to reach Yosemite National Park, but the journey was fraught with difficulty, primarily because the lack of civilization meant he was unable to refill his water bottles, leading to intense thirst. Additionally, the challenging terrain of many hills combined with the summer heat impacted him greatly, causing him to become exhausted more easily and unable to pedal as fast. The description, “A tar like substance oozed out… Wouldn’t cool down,” illustrates his desperate thirst and his inability to find relief. Similarly, passing the abandoned grape juice factory must have been a form of torture, taunting him with what he could not have. Had he not taken the advice of the old men initially, his ride would have been much shorter and far less exhausting, demonstrating how profoundly the setting affected the cyclist throughout this essay.
699	6678	3	3	The cyclist begins his journey with what seems a fine idea and from a promising starting point. However, the conditions quickly deteriorate, becoming hot, dreadful, and unbearably sticky. The constant, oppressive heat without any relieving breeze wore down the character's resolve. He began to see mirages, or so he believed, and his thoughts turned morbid, as he actually contemplated that he might die. His pessimistic nature is revealed in his declaration: “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat was clearly severe enough to affect his reasoning, making him feel as if he was slowly losing his sanity. Despite the painful experience, the intense heat ultimately served as a brilliant, if harsh, way to learn a lesson in cycling, all stemming from the old men who had offered their unhelpful directions.
700	6679	3	3	As he began his journey, the cyclist had full confidence in the directions given to him by the old men. This confidence began to wane after he reached the first supposed town and found no water, forcing him to ride on. Upon discovering a ramshackle shed, he became genuinely troubled, as he had been regularly consuming from his water bottles while traveling through the desert of California in June and was now running dangerously low. His hope briefly surged when he saw a building in the distance over the hills, and he maneuvered his way down, only to find it long deserted, a discovery that pushed him close to despair. He was desperate for water and knew he needed it soon to survive. Finally, his perseverance led him to a place called Wilber’s Fish Camp, where he at last quenched his thirst and felt profound relief. From that point on, he wised up, resolving to take no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about the realities of cycling.
701	6680	3	3	The features of the setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in the story in many ways. The first of which would definitely be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried, isolated in a vast and empty landscape. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is out in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned and scared for the main character, emphasizing his physical distress. The final key element was the distance he had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the oppressive heat, could be deadly. The setting’s harsh elements, from the isolation to the climate, greatly effect the cyclist in this story, shaping his difficult and perilous journey.
702	6681	3	3	The cyclist of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates by saying the water there was incredibly hot. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished and leaving his bottles empty. It also sapped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride and making every pedal stroke a struggle. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhere to replenish his water supply, increasing his sense of desperation. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough pedaling, sapping even more energy from his tired body. Ultimately, the heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful and grueling ride for the cyclist of this story.
703	6682	3	3	"The lone biker in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him to search desperately for a water source. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” In this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. The only water that the biker is able to find is not consumable, described as having ""the flavor of battery acid."" The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally regained the strength to continue on his journey, highlighting how the setting provided both the crisis and its resolution."
704	6683	3	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious—all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isn't anywhere near a town that could help him, surrounded only by parched land. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time under a relentless sun. Secondly, he is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water, his body craving hydration. He went forty miles before he reached the first town to stop at, a long and arduous stretch. He also is on a bike, so that doesn’t leave him much room to carry water along, limiting his resources. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55, yet he hasn't exceeded 12 mph, making progress feel slow and laborious. All together, the cyclist's trip seems to be an adventure that takes a lot of heart and endurance to complete.
705	6684	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn’t ready for where he was going. For example, the text states, “No better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the cosiness of their porches since Carter was in office.” So a young guy took bad advice from older guys about how to get to a pack; back in their day it probably was a shortcut, but the landscape has since changed. This misleading guidance led him into a remote and challenging environment for which he was unprepared. The setting, therefore, directly impacts his journey by presenting unexpected difficulties based on outdated information, concluding that one must be wary of advice that does not account for the current realities of a place.
706	6685	3	3	The setting profoundly affected the cyclist because it was an exceptionally hot day and he had exhausted his water supply. Furthermore, there were no towns along his route that had accessible, good water in them, which prolonged his suffering until he eventually arrived at the fishing competition. Due to his critical lack of water, he became severely dehydrated and felt really weak. The quote, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” clearly shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and was rapidly losing his energy, pushing his physical limits to find relief.
707	6686	3	3	Different settings can significantly effect how well your bicycle ride goes, shaping the entire experience. If it is intensely hot and the route has lots of steep hills, it makes the journey physically hard and demanding. Conversely, if you have no challenging hills and it is simply a sunny, breezy day, it makes for a very nice and pleasant ride. In the essay, the biker was in a difficult situation as he had no water left but was fortunately going down a hill. The act of going down the hill part was probably easy and provided a momentary respite, but the fact that he had no water left was decidedly not a good thing for his overall condition.
708	6687	3	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a difficult mental state because the oppressive sun was constantly on his mind, a result of him pedaling hard on a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water remaining, and him biking directly under a beating sun wasn’t exactly helping his situation. He had to endure what felt like disastrous events, such as pedaling up steep slopes faster than his normal speed, encountering a snake blocking the path, and old men telling him to take a different route to avoid being infected. The fact that his water supply was critically low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However, his determination remained strong as he continued on pedaling through the adversity, and he eventually found himself in another town, but this time it was a place with people, fish, and most importantly, water.
709	6688	3	3	From the narrative, the setting elements that affected the cyclist are possible physical conditions such as the extreme weather and the surrounding environment. This includes formidable features like steep hills and inaccessible streams, or even the types of animals present and the concern over if they are poisonous or not. These factors are not merely background details; the setting has and can directly change the decision a cyclist makes, forcing adjustments to their route and pace for safety and survival.
710	6689	3	3	The various features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, both physically and mentally. One primary way is that the relentless hot sun beating down makes the cyclist dangerously dehydrated, and since there are no readily available water sources around, the cyclist is not getting any hydration to recover. Additionally, the rough and uneven terrain, with its constant challenges, makes the cyclist increasingly tired, sapping his strength over the long and arduous journey.
711	6690	3	3	Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride. Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite. The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn, their empty windows and silent streets a testament to his isolation. The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite, forcing him to navigate the uneven, crumbling pavement. The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''. He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration, its sudden appearance on the hot asphalt heightening his sense of danger. All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite, each one presenting a unique challenge that tested his resolve.
712	6691	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if itís raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured, potentially leading to a fall from the bicycle. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if itís very hot outside you wouldnít see the cyclist in winter clothes, as heavy clothing would cause overheating. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldnít be able to finish any race, as discomfort from the environment directly impacts concentration and physical performance. Ultimately, the weather conditions are a fundamental factor that can determine the success or failure of a ride.
713	6692	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he canít go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop heís relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink, finally quenching his thirst after a long ride. He can also buy the worms to eat, providing him with a source of energy. The cyclist didnít really know where he was going because there wasnít a car, building, or structure in sight, leaving him completely disoriented in the vast landscape. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first ìtownî as he calls it in the essay, a place that offers a brief respite. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and heís only 12 he knows that heís not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park, realizing the true scale of his misadventure.
714	6693	3	3	"The features of the setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men whoís directions were out of date, leading him through a landscape that was unfamiliar and more desolate than expected. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, îFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,î which demanded greater physical effort and slowed his progress significantly. A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist, exacerbating his fatigue and dehydration. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways, each element of the environment contributing to his arduous journey."
715	6694	3	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, heís looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses, which shatter his expectations and deepen his sense of solitude. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be, seeing civilization in ruins when you are in need. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, heís becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, a cruel irony that highlighted his desperate need for a drink. Right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that thereís no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved, a final setting that provides the relief and assistance he had been searching for.
716	6695	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist profoundly when the people from Lodi deliberately gave him incorrect directions, leading him astray into a harsh and unforgiving landscape. The environment was extremely dry, offering no water or any form of sustenance until the next stop at the bait store. He was determined to reach this next destination, refusing to give up on his own resolve. However, when another individual approached and offered him directions, the cyclist was wary, having been misled once before. He resolved not to be fooled a second time, hardening his resolve to navigate the difficult terrain solely through his own perseverance and will to survive.
717	6696	3	3	"It cannot be known as ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not-so-friendly animals significantly adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn into a semi-brutal experience. He described getting down on his hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all his strength. An alike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. This quote shows how the poor conditions of his potential water supply led directly to his dehydration. Another feature, a sign reading ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,"" illustrates how the difficult riding conditions were making it harder for the cyclist to maintain any speed. Furthermore, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed his path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. This quote shows some of the active dangers the cyclist encountered. If these harsh environmental features did not appear, then perhaps the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, the journey becomes more of a disaster."
718	6697	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his arduous journey. It was so intensely hot where he was riding that he kept drinking his water without realizing it, only to discover he had just a couple of sips remaining. The demanding terrain also contributed to his thirst, because the more he had to labor up and down the steep hills, the more water he would consume. The psychological impact of the vast, empty landscape was significant; the fact that he did not see any town except for one ghost town for many miles deeply affected him, as he began to doubt he would make it to the next viable settlement. Ultimately, the setting played a major role for the cyclist because it affected him physically and mentally to such a great extent, defining the very nature of his struggle.
719	6698	3	3	Setting plays a big role in this story, fundamentally driving the narrative. Without the cyclist being in the desert during the hot summer, there would not be a central conflict. There would be no importance in saving his precious water supply to prevent dehydration. The long, flat roads act as a powerful symbol that the journey still has a far way to go, creating a sense of endless effort. However, as these straight roads eventually turn into challenging hills, it shows that there is a change occurring in the journey, suggesting that perseverance through difficulty might lead to something better about to happen for the determined traveler.
720	6699	3	3	"The setting is used to a great extent in the short story to shape the cyclist's experience. The cyclist had been going for a very long time when he came to the first promised town, only to find there was no water available. At this point, you can tell that he has lost all confidence in the ""old timers'"" directions. This is emphasized by the quote describing a ""tar-like substance oozed out"" from a pump. This shows how after many miles of pedaling, when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point, his one chance for water had been depleted. The next time the setting's effect is keenly felt is when he comes upon a building that was completely rusted out and abandoned. He said, ""I hung my head,"" and this action shows how he had almost completely lost all hope, becoming sure that he was not going to survive the ordeal."
721	6700	3	3	The cyclist is affected by a couple different things, primarily stemming from the challenging environment. First, he is given directions that are out of date, leading him astray, and then he has to deal with the oppressive heat of the early summer California weather. If that wasn’t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly given the strenuous nature of his journey. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big, intimidating snake and coming across a factory that used to make juice, which was now run down and completely empty, offering no respite. After all of these obstacles test his resolve, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to a fishing store, where he finally gets the water he so desperately needs, allowing him to continue his trek.
722	6701	3	3	During the cyclist’s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations, each shaped by his surroundings. Each experience is in response to the specific setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park, full of optimism. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town, a place of eerie silence and abandonment. This sight doesn’t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects of isolation and weariness. He decides to continue on his trek, reaching the next ghost town, and at this time he is becoming dehydrated due to his lack of water supply, his initial confidence beginning to wane. He decides to keep pursuing his goal and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town, clinging to this hope. In order to get to the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some difficult changes in terrain that challenge his endurance. Eventually, after reaching a source of running water, he is overjoyed with happiness and profound relief. As evident in the provided text, this man was affected by each feature of the setting, which directly shaped his emotional state. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence, transforming it from assured to tested and ultimately renewed.
723	6702	3	3	The setting affects the rider in very direct and physical ways because if it’s hot you get thirsty and you have no water, creating a cycle of discomfort and danger. This kind of question is hard to answer in a complex way because the relationship is so fundamental; the environment imposes immediate needs, and the lack of resources to meet those needs defines the struggle. The harsh conditions of the landscape directly dictate the challenges faced by the individual moving through it.
724	6703	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and physically difficult at every turn. For example, in the reading it states that a ridiculously large, poisonous diamondback snake blocked the majority of the pavement, presenting a direct threat. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance and proceed with extreme caution to ease past them without incident. The terrain also changed into short, rolling hills, making the pedaling even more difficult and sapping the rider's energy. These environmental obstacles combined to create a taxing and hazardous trip.
725	6704	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, which is dehydration, a constant and pressing concern. There are several features that cause the author to dehydrate rapidly. First off, he is riding through a desert located in California, an inherently arid region. This means that there is intense heat from the sun constantly beating down on him, accelerating fluid loss. Also the change from a “flat road” to “short, rolling hills” also affected him, contributing to his getting dehydrated. This change in topography caused him to use more energy to climb up the hills, which means he used more water because he got thirstier faster from the exertion. This is how the specific features in the setting affected the author of the essay, creating a central conflict of man against a demanding environment.
726	6705	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills, which drained his remaining energy. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake, his focus wavering. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite, with no hope of outside assistance. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist and his difficult journey.
727	6706	3	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront nature directly. When he began his trip with advice from “old coggers,” he “rode out with strong legs and a smile,” full of optimism. As he came to the first town, he describes it as a “ghost town” having no water and no human contact for some time, a desolate and foreboding place. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on, pushing further into the wilderness. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps that offered no relief, snakes, and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and caused his dehydration to further, sapping his physical and mental strength. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation, transforming his trip into a grueling trial of survival.
728	6707	3	3	The harsh features of the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June,” some significant problems arise. The intense heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist, causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply, leaving him vulnerable. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax, which compounds his difficulties. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through the ghost terrain and even a snake, each posing a new challenge. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey, casting a shadow of doubt over his entire expedition.
729	6708	3	3	Cycling is a very good sport for people who do cycling are in shape and possess excellent cardiovascular health. Also they have strong calve muscles developed from the constant pedaling motion required by the activity. I think its also dangerous as well, exposing participants to risks from traffic, road conditions, and potential falls. Despite the dangers, it remains a popular and rewarding form of exercise and transportation for many enthusiasts around the world.
730	6709	3	3	In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply, creating a dire situation. At one point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration, his spirit broken by the relentless conditions. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat, with no end in sight. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling, a testament to the vivid description. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat,” a stark illustration of his extreme thirst. The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way, becoming his primary adversary. He was exhausted and could not go on without water, highlighting the critical challenge posed by the environment.
731	6710	3	3	The cyclist found the journey to be incredibly hard, both physically and mentally. He was also deeply upset that the old timers at the general store had given him such bad directions, leading him into this difficult situation. Their misleading advice, perhaps offered with a casual indifference, had set him on a path of unnecessary hardship, compounding the physical strain with a sense of betrayal and frustration as he pedaled onward.
732	6711	3	3	The harsh setting affects the cyclist in many ways, creating a relentless series of challenges. First, he couldn’t get water from anywhere because he was in a desert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty, abandoned camps offering no respite. Second, the landscape itself was an adversary; there were short rolling hills that sapped his momentum and rough, cracked roads which made it hard to ride on. Tumbleweeds rolled into his path and the threat of large, poisonous snakes added a layer of constant danger. The oppressive, unrelenting heat made it hard to keep riding, draining his energy with every turn of the pedal. And crucially, there were no buildings or structures of people around to give him a lift or a much-needed share of water. That is how the unforgiving setting profoundly affects the cyclist, isolating him in a fight for his well-being.
733	6712	3	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men who seem to take amusement from his naivete. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration, a direct consequence of their poor guidance. The setting is an excellent way to portray his escalating feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy, and the air is cool and breezy, creating a false sense of security. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder, mirroring his internal struggle. He sees only empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun blazing down from a cloudless sky. He begins to despair even more as the environment offers no solace. After a while, when he thinks he can go no more, he sees a derelict store that once held gallons of grape juice, now just a hollow shell. He laughs at the bitter irony of the empty promise. Ultimately, the setting does a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness and the cruel lesson learned on the road.
734	6713	3	3	In this passage the cyclist was profoundly affected by the setting because if it had been anywhere else he would not have suffered or learned anything at all. It was because the setting had both a severe lack of civilisation and the water that he desperately needed that caused him to almost faint from thirst. This is a clear example of the setting affecting the cyclist, as shown when he thinks, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This shows that had the entire setting been a paradise, he would never have been pushed to his limits and consequently never learned anything about his own resilience and the perils of the desert.
735	6714	3	3	The specific features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer greatly yet also continue being determined to press forward. The author of the essay used phrases such as “the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme, blistering heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and the onset of heat exhaustion. The essay also describes “short rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds” blocking his path, and a “long, crippling hill” to illustrate the difficult and varied terrain the cyclist faced, which caused him to grow increasingly tired and slow his progress significantly. Finally, the cyclist is faced with a “ridiculously large snake” and other stubborn plants and weeds which get in his way, forcing him to slow down and navigate these obstacles with caution, adding to his overall ordeal.
736	6715	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates, the air becomes parched and the ground cracks, intensifying the physical strain. The relentless sun beats down, causing dehydration and fatigue to set in quickly. This harsh environment directly challenges the cyclist's endurance and limits the distance that can be comfortably covered. Ultimately, the arid setting is a dominant force that shapes the entire cycling experience, making it a grueling test of will.
737	6716	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead"" plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesnít allow it, rapidly depleting her reserves. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road, which jostles her bike and strains her muscles. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill, her legs burning with the effort. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 seeís it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesnít receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds, a thought that amplifies her desperation. ìThen, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.î @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her, marking the triumphant end of her arduous journey."
738	6717	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, ì I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way, creating a sense of isolation and danger. The barren landscape, devoid of other people or signs of help, deepens his despair. This answers the question because it shows how the setting, with its desolate and threatening elements, directly leads to his feeling of hopelessness."
739	6718	3	3	The story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see, a vast and empty expanse. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.î is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience, highlighting the extreme physical toll. The unending road and oppressive sun created a suffocating atmosphere of struggle. This whole trip sounds suffering, a true testament to human endurance against a merciless environment.
740	6719	3	3	The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding in the hot sun he became very thirsty because whe only had a few drops of water left, and the shimmering heat offered no respite. The barren landscape provided no shade or sources of relief, intensifying his need for water. This physical hardship directly influenced his morale and energy levels, slowing his progress significantly. That is how the setting, through its climate and lack of resources, can profoundly affect the cyclist's condition and journey.
741	6720	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly, creating a harsh and oppressive environment. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, with the dry, bitter land inducing a profound sense of longing. This overwhelming longing for relief and a cool respite defines his entire arduous journey through the unforgiving landscape.
742	6721	3	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite, imposing severe physical demands. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, ì followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. î The crucial thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said ì  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. î This constant battle against the elements defined his experience. In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.
743	6722	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî The man was riding a bike through rough lands, which defined the very nature of his undertaking. His adventure wouldnít of been an adventure if he was just riding his bike an flat smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky and many hills is what made his bike ride what it was, transforming a simple trip into a true test of endurance and will against the challenging terrain.
744	6723	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is the old timers advice of how to get some were, which proved to be completely unreliable. Than the town they told go to was a ghost town, abandoned and desolate. After he keep going the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty and he pumped it he gaid tar came out, offering no relief. Than as he made his way in the dessert there way a snake came in the road he go around it, another hazard in the bleak landscape. So never take advice from old timers, as their knowledge of the land can be dangerously outdated.
745	6724	3	3	In the story, ìDo not exceed posted speed limit,î the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills, which created a relentless physical challenge. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip, highlighting the extreme nature of his journey. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish, ultimately triumphing over the difficult environment.
746	6725	3	3	The rider's condition was rough, as the terrain shifted from flat land to steep rolling hills. This would be hard for someone who is dehydrating, sapping their remaining energy. There was a snake sunning itself in his path, so he carefully went around it. This would be dangerous; he could blackout from a severe lack of water and then get bit by the snake, a perilous situation with no help in sight. The cumulative challenges of the landscape and its inhabitants created a genuinely hazardous journey.
747	6726	3	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings, which mirror his internal state. First, he described a beating sun and tall pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things, full of life and motion. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent, suggesting a powerful, forward momentum. The setting is active just like the cyclist, reflecting his own determined progress. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad sounding corral. When these old, forsaken things are mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair, his spirits dampened by the decay. And to cap that off, he drinks water that tastes like “battery acid.” Battery acid eats at skin just like the harsh setting is eating at the cyclist, corroding his resolve and physical well-being.
748	6727	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclist's emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways, guiding his journey. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce, showing how the unforgiving terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved, showing a positive influence, but the pump oozes a shiny substance he refers to as tasting like “battery acid,” changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his mouth show his desperation and willingness to try anything to survive, showing a new positive outlook on the desert until a pebble “lodges itself in his throat,” making yet another negative influence. All of these features lead him on his way to “Gary and Will’s fish camp” and provided an extra, hard-won boost on his journey through the desert, proving the landscape's dual role as both antagonist and catalyst.
749	6728	3	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is intensely hot and there is no refuge to be found. An example from the text is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,"" emphasizing his profound isolation. There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water-depleting 12 mph, a pace that felt cruelly slow and inefficient. Sometimes life can feel so cruel, a sentiment that captures what affected the cyclist the most: the heart of the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most of all, the complete absence of clear directions in a vast, empty landscape."
750	6729	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of where they were, which felt like the middle of nowhere, and every person they asked for directions seemed to be having senior moments. They kept getting the wrong directions to the nearest town, leading them further astray. The old guy told him it was just a few miles down the road, but when he went many more miles to the next town, he said to himself he would never take directions from a guy that has all timers and hasn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. This frustrating experience with the locals, a direct product of the remote setting, ultimately compounded his difficulties and extended his arduous journey.
751	6730	3	3	When the cyclist is in the serenity of an early sunset evening, he enjoyed his peaceful ride just hoping he could cut his travel time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the suggested road, he saw a ghost town, which is never a good sign for a traveler. Next, he came to a fork and the town he chose to enter had no available water, deepening his concern. On the way to the new town, he came to a bumpy road and, going at a steady pace, he was completely out of water, but finally, after his sheer determination, he made it to a place that was very nice and welcoming. So as you can tell, the various features of the scenic road affected him greatly throughout his difficult journey.
752	6731	3	3	I think that the harsh setting made him find more courage inside himself to save his remaining water and press on, deciding to go to the next town without any water at all. This difficult choice was forced upon him by the desolate environment, testing his resolve and inner strength as he faced the uncertainty of the path ahead. Ultimately, this experience proved how the landscape could shape a person's decisions and fortitude.
753	6732	3	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story “do not exceed posted speed limit.” It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California wore down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The intense heat and the total lack of water supply made the boy dangerously dehydrated. It says in the essay “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen.” This quote explains just how simply exhausted he had become due to the many miles of cycling, the beating down sun, and the complete absence of water due to the lack of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhaustion because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions to avoid such a perilous situation again.
754	6733	3	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that he loves, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confident in the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt their judgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted. Though at first he laughs it off, he later realizes just how much trouble he is in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump, just what he needs, yet the water is something close to toxic and undrinkable. A road sign reminds him not to go too fast, though he might die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture of a happy boy guzzling grape juice as he himself dehydrates. All these features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point of his endurance."
755	6734	3	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because everything that was happening years ago is happening now in today's world, meaning wars, rights, and etcetera; today's feature is the same as the past. Everything is repeating itself, and the cyclist's struggle against the harsh landscape mirrors these larger, recurring conflicts of human experience. This cyclical nature of challenges shows how settings can reflect timeless human trials.
756	6735	3	3	When riding a bike it may not seem too hard at first glance. For a dedicated cyclist, however, every single thing becomes more serious, driven by the sheer determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay, he clearly under estimates the older, more experienced cyclist. When really they are the people with far more knowledge and hard-earned wisdom. Some of the things that can be incredibly hard for a cyclist are the rough, unforgiving roads. Not only is there a constant chance to be killed from severe dehydration or from being ran over by a passing vehicle. Riding a bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather, the sun beating down relentlessly. Drinking sports drink after sports drink and never having any fresh, cool water becomes a torment. No water and it being so hot could easily cause a dangerous heat stroke. As the road conditions get worse, the chances of mishap get higher with obstacles like tumble weeds and snakes in the way, yet he was determined to win at all costs. After all was said and he finally faced the horror that nature brought him, he knew he was profoundly wrong for underestimating them and their superior intelligants.
757	6736	3	3	The distinct features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different and challenging ways. The fact that he was riding through the vast California desert meant the intense, dry heat affected him severely because he had very limited water and was constantly using up his energy just riding the bike across the immense landscape. The so-called “towns” he came across, which were little more than sparse collections of buildings, also made a significant impact on him because of the discouraging fact that he couldn’t get more water or find a proper place to rest and recover. His frustration is clear when he states, “I was doing a water depleating ride and sometimes life can feel so cruel”. This poignant statement effectively shows how the combination of the hilly terrain, the relentless dehydration, and the oppressive heat are critically affecting the cyclist's physical state and his morale.
758	6737	3	3	Two of the biggest setting elements in this story is the expansive desert and the endless rolling hills. This specific environment would drastically effect the rider primarily becaus of the extreme dehydration that he would inevitably experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot, losing precious bodily fluids, and the steep hills would make it exceptionally tough on your body because you must put extrat strain and effort to get up them, further exhausting yourself. So all together, with the heat sapping his strength and the hills demanding extra power, this would be an exceptionally hard and grueling bike ride that tests his limits.
759	6738	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences severe and dangerous dehydration on his long, arduous journey. The cyclist takes directions from older local guys who look like they haven’t left their porches in ages, trusting their local knowledge. He takes their advice and he then sukkers greatly in the long run because he cannot find any source of water and it is an exceptionally hot afternoon with the sun at its peak. He hikes up steep hills in the heating sun and genuinely begins to fear suffering a debilitating heat stroke. There was no comforting sight of civilization, not a building or a car in any direction, leaving him completely isolated in the harsh environment.
760	6739	3	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way, presenting both challenges and small reprieves. In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a surprisingly good way. In the story, it continues to talk about the critical lack of water and its consequences. The narrator observes, “When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery acid,” which shows that the intense heat had made his remaining water warm and unpalatable, so it did not cool him down or provide proper relief. But a good way it affect them is through the discovery of pebbles. He recalls, ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate."" This shows that even though he has no water, the simple pebbles can momentarily make him feel less thirsty by stimulating saliva. This is precisely how the setting affects the cyclist, in both a good way and a bad way, shaping his struggle for survival."
761	6740	3	3	In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclist's journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, a severe lack of water, the threat of rattle snakes, and a deep fear of dying. However, he shows great determination and emotional control throughout these trials. An example of his determination is when he thinks, “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that.” This shows his mental resolve, that he feels he can push himself to go on such a long and demanding journey despite his exhaustion. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding a building to be completely abandoned, and all useful things like juice gone, anyone else would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist; he controlled his anger and again showed his steely determination to persevere. And it paid off in the end, for he eventually found his water and survived the ordeal. This story is a great narrative that powerfully shows the vital importance of determination and self-control in overcoming extreme adversity.
762	6741	3	3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed that the “sun was beginning to beat down.” He was calm and was looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” dreaming of the beautiful destination. Never once did he imagine what he had truly gotten himself into. As he began to approach the vast desert, he noticed he was running dangerously low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combined with the scorching, relentless heat of the desert began to take a severe effect on his body. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put dry pebbles into his mouth, a trick he had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across, but dehydration took its toll, and he felt hallucinations beginning to cloud his vision and mind. He was beginning to lose all hope as the heat and the hills and the profound lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine, but the harsh setting created a perfect storm of suffering.
763	6742	3	3	In the cyclist's story, the setting took a huge role on how the story turned out. The lack of water had a lot of severe effects on the cyclist's physical and mental state. The setting of the story took place in the high deserts of California in June, a time of extreme heat. As soon as you read that, you now know something is terribly wrong for a lone bicyclist. In the story he says, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” This is going to affect him profoundly because he is riding through the desert on a bike, which causes him to become rapidly dehydrated. He notes, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He is beginning to lose his mind because he has no water, a direct result of the unforgiving setting. Everything about the setting causes the cyclist some major problems. The intense heat, the isolated setting, and the critical lack of water almost costs him his life, showing how environment dictates survival.
764	6743	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a lot of ways, primarily through its physical demands and climate. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a vast desert in June, under a blistering sun. If he was riding in @LOCATION1, a cooler and more forgiving environment, it wouldn't be so painfully hot and draining. Also, the rolling hills probably didn't help his progress and sapped his remaining strength. If the path was mostly down hill, he would have been fine and made better time. However, riding a bike up a steep hill when you are already tired and dehydrated is near impossible, and this geographic feature became a significant obstacle in his journey.
765	6744	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to @ORGANIZATION2 greatly affected the cyclist, presenting one hardship after another. On the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the entire road, which greatly frightened the biker and added a psychological fear to his physical struggles. Also, the roads were long and very bumpy and windy, making the ride physically jarring and slow. The road wasn’t the most comfortable to be riding on, wearing down his endurance. There was nothing in sight for the cyclist to see, no signs of life or civilization to boost his morale. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope left to sustain him. The author states, “… gaining elevation while loosing hope,” a powerful description of his declining spirit. Last, the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out immensely. He had no water with him and with the oppressive weather he had no energy or hope left to help him through the difficult journey to Yosemite National Park, making the path itself the central antagonist of his tale.
766	6745	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist experienced a few life-threatening times during his adventure. The first feature was when he was in a desert with temperatures of over one hundred degrees, and his little bit of water tasted like battery acid, offering no refreshment. As he tried to keep going, he lost hope and thought he was going to die, his strength fading with every pedal. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negatively about things and didn't think he would make it, but then he found a final reserve of will and got the agility to move on. In this story, the setting affects the characters dramatically, shaping their mental and physical state at every turn.
767	6746	3	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated because he thought he was going the right way when he really was going out of his intended path, a miscalculation that wasted precious energy. The vast, monotonous landscape offered no landmarks, deepening his confusion and thirst as he pedaled onward. This disorienting environment directly contributed to his growing desperation and physical strain. Ultimately, the setting's deceptive nature is a primary source of his struggle.
768	6747	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply, a dangerous combination. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at any minute from heat exhaustion, pushing him to his absolute limit. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist, as they create the central conflict and danger.
769	6748	3	3	Certain features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. At first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little unsettled by it because the old “codgers” had told him it would be thriving. Halfway through his journey he stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.'' Water was running low and he still had a ways to go until he made it to the park, and he felt as if it would never end. All that he sees around him is hills of nothingness under the scorching sun with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist, only the empty, vast expanse. The ghost town and the lack of shade or salvation are the very features of the setting that make the cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from the older men, leaving him alone in a barren landscape.
770	6749	3	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot and drinking his water, so he would soon run out of water and dehydrate under the relentless sun. For example, in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left, and around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing and even death, highlighting his constant fear. Another example is the relief he had when he drank the water from the sink, a moment of pure salvation that contrasted sharply with his prior suffering. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist, proving the environment was his greatest adversary.
771	6750	3	3	This paragraph tells about how careful you should be on the roads, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance. This also talks about what you have to be aware of, such as other drivers, pedestrians, and changing road conditions. There are so many things that could happen unexpectedly, from sudden stops to obstacles appearing in your path. You have to take control when you are on the road, maintaining focus and anticipating potential hazards to ensure a safe journey for everyone.
772	6751	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, it states “This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war; it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This statement is talking about the desolate town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding with confidence in the beginning, but then the first town he arrives in looks abandoned and eerie, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel and know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to an unfamiliar place they can feel lost and less confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out, having ridden all that way only to find his progress impeded by a road that was not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore, the various features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie significantly affects the cyclist's morale and journey.
773	6752	3	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were a various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were the heat; it was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast, and make good decisions. Another would be that there was loose gravel on the road, and that makes it tough to maneuver a bicycle, forcing you to watch your speed carefully. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry under such tricky conditions. Also, there were lots of steep hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one at that. Adding to that, he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration, which again clouds judgment and can even lead to heat stroke or exhaustion. Another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere, so it’s not like he could just stop somewhere to rest; when he asks for a drink, there was nothing around for miles. These challenging things show how rough the road was made because these difficult conditions existed throughout his trip.
774	6753	3	3	The setting was very hot, dry, and was a desert landscape. This setting affected him because it was making him very dehydrated and overheated from the relentless sun. It was very hard for him to go any further through the harsh environment, but he knew he had to keep going to reach his destination. Also, the land was very barren and empty, with little life or relief from the monotony of the sand and rock stretching everything around him. Clearly, the severe desert setting profoundly effected the biker, testing his physical and mental limits.
775	6754	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back roads, isolated with no place to stop for water or supplies. If the cyclist would have followed the main path they originally intended on following, the ride probably would have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn’t have had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water so desperately. On a better route, they would have found services and shade, and they would have been fine, but the isolated back roads created a serious and hazardous situation for the journey.
776	6755	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to stay strong and be able to keep riding, demanding constant physical exertion. The abandoned building and there being no people could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find his destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town, a sight that crushed his remaining spirit. After all, he did say, ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to die Ö ì(Kurmaskie). The profound isolation of the landscape thus directly contributed to his sense of despair and physical struggle.
777	6756	3	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. ìÖ I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in JuneÖ.î (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert, with the sun beating down relentlessly. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was in the middle of no where with no one to help him, amplifying his vulnerability. The intense, unremitting heat of the June desert was therefore a primary antagonist in his journey, threatening his very survival. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.
778	6757	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said ìRough Road Aheadî he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirstier, creating a vicious cycle of exhaustion. Also, when he stopped at the old Welchís Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. ìIíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulateî. This desperate act highlights his extreme thirst. Lastly, ìGARY AND WILBERíS FISH CAMPî, could possibly have saved the cyclistís life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features, from the rough terrain to the lifesaving fish camp, severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.
779	6758	3	3	"In ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, the features of the setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, ìa reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, Californiaî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident, providing a positive start. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, ìThis sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), as the desolation saps his morale. Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, ìThen, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind meî (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has a direct and powerful effect on his emotional state, from optimism to despair and finally to relief."
780	6759	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they donít ride as much anymore and donít know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are. The terrain, perhaps once familiar, now presents unexpected challenges like steeper inclines or rougher pavement. This disconnect between memory and reality makes the journey more arduous than anticipated. Consequently, the setting's difficulty is magnified by the cyclist's own outdated assumptions, leading to a more strenuous and discouraging experience than if a better-suited route had been chosen.
781	6760	3	3	At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path, emphasizing the desolation of the landscape. Being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down relentlessly, and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point of utter exhaustion. The sign that said “Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to be intimidating, its stark warning a promise of further hardship. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast, making the caution seem almost mocking. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office, their world view frozen in time. yes like the writer said “the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.” The old men probably had close to no clue what they were talking about considering things have changed drastically since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating, a sudden and dangerous presence. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more lurking in the sparse brush. In essence I think the setting was a major part why the cyclist felt that way, its harshness shaping his entire experience.
782	6761	3	3	From what there is in this picture the cyclist is riding through a dry and arid area which could mean that it is very hot and the cyclist looks to be going down hill, though there looks to be a lot of sharp turns ahead. From the body position of the cyclist he seems to be trying at his best and hardest to make it to his destination, leaning forward with clear determination. All of this could be a big stress on the cyclist, he maybe sweating really hard and maybe tired from the constant effort. The wind @MONTH1 not be helping him at all, perhaps even pushing against him as he pedals. The combined challenges of the terrain and the climate create a formidable test of his endurance.
783	6762	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park with misplaced confidence. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss, a growing unease in the pit of his stomach. The first “town” the locals said he’d find is completely deserted, a ghost of a place. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist desperately needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has “the flavor of battery acid,” making it nearly undrinkable. With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his meager water to make it there, each sip a precious resource. Even then, things get worse as the environment intensifies its assault. As he is, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” the “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” sapping his strength. @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a “water-depleting @NUM3,” a climb that pushes him to his absolute limit. Eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, learning a hard lesson about knowing now to strike out on better days and with better directions.
784	6763	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot, this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate rapidly under the scorching sun. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change, the challenge increased. The road changed into rolling hills, one after another. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down repeatedly your body gets tired and muscles ache. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water, depleting her supply too quickly. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated, a dangerous situation. This whole situation implied the importance to stick to your original plan, as deviating from it led to unnecessary peril. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn’t have had to go through the hardships that the unforgiving setting presented.
785	6764	3	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entitled, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way, shaping his journey step by step. For example, in the text, when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a “ridiculously large snake” crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile, his focus entirely redirected. Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist, a beacon in the vast emptiness. This hope allowed the narrator to become more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building, pushing through the fatigue. Whether for better or worse, a few features of the setting arrive and affect the cyclist every step of his journey, each one leaving its mark on his physical and mental state.
786	6765	3	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist’s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape, providing a sense of ease and natural beauty. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst, as these dilapidated structures signal a lack of sustenance. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted, the harsh environment sapping his remaining strength. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he might not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let down for the cyclist’s mental state, representing another promise of relief that remains unfulfilled. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned through this profound experience of hardship and eventual relief.
787	6766	3	3	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was “going to drop from heat exsostion,” which shows the physical toll of the environment. He is riding through the desert in the summer, and the extreme conditions clearly wear him down. Furthermore, he took directions from three old “gentlemen” sitting on a porch, and their misleading advice directly impacts his journey, leading him astray and adding to his ordeal. This combination of natural and human elements from the setting profoundly shapes his difficult experience.
788	6767	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts, making his ride a struggle for survival. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds, presenting a constant physical challenge. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted, crushing his spirits. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost doom him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man’s short tent again, showing how the setting's inhabitants influenced his path. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout his arduous trip.
789	6768	3	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily, leading to severe dehydration. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top, demanding great physical exertion. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily, making the desert setting a genuinely dangerous place for anyone traveling through it without adequate preparation. These environmental factors combine to create a significant and potentially lethal challenge for any individual.
790	6769	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, but that soon changes as the landscape proves more demanding than anticipated. For example, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.” This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men soon changed that, leading him onto a more difficult path. The features of the setting, from the misleading local advice to the unforgiving terrain, affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” ultimately teaching him a hard-won lesson about preparation and reliance on outdated information.
791	6770	3	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhaustion. The intense heat of @MONTH1 causes the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal, a situation made critical by his severe lack of water. This dangerous combination means the cyclist might pass out or suffer a debilitating heat stroke. Furthermore, the challenging terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist much quicker than if he were still traveling on a flat road. His muscles will start to ache profoundly, and his body will desperately cry out for water and rest. The story would totally change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1, he would not have any chance of suffering a heatstroke. In such cooler conditions, there would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dangerously dehydrated. Ultimately, the setting is very important in every story and can fundamentally change everything for its characters.
792	6771	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention covering long, arduous distances. He has to ride up and down a series of small and large hills through what he mistakenly believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a critically limited water supply, and he keeps coming across desolate ghost towns, where the only available water is boiling brackish water that is entirely unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy was the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which was abandoned, of course. Adding salt to the wound was the fact that “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator, with his dwindling water supply, this taunting billboard was especially daunting and psychologically taxing to him on his difficult journey, highlighting the cruelty of his surroundings.
793	6772	3	3	The desert, the hills, the road condition, and the lack of water—all are ways in which the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This means it was exceptionally hot and arid. Second, the hills and road conditions were horrible and physically demanding. The cyclist reveals this when he describes how the “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” and again when he sees a road sign that read: “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” Lastly, he had mistakenly thought that he would have stops on the way to get more water from, so he drank all the water he wanted initially. He then figured out he needed to conserve it, but by then it was tragically too late. These examples clearly show that the cyclist's physical condition was made much harder than he had ever expected them to be due to the unforgiving setting.
794	6773	3	3	The features of the setting directly affect the cyclist and his safety. The winding nature of the road could affect his turns because he could turn too far one way, lose control, fall off his bike, and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is the tall grass on both sides of the narrow road. If he tires and tries to take a short-cut or simply veers into the grass, he could hit a hidden rock or a ditch, causing him to flip off his bike and sustain a serious injury. These potential hazards demonstrate how the physical features of the setting could negatively affect the cyclist's journey and well-being, proving that the environment is a key factor in his experience.
795	6774	3	3	The setting of where the cyclist found himself was a harsh California desert in the middle of a scorching June. He begins to think he's going to die towards the end of his ordeal, primarily because of the faulty directions he received from locals. His realization is captured in the thought, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This statement means one should never take directions from people who haven’t personally traveled to the place or verified the route for a very long time, as their information is likely outdated and dangerously unreliable, a lesson he learned through his dire predicament.
796	6775	3	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed, sending him down a desolate and dangerous path. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off from the relentless heat and exertion. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learned that just because they are old and look wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum, which can be dangerously outdated. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip, a hard-earned lesson about self-reliance and the perils of blind faith.
797	6776	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in “ghost towns”, there is no-one to ask directions from or to just talk to, amplifying the sense of isolation. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like “battery acid” and could most likely make someone sick, turning a potential source of relief into a new danger. Also, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals that pose a constant threat, forcing the cyclist to remain vigilant even in his exhausted state. These environmental hazards collectively shape a journey defined by hardship and survival.
798	6777	3	3	"There are many features in the story that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is desperate and says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips.."" it is say that there is hardly any water left, and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some, pushing through the physical agony. In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store, where his ordeal finally finds a point of respite. The scarcity of this basic necessity becomes the central conflict of his journey."
799	6778	3	3	In this analysis I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story “Rough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” The whole ordeal occurs in the “high deserts of california.” According to the text the cyclist had taken “out of date” direction from elderly people who thought they new the way, leading him astray. The cyclist encountered a snake, ghost town and shutdown factory, each presenting its own unique challenge. Most of the time the cyclist was going over harsh, unforgiving terrain that tested his limits and resolve at every turn, defining his arduous experience.
800	6779	3	3	The setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the “high desert of California in June”. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied, bearing down on him mercilessly. The terrain changing into “short rolling hills” didn’t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn’t have that hints to keep moving. He didn’t set a very goal he just went to the “next Horizon”. Shouldn’t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the “Rough Road Affect” sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble, each bump and crack sapping his dwindling energy and highlighting the brutal nature of his journey.
801	6780	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he came across a building that was abandoned years earlier; by the looks of it, it had been a Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. The cruel irony of seeing an advertisement for a refreshing drink while parched and desperate intensified his thirst and deepened his sense of deprivation. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was the speed limit sign. The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometime life can feel so cruel. This stark reminder of his slow progress compared to motorized travel highlighted his vulnerability and the immense effort required for his journey. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering, with every feature of the landscape seeming to conspire against his progress and morale.
802	6781	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclist is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. He followed their advice, but on that morning the promised town fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, with no signs of life or open stores. This effects the cyclist because he has eventually going to need more water and the abandoned settlement offers no respite, only disappointment. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challenging for the cyclist, demanding greater physical exertion. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless, as they represent failed hopes and a lack of support. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired from the constant struggle. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved, finding a momentary sanctuary from the harsh demands of the journey.
803	6782	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist. The environment establishes the tone and the challenges that define the narrative, directly influencing the protagonist's experience. As the setting presents its obstacles and character, it shapes the cyclist's journey, making his struggles and eventual outcome a direct result of these environmental features. Therefore, the setting's role is fundamental in driving the cyclist's story forward and defining the nature of his ordeal.
804	6783	3	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren’t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamond back – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to continue on my arduous way."" Each element of the desert setting, from the oppressive heat and lack of water to the dangerous wildlife and misleading directions, compounds the cyclist's physical struggle and mental fatigue, making his journey a relentless test of endurance against a hostile environment."
805	6784	3	3	The cyclist choose the worst time to ride his it was an “early summer evening” in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost, it was hot the best choice that he made. The intense heat of the setting sapped his energy and accelerated his dehydration, turning a difficult ride into a perilous one. A cyclist before do a trip he or she should be prepared for whether conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. This lack of preparation, combined with the unforgiving timing of his journey, meant that the setting itself became his greatest adversary, demonstrating how crucial environmental awareness is for any successful undertaking.
806	6785	3	3	The cyclist, having run into a diamond-headed snake, is out of water and is in the middle of nowhere. The thing I would do is find some rope or cord, perhaps from an old building or a sturdy tree branch, and hang myself for taking directions from old people that haven't left their porches since Carter was in office. Their knowledge of the local terrain was clearly decades out of date, leading to this desperate and isolated situation where every shadow seems to hold another threat. The profound regret for that single, foolish decision is the only thing left, a heavy weight in a barren landscape offering no solace or escape from the consequences of misplaced trust.
807	6786	3	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the “ghost town” early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps, which offered no relief, and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed that provided no shelter. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to, making the official decree feel like a cruel joke. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” Finally, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist’s relief was so immense that he, “had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them,” a testament to the profound impact a simple, functioning amenity had after miles of desolation.
808	6787	3	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map away, a decision that would haunt him. But thinking the old folks knew the route, he took their advice, trusting their local knowledge over his own planned path. What the biker should have done was look for someone else to ask and make sure the route would work, verifying the information before committing to it. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than was needed, a direct result of his impulsive action. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe, as a moment of patience can prevent a world of hardship and regret on a long, lonely road.
809	6788	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn’t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn’t really sure about. It was hot, he was running out of water, and he had no idea where he was; there were snakes and his water was running out. There were no signs to guide him, only the oppressive heat and the silent, watchful desert. He kept thinking that he would never take directions from old guys again and that he would stick to the map in the future, a lesson learned too late in a landscape that offered no second chances and no easy way out of the predicament he had created for himself.
810	6789	3	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine, trusting their confident assurances. When he gets to the first town he’s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon, clinging to a hope that the old men were right. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he’s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date, the pump itself being broken and useless. He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map, a wave of frustration and self-recrimination washing over him. When he gets to the fishing place he is grateful for the water in the sink and for the rest, and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map, having learned his lesson. Throughout the story the cyclist's needs change from feeling confident in his shortcut to feeling depressed in his isolation to feeling relieved at his salvation, a complete emotional journey dictated entirely by the misleading and unforgiving setting.
811	6790	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting profoundly affected the main character, the cyclist, during his pedal. For example, while the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive without water, he ultimately became dehydrated. The first town, with its tepid water, could not satisfy his standards for a refreshing drink. The old vehicles and the June factory were all run down and no longer in business, much like the desert itself, representing just old, barren, unusable land. While the cyclist did survive the pedal, the desert setting posed a great challenge for him, testing his endurance and preparedness to the limit."
812	6791	3	3	There are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist throughout his journey. One significant feature is the escalating heat, which will eventually have a severe effect on him. The line, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” shows that the intense heat might be starting to affect his vision and perception. Another critical feature is his location in the desert while running dangerously low on water. The line, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is rapidly depleting his supply. A further feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June, a detail confirmed by the story which states, “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is it June, but this adds to the oppressive heat because he is also in a desert environment. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated under these combined pressures. Those are some of the many features that significantly effect the cyclist and his arduous trip.
813	6792	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it creates a deserted atmosphere and helps set the overall mood of the essay. The mood of the essay is that of a dry summer day, the sort of “oh my gosh, it’s really hot,” type of feeling. The setting is a dry summer day in June, complete with a deserted town, tumbleweeds, and other desolate features that contribute to the hopeless feeling. Although he was ultimately secured and didn’t die, it seemed for a time like he would surely not make it, judging by the lack of water, the scorching hot sun, and the vast distance he had to cover while enduring these harsh conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him, creating a constant sense of peril and struggle against the elements.
814	6793	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the old guys he encountered had warned that the next town was only eighteen miles down the road, a distance that proved challenging in the harsh environment. So the features affect the reading of the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by illustrating that the route was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on, filled with potential misdirection and physical strain. The misleading information about the distance, combined with the unforgiving landscape, created a situation where the cyclist's safety was constantly compromised, highlighting the inherent risks of his journey.
815	6794	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain was bumpy and had a lot of hills, which meant he had to work much harder to pedal. Also, because of the extreme heat, he was getting dehydrated during his ride. In the story, after the cyclist had been riding a long time, it says, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie). This quote directly shows the physical toll the environment was taking on him. The cyclist had very little water for his long trip, which exacerbated the difficulties posed by the challenging landscape and the relentless sun, making his journey a true test of endurance.
816	6795	3	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disregardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disregards it by going down the hill anyways, choosing to ignore the potential danger. Also, it states that he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” which further demonstrates his initial overconfidence and dismissal of the setting's challenges. This attitude of disregard directly shapes his experience and leads to the difficulties he later faces on his journey.
817	6796	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs, both in the terrain and in his physical state. At one point he flowed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees, an oppressive heat that seemed to radiate from the landscape itself. The weather wouldn’t cool down, creating a constant, draining environment that sapped his strength. This relentless heat was a direct result of the setting and had a profound impact on his endurance and morale throughout the ride.
818	6797	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water, highlighting his physical vulnerability. He was worn out because the setting was so intense and demanding. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This quote from the text shows that the cyclist's terrain was changing and they affected him, forcing him to exert more energy and increasing his thirst. The challenging landscape directly created his need for hydration and contributed to his overall fatigue.
819	6798	3	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one’s body use more energy and leads to dehydration. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels, creating an oppressive atmosphere. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy and strains the muscles. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease significantly. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless and isolated, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist’s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going and ultimately threatens the success of the journey.
820	6799	3	3	Snake, heat, hills—all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamondback, a dangerous creature native to the arid environment. He was going through the desert so it was like one hundred degrees, an extreme and relentless heat. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills that tested his physical limits and resolve. He had a ridiculous and arduous challenge ahead of him, all imposed by the unforgiving features of the setting he was passing through.
821	6800	3	3	"The setting acts as a catalyst in this story, serving as the primary force that continuously challenges the character until the very end. In the story it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This detail is crucial, showing that the very terrain is actively opposing him, making his journey more arduous. Also in the story it says, “The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool."" This statement is not only showing how much the elements are overpowering him, it also shows how vulnerable and at risk he is, and how satirical life can be in its irony. The ultimate challenge in this story is when he stumbles across the Welch's grape juice factory and there was a picture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth."" This image serves as a cruel taunt, emphasizing that no matter where the cyclist goes he is always trying to overcome the relentless elements that define his journey."
822	6801	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, creating a series of obstacles that hinder his progress. For example, the pervasive lack of water begins to take a significant toll on his physical state, directly impacting how fast he can possibly get to the next town as dehydration sets in. Another example would be the difficult terrain, which only slows him down more, forcing him to expend greater energy on rolling hills instead of a flat, manageable path. These environmental factors work in concert to test his limits and prolong his suffering on the road.
823	6802	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it’s intensely hot, and then there’s no one around to help because he's isolated in the deserts of California. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” This excerpt from the text supports the previous statement about how it’s hot because the speaker tells us how he’s sweating profusely and that he might be seeing a mirage, a clear sign of heat stress. “There was no one in sight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind."" This observation shows that there is absolutely no one around to assist him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that, highlighting his profound isolation. So the setting is critically affecting the cyclists endurance, pushing him toward his physical breaking point in the unforgiving landscape."
824	6803	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it profoundly more difficult to ride, introducing physical and mental hurdles. The change in landscape is noted: “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" The extreme heat poses a direct threat to his health, as he thinks, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" Further along, “a large highway sign jumped out at me,"" warning of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,"" which contrasts bitterly with his slow, pained progress and leads him to lament that “sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The fact that it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer and more draining. When out of water you feel completely exhausted and desperate. You will do just about anything to try to withstand the oppressive heat, but the setting provides no relief, ensuring the journey remains a constant struggle."
825	6804	3	3	"Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit."" As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the critical lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to follow had no towns or reliable sources of fresh, drinkable water for days, leaving him increasingly vulnerable. The combination of constant exercise from riding through the rough terrain, the severe lack of water and resources, the oppressive California summer weather, and the utter lack of civilization steadily drained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from acute dehydration. Too much exposure to these harsh conditions could have easily killed him, underscoring the peril. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be inaccurate, and, thus, directly causing the cyclist to find himself in such a dangerous and isolated area of the country. Ultimately, the setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a genuinely life-threatening situation from which escape is a monumental task."
826	6805	3	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, or breezy and humid. The features could be a busy town or a solitary country road; there could be rough terrain or straightaways. The setting of a place puts pressure on the reality of what will happen to a cyclist. In the essay, a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly men and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns, not knowing if he would survive. The intense heat had him feeling as though death were coming for him, and the overwhelming thirst made him more determined to reach the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a cool breeze and places to stop for water everywhere, he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting profoundly affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad, or scared, and he can even start to think about his own death. These are what I believe to be some of the powerful effects settings have on a cyclist.
827	6806	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when the author says “flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills,” that change in terrain made the author have to ride more cautiously and safer. Also, when he says, “the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement,” the author was forced to slow down on his bike and carefully find a safe way around the obstacle so he could get past. Finally, when the author describes a place with “no one in sight, no building, car, or structure,” he is affected because he cannot ask for directions since he is lost, and his thirst becomes a greater concern. In each instance, the setting creates challenges, making it hard for the author to maneuver easily and get to where he wants to go.
828	6807	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the bike was very tired; his legs and body desperately needed a rest after riding for many miles into the pedal. It also affected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do, struggling against the difficult terrain to get where he was trying to go. However, he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling no matter the hardship. He was also restless and physically drained, but his determination saw him through to the end of his challenging journey.
829	6808	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” because it goes through many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and is working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned and desolate. He kept going only to find another abandoned town, increasing his isolation. He decided to press on until he saw a sign, but the terrain had become a lot different with rolling hills, tumbleweed rolling by, and even a snake blocking his path. Through listening to the old men, the cyclist almost died from the threatening, relentless heat and the critical lack of water. Ultimately, the harsh setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have ever imagined at the start of his trip.
830	6809	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, and he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning thinking of Yosemite; he is relaxed and confident. However, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the ramshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not yet discouraged. When the terrain changes to become more difficult, he feels a little more discouraged. Then, when he comes across the completely abandoned factory, he is most definitely a lot more discouraged and concerned. A little later, he comes across a fish camp, and he is very relieved and thankful to the owners for their assistance. The cyclist’s attitude consistently changed depending upon whether the setting was beneficial to him or presented a new hardship.
831	6810	3	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappointing, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affects him physically and emotionally. For instance, when he passes a portion in the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral,” he becomes disturbed by the desolation. The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, “doing a water-deleting 8 mph.” The relentless setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist profoundly and puts him in a state of dehydration, intensifying his struggle. In an, “ironic twist,” the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a Sunsweet factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth, a cruel image which deeply upsets the thirsty cyclist and highlights the harshness of his journey.
832	6811	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the beginning, when the cyclist had just begun his cycling cause, he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says, “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” When he says this the reader imagines someone in an eager and excited state, anticipating his destination on a dry day. As the cyclist's attitude becomes lower, the reader makes the connection that his mood shifts because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen, when the cyclist says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and told myself not to get too excited,” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as he is. Overall, as the setting changes to a “burning sun” and becomes extremely hot, with a shortage of water, the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upbeat. For example, when talking about the rocks in his mouth he states, “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This dark humor shows a bad mood directly affected by the oppressive features of the setting, completing the picture of his decline.
833	6812	3	3	The rougher the road gets for him, the more determination he has at the beginning; however, towards the end he had the mind set that, “it didn’t matter, it was going to die.” This negative outlook took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He then realized he didn’t want to die that way, a thought that sparked a final reserve of will, and so he kept on, pushing forward until eventually leading to civilization. This internal shift, from despair to resolve, underscores the profound psychological impact of his arduous journey.
834	6813	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described, which implies that the biker probably had a hard time. Half way through the story he said, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He said this to describe the increasing difficulty in this race, signaling a change in the challenge he faced. It also makes the narrative seem exciting because it changes things around, introducing new obstacles. It wouldn’t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn’t show the terrain change at all. Thus, the evolving landscape is crucial for driving the story's tension and engagement.
835	6814	3	3	“Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on a rough road with no water, or reliable supply; his limited supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills and large highways. A lone sign jumped out at him. It read: “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road made him have to work harder, want more water, and just made things tougher more than what they already were, encapsulating the central physical conflict of his misadventure.
836	6815	3	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood, a fact clearly illustrated by the cyclist's journey. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains and describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull, with empty streets and silent buildings. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn’t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be a water source and a, “tar like substance oozed out.” That makes him nervous and mad because he isn’t sure he will make it, his spirits sinking lower. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store, a sign of life and potential relief. The setting becomes positive and so does he, his hope returning. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude, demonstrating a powerful connection between environment and emotional state.
837	6816	3	3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist profoundly throughout his arduous trip. One of the features of the desert setting, which is the primary environment, is the dry air and the relentlessly hot temperatures. This intense heat made it hard for the cyclist to keep going, and with despair the author says, “I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” Another significant feature of the setting was the desolate towns that didn’t contain any water, their emptiness amplifying his isolation. This lack of the essential water made it horrible for him to continue on, a constant, grinding hardship. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth, as sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Another poignant features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This particular factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst-stricken state, the irony cutting deep. The narrator called the factory an “Ironic twist,” a cruel joke played by the setting on his desperate hopes.
838	6817	3	3	The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink, because I would have given up having nothing to drink at all. The water itself had to be hot, offering little refreshment. In the text it stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”, and I don’t think I could have lasted long, if I was that dehydrated and weak. From the look of the described conditions, I would have drop dead of heatstroke, completely overwhelmed by the harsh environmental factors. The setting's extreme demands clearly dictate the limits of physical endurance.
839	6818	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist, shaping her experience and her response to the journey's hardships. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the profound lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. She observes, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the intense heat and critical shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot, dehydrated, and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond mere suffering by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can, a mental shift. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that the lack of water has given her a dark humor and the courage to keep going, to persevere and get to her final destination point despite the odds.
840	6819	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways, creating a series of physical and emotional challenges. The bumpy roads made for a difficult and jarring ride. Sand blown into his eyes caused irritation and pain, while an overwhelming thirst hit him, exacerbated by the hot and humid temperatures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling and had to walk his bike for a stretch, adding fatigue to his troubles. A wild dog chased him when he finally got into a town, introducing a new element of fear. To make matters worse, he had no money to buy a drink, leaving him without relief. Each of these environmental factors worked together to shape his difficult journey.
841	6820	3	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his surroundings. While he was riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase significantly. The text reads, “I had been hitting my water bottle regularly.” Due to the intense heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his last reserves of water, consuming large patterns of it at a time. He found himself draining the bottle quickly, a direct consequence of the oppressive and unrelenting sun beating down upon him during his arduous journey.
842	6821	3	3	When the cyclist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. The description of the vast, barren landscape, devoid of any shade or relief, strongly evokes the image of a sun-baked wasteland. I also know that it’s hot because he is sweating and dehydrated, his body struggling to cope with the extreme conditions. His physical state is a clear indicator of the harsh, arid environment he is passing through, which saps his energy and leaves him longing for a reprieve.
843	6822	3	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine; he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he’s fine. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed and at ease, because he is at home with the familiar water and the pine trees. They give him a profound sense of comfort and belonging. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better and more welcoming. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long and arduous way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph.” At that point he starts to get genuinely worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes with a sinking feeling that he doesn’t have enough water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and more forbidding. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, mentioning “a ridiculously large snake.” The landscape changes perceptibly with the state of his water, becoming a mirror of his own growing desperation and physical strain."
844	6823	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist profoundly because the combined heat and complete lack of humanity makes him feel so isolated and crazy. If he was in a place like @LOCATION2, the challenge would be just the heat because there are people everywhere in @LOCATION2, offering potential aid and companionship. The presence of others would mitigate the psychological toll. If he was in @LOCATION1, however, the danger would be compounded by the severe temperature drop and the absolute absence of humanity, and he would probably die from the combined effects of exposure and utter solitude.
845	6824	3	3	The features of the setting that the cyclist runs into do affect him significantly. For example, when the setting changes from a merely abandoned town to an empty, deserted road that no one has been on in thirty years, it gives the cyclist less motivation to push himself to go on. The profound desolation of the place saps his will, leaving him with even less mental strength to continue his journey through the unforgiving landscape.
846	6825	3	3	Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don’t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. The text states, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). The unrelenting heat intensified his dehydration and fatigue. The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on, adding physical strain to his journey. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer, creating a harsh and challenging environment that tests his endurance to its limits.
847	6826	3	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed & some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was runing out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as “water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid.” This disappointment only deepened his thirst and frustration. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water. Each potential source of relief proved to be a mirage, emphasizing the brutal and mocking nature of his surroundings throughout his arduous trek.
848	6827	3	3	Do not Exceed posted speed limit, never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confinses of their porches sin Carter was in the office twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrs. I got down on my hands and kness, working the handle of the rasted water pump with all my strength. The water bottles contained only a few totalt and sips, offering no real relief from his growing thirst. He could or been sad person. And he could just be a bum, reflecting on his dire situation and the unreliable guidance that led him there. This series of misfortunes, stemming from the bad advice and the unforgiving landscape, ultimately teaches a harsh lesson about self-reliance on the open road.
849	6828	3	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text “Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph, a pace that made the difficult journey feel even longer. The harsh environment, marked by the rough road and his slow progress, directly contributed to his physical struggle and mental fatigue. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist, proving that the physical world through which he traveled was a central factor in his challenging experience, shaping the entire narrative of his journey.
850	6829	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, “I’d read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate."" This desperate tactic was his only defense against the oppressive heat. He used that to help him survive the ordeal, demonstrating how the environmental conditions forced him to adapt and rely on primitive survival methods to cope with the relentless challenges posed by the setting until he could find proper relief."
851	6830	3	3	"The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT,"" which felt like a cruel joke given his slow pace. The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy, draining his reserves with each ascent. Also, there were roadblocks; at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake sunning itself on the asphalt. These roadblocks would endanger the biker, for he’d have to maneuver around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water from his limited supply. No water is a great danger, for it was June, a hot day, and he is risking getting dehydrated in the oppressive heat. There was also nobody around, so if he desperately needed water he couldn’t call for help, leaving him completely isolated and vulnerable in the harsh landscape."
852	6831	3	3	After reading “Do not Exceed Posted Limit” I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut, leading him into a difficult situation. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically; he gets tired from peddling up and down continually, a relentless rhythm that saps his strength. “that mood” was replaced by short, moving hills, a landscape that seemed to mock his efforts. The cyclist could not generate any energy and tried everything, not knowing how long he would have to continue going up and down this exhausting terrain. There at one point he says, “I can feel so cruel,” expressing his frustration. There, he is upset because a road sign comes up through the tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour, highlighting the absurdity of his struggle. This can be viewed as metaphorical also; when you take a short cut in life, there are always consequences. If you decide to drop out of high school to go on with your journey, there is always the possibility of it not working, and where you are left with no diploma and limited prospects for a job, a sobering realization that mirrors the cyclist's arduous and ill-advised detour.
853	6832	3	3	In the short story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting effects the cyclist in the story profoundly. For example, the dry hot air begins to slowly dehydrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason as his throat becomes parched and his thinking grows fuzzy. The heat also played tricks on his mind, creating mirages and a sense of disorientation that compounded his physical struggle. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them, each climb demanding a significant output of his dwindling energy. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply far more quickly than he had anticipated. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist, ultimately becoming the primary antagonist in his journey through the unforgiving desert.
854	6833	3	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which he was in had a major affect. He was in California, which contains a big desert, a vast and arid region. In the middle of some of it, it is very hot, with the sun beating down mercilessly. Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quite harsh, exposing him directly to the intense solar radiation. And to be riding around where there is not much civilization, as to where you can’t get water, is a major issue, turning a simple bike ride into a dangerous test of survival where every resource becomes precious.
855	6834	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is a poisonous snake out there, presenting a direct physical threat on the lonely road. You're the only person riding down those hills all by your self, which amplifies the feeling of isolation and potential danger. The guy had said that the next town was many miles from where he was at, a daunting distance that emphasized his remoteness. The lack of water was critical, as there were not any streams or rivers around there; he was just in a desert with nothing to replenish his canteen, making his journey a precarious battle against the elements and his own mounting thirst.
856	6835	3	3	The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry, with the sun blazing relentlessly in a vast, cloudless sky. There is a lack of water in his bag, a concerning realization on such a demanding journey. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads that stretch endlessly before him, each mile more challenging than the last.
857	6836	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, you are in the desert cycling for many hours under a very hot sun and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to carefully conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park, rationing each precious sip. Another example is that you are going up and down rolling hills and your legs get very tired so they don’t want to move any more, burning with fatigue. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and you're sweating so much and you might be seeing things, but all you want to do is see something that has water, a mirage of a cool, clear lake. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much during his arduous journey.
858	6837	3	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the oppressive summer heat in California riding a bike across a barren landscape. After several minutes of this, you will become intensely thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating under the harsh sun, the water supply has nearly ran out, leaving only a few warm drops. Not having enough water can cause a person to become dehydrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die, a serious risk in such a remote place. So as you can see, the cyclist is profoundly affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the extreme heat and by the critical lack of water, which together create a perilous situation.
859	6838	3	3	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place, a desert under a scorching sun. Meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles, just arid land and dusty brush. Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there, making the journey feel incredibly isolated. This quote supports there weren’t many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.'' This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, leaving the cyclist so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst '' this clearly shows the man was very thirsty, resorting to desperate measures. Also it was so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where but as a cruel trick of the mind. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions, pushing the cyclist to his very limits.
860	6839	3	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways, winding unpredictably through the harsh terrain, and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up, straining his already tired muscles. The cyclist has many miles before he gets to a town and he could run out of water, a constant worry on his mind. If he run out of water before he gets there, he might have to make stops so he does not make hisself sick from exhaustion and dehydration. When he gets to the town he can get more water, a simple goal that provides the only motivation to continue pushing forward through the difficult landscape.
861	6840	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thirsty for most of his way. As he rode, the relentless sun beat down upon him, and he started to get tired slowly, becoming more and more thirsty with each passing mile. He drank his water at first without thinking too much of it, taking large, careless gulps. But as he went on, he slowly found himself trying to conserve it, taking only small, measured sips to wet his parched throat. By the time he got to the second wild town, his will was so depleted from being thirsty and tired that he thought the sight might have been a ""death,"" a final hallucination. So he wiped the stinging sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when they are hot, tired, and about to kill for some water. This is precisely what the cyclist was like after his long and arduous journey to Yosemite National Park, a trek made all the more challenging by the vague directions given by old men."
862	6841	3	3	The features of the setting include that there is no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, which describes the desolate trail the cyclist was taking. The vast, empty landscape stretched out before him, an unbroken expanse of sand and scrub under a wide, unforgiving sky. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his profound isolation and his growing doubt over whether he will survive or not, with no sign of help or civilization to bolster his spirits. The utter loneliness of the place amplified his fears, making every pedal stroke a battle against despair as much as against the terrain itself.
863	6842	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist throughout his journey. The sight of a speed limit sign, a cruel reminder of a pace he could not hope to match on his bicycle, makes him feel like life is inherently unfair and cruel. His first glimpse of the Welch's Juice factory on the horizon, a beacon of potential refreshment, makes him feel a surge of excitement and renewed hope. Conversely, meeting the deserted fork in the road, with its unclear and untraveled paths, makes him feel deeply troubled and uncertain about his chosen direction. When he finally gets to his destination, the cumulative relief from overcoming these environmental challenges washes over him, leaving him feeling profoundly relieved. These are all clear examples showing that the various features of the setting directly affected the cyclist's emotional state and experience.
864	6843	3	3	"The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist and his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California, as stated at the end of the paragraph: ""and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The high deserts of California are known to be windy, sandy, dry, and intensely hot, creating a harsh and demanding environment. This is not something that someone should ideally be cycling on, as the conditions are physically draining. Had the setting been the mountainous regions of California, the weather would not have been so hot, and the cyclist would not have been as tired because the mountains are generally a cooler, although still dry, place. Had he been cycling there, he would have preferred a different setting, such as the mountains, over an arid desert, as that way he would not have had to endure the extreme discomfort this cyclist experienced on his grueling ride."
865	6844	3	3	The features of the setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California, which is a really hot place during the summer, amplifying his physical strain. The cyclist had significant problems because of the oppressive weather and the critical shortness of water. Since there was a shortage of water, he had to conserve it carefully, which inevitably slowed him down because he couldn't ride as hard or as long without proper hydration. Although there was a brief respite from a cool wind and the distant sight of a river from Yosemite, he had to pass quickly down the hill, meaning he could not fully enjoy these comforts and thus faced even more problems. This combination of environmental factors is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and ultimately determined how much he could ride on his challenging journey.
866	6845	3	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the story, it talks about how the man is pedaling twenty miles here and forty miles there and it's very hot outside and he only has so much water and he doesn't think he'll make it to where he was to go because it's so hot that he needs more water. As the narrator says, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,"" which is extremely hot in California in June. The desert's hot weather made him limited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, with no buildings or people around, makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endangered him, and the bumpy, uneven road made it harder for him to hold on to his handlebars and get to somewhere safe. ""I began breaking the ride into distance I could see on the horizon, telling myself if I could make it to that point I'd be fine."" This quote shows his struggle because of the vast, unforgiving area he was in but also his persistence and will to continue. Ultimately, the various features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist in this essay."
867	6846	3	3	Many features of the cyclist’s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings for miles. It’s like he’s on the open countryside, surrounded by empty fields and a long, straight road ahead. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won’t hit anything and there are no obstacles in his path. The fact that he’s alone in the wide, open spaces, with a clear view for miles, boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident and free as he rides. This sense of isolation and freedom directly contributes to his increased speed and self-assurance on the journey.
868	6847	3	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would be about seventy degrees outside and sunny, with a clear blue sky. You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move properly in the deep snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and wet, and you could get in a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you will be able to ride freely on dry, clean roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed by the pleasant air. That is why I believe it is important for the weather and the setting to be just right for a safe and enjoyable bike ride.
869	6848	3	3	This story is set in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. The setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the vast, empty desert with no one to help him. This quote, “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first ‘town’. The place might have been a thriving little spot as one time”. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around, no place to re-hydrate, no place to get directions; he was completely alone and isolated in his journey. The abandoned nature of the so-called towns highlights the challenging and lonely impact of the setting on the cyclist.
870	6849	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, and thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town, empty and desolate. The second offered only rusty, warm water that slightly resembled battery acid, which was barely drinkable. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from the severe lack of good water and from having to cross the now hilly, difficult terrain. He barely makes it to the third town only to realize that the juice factory was out of business, crushing his hopes. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a lone bait store in the distance. If it hadn’t been so intensely hot, if the “towns” along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn’t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the aforementioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist's physical state and his chances of survival.
871	6850	3	3	The intense heat, the unforgiving terrain, and the profound isolation of the setting all significantly affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and pushed him to the brink of dehydration. There was no place to stop for water, and if he did find a source, the water was often bad and unpleasantly warm, offering little relief. Second, the different types of terrain, from steep inclines to rocky paths, made the cyclist really thirsty also and increasingly tired, draining his energy with every pedal stroke. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere, a vast and empty landscape where he couldnít get water to hydrate himself or find a proper place to sit down and rest. This combination of environmental factors created a truly grueling experience for the rider, testing his physical and mental limits throughout the journey.
872	6851	3	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one, presenting constant challenges to his endurance. He had little water to begin with, and his area had tough, varied terrains that were difficult to navigate. As he recalls, ìI was travelling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (@NUM1), a time of extreme heat. He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go, a daunting prospect. This mirrors a personal experience where I went on a bike ride that was many miles long in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break, much like the author's predicament. The terrain was tough, just like the authorís terrain, relentless and exhausting. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, a vivid description of his disorientation, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I donít have to bike in that terrain, having learned from such a harsh example of what cyclists can endure.
873	6852	3	3	The cyclist in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1î was riding through the California dessert in June, a time of extreme aridity. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water for miles on end. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and it was tasting strongly of battery acid, utterly undrinkable. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles, which compounded his suffering. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily, his progress reduced to a crawl. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone, a clear sign of his exhaustion. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a ìshort cutî, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water or supplies. This ìshort cutî prolonged his trip, most likely by hours, adding to his ordeal. If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster and recover. The dry, hot setting of the old menís ìshort cutî made this cyclistís trip last much longer than nessiarry, a testament to how the environment can dictate the outcome of a journey.
874	6853	3	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride, filled with optimism. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ìThings began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î As he got further into the desert, he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere, a truly remote location. The scenery was getting more and more empty, with fewer signs of life. There was eventually nothing but vast, open space. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert, creating a deep sense of despair. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, ìa large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î He realized this was going to be hard, a physical trial. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit, adding danger to his fatigue. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned and lifeless. When he finally saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved, the first sign of civilization and potential aid in a long time.
875	6854	3	3	When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding, believing in his own strength and preparation. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey, each one testing his resolve. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town, a place that offered no respite. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (kurmaskie @NUM1), he notes, highlighting the harsh conditions. The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water wisely and his ìwater bottles contained only a few tantalizing sipsî (kurmaskie @NUM1), a frightening discovery. On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable, beating down on him relentlessly. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly, his body struggling to cope. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads, which were rough and demanding. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships, proving his resilience against the elements.
876	6855	3	3	The features of the setting put a significant affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him, offering advice that was more nostalgic than navigational. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds blowing across his path, and a ridiculously large snake slithering over the cracked asphalt. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play, the relentless sun sapping his strength with every turn of the pedals. Ultimately, these environmental factors combined to create a perilous and exhausting journey for the unprepared rider.
877	6856	3	3	One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water, as the scorching sun demands constant hydration. Another factor is the limited supply of water, with only a single bottle to last for miles of arid landscape. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men. Aged people arenít always wrong but their info can be out of date, leading a traveler down forgotten or nonexistent paths. In the end, these challenges highlight the critical importance of accurate information and sufficient resources for any journey.
878	6857	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water, his throat parched and his body weakening. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration, a desperate search for survival. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be ìThere was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is ìwise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadenít been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly, trapping him in a vast and unforgiving emptiness.
879	6858	3	3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesnít have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water, a fundamental resource for such a trek. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation; the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him, both physically and mentally. He described this with sentences like ìRattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.î The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water, his body pushed to its absolute limits. The author was getting heat stroke being passed by desert snakes and tumbleweeds, symbols of a landscape indifferent to his plight. The author was clearly in a struggle against the desert heat, a battle he was dangerously close to losing.
880	6859	3	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food; they might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not for the entire route. In the story I just read he didnít bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble, stranded without a clear way forward. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no access to food or water, making proper planning an essential part of any successful ride.
881	6860	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was in a desert in the month of June, which was exceptionally hot and dry. There were also no trees around, so there was no shade for him to rest in, and the sun was beating directly on his back. The terrain presented a significant challenge, with many hills that required great strength to climb, such as the one described as ""over one long, crippling hill."" Furthermore, his path included a big, crazy twist, and he even encountered a snake, adding to the difficulty. All of these environmental factors combined to exhaust him. His limited water supply and the relentless sun led to dehydration and heat. With no available shade, he was forced to endure the sun's direct rays. The constant exertion of navigating and jumping over the numerous hills drained his energy reserves. Since these challenges occurred in rapid succession without any respite, they collectively contributed to his profound state of fatigue, ultimately wearing him out completely."
882	6861	3	3	In the story, the narrative explained the beauty of the night and the outdoors, detailing how these elements were affecting his journey. The features of the setting profoundly effect the cyclist because the environment was mild, sounding warm and calm, which provided a stark contrast to the hardships of the day. The text also showed how this serene setting connects to us as readers, creating a moment of shared experience. The peaceful nature of the setting was similar to the cyclist's own inner state during this respite, offering a temporary harmony with his surroundings. That is how the specific features of the setting, through their tranquility and beauty, positively effect the cyclist and his experience on the trip.
883	6862	3	3	The cyclist was traveling through California in the month of June, a time when the sun was relentlessly beating down on him. This intense heat made the ride profoundly difficult, especially when coupled with his short supply of water. To compound his challenges, the man came upon several towns that were completely abandoned, which eliminated any chance of replenishing his dwindling water supply and made his situation more precarious. The terrain itself was demanding, beginning as long and straight stretches that then turned into a series of tall hills, which would have been extremely difficult to ride up under such harsh conditions. These combined factors of heat, scarcity, and arduous geography created a deeply challenging journey for the cyclist, testing his endurance at every turn.
884	6863	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist primarily through the condition of the roads, the rolling hills, and the intense heat. The poor conditions of the road in the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough and unpredictable. An example from the text is, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” These conditions make it hard for the cyclist, presenting him with a physical challenge. The rolling hills challenge him and require great effort to stay on the road; the path is easily tricky and demanding. The heat and sun also played a significant role in affecting the cyclist. An example from the text is, “I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat up…” The sun was starting to get to him, and it would become even sharper and more draining as he rode further into the high desert. In conclusion, these various features in the setting affected the cyclist in many challenging ways, but he kept pushing himself to move on despite the adversity.
885	6864	3	3	"In the setting of ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" a cyclist is riding a bike really fast on a rough road. The uneven and broken surface of the road presents a significant hazard, challenging the rider's control and balance at high speed. This dangerous combination of velocity and difficult terrain creates a tense and precarious situation for the cyclist, highlighting the inherent risks of the journey and the demanding nature of the environment through which he travels."
886	6865	3	3	The cyclist encountered a couple of significant effects during his journey. One of them was the hills, which presented a major problem because the steep inclines used most of his energy and significantly slowed his progress. The other critical factor was water, or rather the profound lack of it. If he had possessed enough water, he would have received a vital boost that would have sustained his energy and kept him going through the difficult terrain. Ultimately, these two challenges combined to create an extremely arduous trip for the rider.
887	6866	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the distinct features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”, a description that hints at a hot and dry climate where the temperature was relentlessly high. Consequently, he must have been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the constant sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through a series of hills, and as common sense would suggest, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle, especially uphill, and this strenuous activity wears a person down. These formidable hills, along with a critical lack of water, must have tired him out completely and given him extreme difficulty, making it a challenge to continue without adequate hydration. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays its crucial part in shaping the cyclist's experience and depleting his precious water supply, demonstrating the environment's powerful impact.
888	6867	3	3	The setting severely affects the cyclist because he cannot take the intense heat. His water supply is running dangerously low and he is becoming dehydrated, a fact highlighted when the character states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke.” This quotation clearly indicates he is afraid he might pass out and potentially die before he manages to find more water. The harsh environmental conditions thus pose a direct threat to his physical well-being and safety.
889	6868	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several distinct ways throughout his ordeal. The first place he arrived at was a “ghost town”, which offered no relief. Then he reached a water pump about twenty miles up the road, but the water was very hot and tasted extremely nasty. The text states, “…water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees…when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” Consequently, he had to continue travelling without water and became severely dehydrated. While travelling up and down the exhausting hills, he thought he began to imagine a building that could possibly provide him with water. The building was indeed there but it was completely abandoned. He decided he was going to suck on a couple of pebbles out of desperation, as the text says, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst…” This series of disappointments shows how the landscape continuously thwarted his efforts to find sustenance.
890	6869	3	3	"It is immensely hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired, and suffering from a lack of water. The statement “I checked my water supply and heated on” is a good example of his preoccupation with his dwindling resources. There are also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around, and this isolation bars the cyclist's hope of finding civilization. Furthermore, not seeing any buildings, or when he does see one, finding it deserted, makes the journey very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he reaches the pump that yields only tar, dirt, and then unbearably hot water. Also, the road itself plays a toll on him, which is evident when he says, “If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I’ll be alright"". This demonstrates how the setting and its features are affecting the cyclist both mentally and physically throughout his challenging trek."
891	6870	3	3	The intense, unrelenting heat is a primary reason why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding, with the sun beating down mercilessly. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated and suffering from heat exhaustion. Furthermore, the cyclist is completely alone and there is nothing in sight for miles, just an empty, barren landscape. If anything happened to him, such as a mechanical failure or a fall, there is no one around to help or offer assistance. Compounding this isolation, the cyclist had very little water remaining and had to conserve it carefully in order to stay active and have enough energy to continue. With very little water, it is incredibly hard to stay hydrated in such oppressive conditions. The combination of the heat, the profound solitude, and the critical lack of water are all powerful reasons why the features of the setting so profoundly affect the cyclist.
892	6871	3	3	The specific terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them, both physically and mentally. The first example of this is when they are riding on steep hills, as it makes the physical exertion much harder for them, demanding greater stamina. For example, when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on a series of daunting hills he was, obviously disappointed and daunted by the challenge ahead. Another thing that significantly affects a cyclist is the smoothness, or lack thereof, of the road surface they are riding on. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the main character came to a rough, broken spot in the road and was deeply disappointed and didn’t want to ride it, fearing damage to his bike or a loss of control. Another critical aspect that can affect cyclists is the extreme heat of the environment. Several times in the story, the cyclist says that he is tired and dangerously dehydrated, at one point he vividly thinks he is going to die of heatstroke under the scorching sun. Those are the various and significant effects that the rider’s setting can have on him/her.
893	6872	3	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major and evolving effect on the cyclist's physical state and morale. The setting is the high deserts of California where it is June and very hot, creating a harsh and unforgiving environment. The specific path for the cyclist, suggested by some old men, makes the heat even worse because there are no people or sources of water in sight, amplifying his isolation. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park, full of anticipation. His mood changes dramatically throughout the day as after many miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off, only to find it abandoned. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run critically low on water and feels that ""sometimes life can feel so cruel,"" a sentiment born from his dire circumstances. The intense heat and the utter lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going to die,"" a stark reflection of his despair. The setting of the cyclist's journey provides the mood of hopelessness and simultaneously amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he believed he was going to die if he stopped moving. The author uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his message that by blindly trusting people instead of trusting yourself and your own preparations, things could end up being incredibly hard for you to overcome."
894	6873	3	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings that each influence his journey. When he left it was early summer and it was already pretty hot outside, signaling a challenging day ahead. He rode into the morning sun which would contribute to him feeling tired as the day wore on. The first town he reaches upon was a desolate ghost town, so that meant he could not rest or get his needed supplies as he had hoped, dashing his expectations. Then he arrived by cool pines and a rushing river, an environment which probably made him feel momentarily relaxed and rejuvenated. Later, he showed up at a ramshackle shed with several rusty pumps and a corroded barrel that couldn’t hold in the lamest made water, a place that offered only disappointment. Gated men who were present made him feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, and the pumps ultimately did not give him the water he desperately needed, so that was another opportunity lost, with nobody around to offer clear directions. Finally, he was riding through the vast California deserts in June, an arid landscape which probably made him feel even more dehydrated and exhausted from the relentless heat. These successive settings chart his journey from hope to despair.
895	6874	3	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men, as it proved to be dangerously misleading. Following the marked map would have been a lot safer and easier, providing a reliable and proven path. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself, often without fully considering the potential risks involved. He could have died from severe heat stroke and a critical lack of water out in the isolated desert. He did have remarkable perseverance, though; he never gave up and that relentless determination is ultimately what saved him, pushing him forward through the ordeal. Being in that desperate situation and harsh setting, I believe I would have likely given up, unlike the cyclist whose will to survive was stronger than the oppressive environment.
896	6875	3	3	When cycling it is important to make yourself aware of the type of terrain it is, such as whether it is flat, hilly, or mountainous, make sure of the weather, including the forecast for rain or extreme heat, make sure of the environment, like the availability of services or shelter, and most importantly make sure of your resources, particularly your water supply and physical stamina. These things are key before taking any cycling trip. They are very important in determining the type of trip you will have, leading to an enjoyable and relaxing trip, or resulting in a long and miserable trip. Proper preparation is therefore the fundamental difference between a successful journey and a difficult one.
897	6876	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by forcing him to travel very far to where he is going, through a vast and demanding landscape. For example, ""About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town,"" which underscores the great distance he had to cover. It was a good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would have survived or not in such an isolated area. I think the biggest mistake was that he asked probably someone that had not ever been on the road for directions, a decision that proved costly. When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that misleading direction was probably the most effective feature that has happened to him, sealing his fate on a difficult path."
898	6877	3	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed” by @PERSON1 the settings of the story effects the rider in many ways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty and sapping his energy. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him; the landscape is barren and empty. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water, adding to the affect of dehydration and making him more thirsty and desperate. The rider says “One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn’t hold the lamestmal egreeted me."" This statement from the author supports the fact that nothing is around, emphasizing the desolation. One more feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills, which were steep and unrelenting. The hills made the rider tired, requiring more pedaling and wearing him out significantly; the setting features had a great affect on the rider from heat and dehydration to hills and energy loss. One thing that the setting didn't have was a positive affected on the rider, as every element conspired against his progress."
899	6878	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out, creating a sense of urgency and danger. He got the wrong directions from some old men so he would have to ride his bike longer than he had to, and he would need more water from pedaling all that way for nothing, a frustrating and exhausting detour. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water from, there were no people around so he couldn’t communicate for assistance, and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the oppressive heat. This isolation and lack of resources defined his challenging experience.
900	6879	3	3	In the story, the rider faced several melancholy sites that tested his resolve. For examples the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for further directions or somewhere to freshen up, leaving him completely alone. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over, demanding great physical effort. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back, feeling the weight of his situation. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down, showing his determination. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him, intensifying his struggle. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him, marking the journey as a true test of endurance against the elements.
901	6880	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when he checks a well, ""A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because he cant get water from the well, which means he desperately needs water but cannot get any. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad, with rough roads and hills, so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder in the hot reek. So all this puts a negative affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up, highlighting his desperation. In this essay the setting had alot of affect on the cyclist to were he thought he might die from the harsh conditions."
902	6881	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he’s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June, under a scorching sun. This shows the author is probably very hot and suffering from the extreme temperature. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps, becoming difficult to navigate. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill, increasing his exhaustion. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the “towns” he came to were abandoned and uncared for, with no signs of life. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would not be able to get water or supplies for his trip, leaving him without aid.
903	6882	3	3	The cyclist is affected in many ways by his environment. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water, which becomes a constant source of anxiety. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water and his growing thirst. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route, regretting his decision to follow bad advice. For example, he thinks, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The cyclist says things about the older gentle man throughout the story, blaming him for the dire situation he finds himself in on the unforgiving road.
904	6883	3	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and now he feels, demonstrating a clear connection between his environment and his mental state. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood, feeling frustrated and defeated. Mood is highly affected by the general setting, which can either uplift or depress a person. In the essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist feels very confiedent of himself at the beginning, and the initially promising setting helps to boost that confiedence and andorence for the journey ahead, before the conditions worsen.
905	6884	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly during his arduous journey. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you’ve been riding for more than fifty miles under the relentless sun. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear and physical distress in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive from such a perilous situation.
906	6885	3	3	That the cyclist is steadily climbing up a totally steep incline within the desert when he begins to consider how and when to get to his destination. The town he had settled on reaching out of necessity seemed to have been taken away, its meaning lost just yesterday. The condition of the road is rough on his hands and he feels a hurry some of the time, a pressing need to move forward when he has nothing left in his body. The physical toll of the journey is immense, and the unforgiving landscape offers no respite, pushing him to his absolute limits as he continues his arduous trek toward a distant and uncertain goal.
907	6886	3	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example, in the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office, and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as the traditional definition of a ghost town. This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule” was what met him there. The cyclist said that this sight was troubling. The profound desolation of the place saps his spirit, leading him to a point of utter hopelessness. It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story shows how a harsh and unforgiving environment can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.
908	6887	3	3	I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited. For example, the “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” provide advice that is outdated and no longer applicable to the current, harsh realities of the road. This means that now it is time for the older people to relax and watch the younger people, but their well-intentioned guidance ultimately leads the cyclist astray, leaving him unprepared for the severe challenges he subsequently faces on his journey through the desolate landscape.
909	6888	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example, in the text he writes “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.” That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him were making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost believe that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head, a poignant symbol of his own deprivation. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
910	6889	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affected the cyclist in the story. “Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy than flat riding. This energy loss, coupled with the cyclist's lack of water, causes him to become even more miserable and physically drained. The challenging geography directly intensifies his physical suffering and mental fatigue. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.
911	6890	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist's mood and behavior. First, the cyclist sees a potential shortcut and begins believing it will help him arrive to Yosemite faster, but he soon realizes it will not. Next, the harsh sun and the rough terrain, combined with a critical lack of water, causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to Yosemite. This difficult experience causes him to rethink his initial judgement and the importance of taking advice from others, ultimately teaching him a valuable lesson about preparation.
912	6891	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after passing the first ""ghost town"" he was getting weak and his energy began to fade. Then the cyclist had to face a series of difficult problems. For example, he was running dangerously low on water, which heightened his anxiety. Also, he faced rough roads that jarred his body, and last, he faced the threat of snakes and a profound sense of abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles that tested his spirit, but in the end, he pulled through strong, demonstrating his resilience."
913	6892	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.” That shows how the features affected the cyclist because he explicitly states the sight was troubling. It troubled him deeply because he desperately wanted water and he saw the rusty pumps that reminded him of water, but he knew there was no water to be had or that it was likely nasty. This encounter intensified his feeling of desolation and thirst.
914	6893	3	3	The conditions of the environment as well as the road can majorly effect the cyclist. For example, if someone was riding a bike in warm weather on flat land it would not take major determination to pedal and the journey would be relatively easy. On the other hand, if it is extremely hot with rough paths and hilly roads, the biker could dehydrate quickly and it takes much more physical effort to get up and over the hill. Those factors demonstrate how the conditions of the environment effect a cyclist greatly, determining the level of challenge and endurance required.
915	6894	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand under his wheels. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant, adding to the peril. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone with no one to help. A grape juice factory taunts him, mocks him with its unattainable promise of refreshment, but he continues on, with a steady pace despite the hardship. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere in the vast landscape. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom, finding the relief he so desperately needed.
916	6895	3	3	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy turns. The sheer physical exertion required to navigate this landscape was immense. Also, there was no one around, no houses, buildings or people which made him feel alone and like he was going to die. This profound isolation amplified his distress. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story, “Over one long, crippling hill a building came into view!” This quote shows how the hills in the setting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited and relieved he was to see it, a stark contrast to the emptiness. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist, shaping his difficult journey through a challenging and lonely environment.
917	6896	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don’t even know the area anymore. So riding through this, the man seems lost; he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” highlighting his growing frustration. Then he comes to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enough he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road, a direct and frightening obstacle. Coming over these things was very strong and hard on this young man, testing his resolve and physical endurance throughout his arduous trip.
918	6897	3	3	The desert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing there would be no refills because the pump was only giving a “tar-like substance” said the text. With the lack of water, dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man, causing him significant physical strain. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ridiculously large snake” he had seen, making an already dangerous encounter even more perilous. A final effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by “[wiping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” showing his desperate hope. Through all the toughest desert obstacles the character was able to take the short cut and survive the heat, dehydration, and animals of the desert, completing his challenging journey.
919	6898	3	3	"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is hot because the text says, ""somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees."" This implies that it is very hot outside, creating a harsh riding condition. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" This shows that the people in towns didn't help him, leading him astray. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a snake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit."" This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road, directly impacting his ride. You know there is a snake because the text says, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the road,"" presenting a clear physical danger. I think there are many implied and expressed details in the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit"" that show how the setting challenged the cyclist."
920	6899	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very severe situation. The cyclist was in a desert-like terrain, which was not densely populated on his trail; there was a lack of fresh water supplies, and the temperatures were more extreme. The cyclist could easily have fainted from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that he was doing pedaling, pushing his body to its limits. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water, greatly decreasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presented danger for him; had he been bitten then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closest help which could have proven fatal, isolating him in a crisis. Had the setting been, say, a city park or a populated countryside, then this setting would have provided exponentially fewer problems and dangers for the cyclist, underscoring how the harsh environment itself was the greatest antagonist.
921	6900	3	3	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June,” which highlights the cruel irony of suffering on a beautiful day. Also, he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul,” indicating his awareness of his dwindling water supply at a steady, draining pace. The physical exertion combined with the intense heat created a perilous situation. In conclusion, this cyclist started this journey without enough water and under a harsh sun, causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.
922	6901	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he’s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This quote shows that he was just beginning to run out of water, having consumed his supply steadily. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all, with the last drops being insufficient. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car, as the remote and arid environment offers no relief.
923	6902	3	3	In the essay the setting had every thing to do with the cyclist cause he is ridding through the desert with batey tay water. He is pedaling through the dry heat thats tough even you had water, and the journey is made more difficult by the physical terrain. Pluse there were hills and the threat of deadly snakes, adding to the inherent dangers of the landscape. Its dangerous enough with out that stuff being there, making the cyclist's ordeal a serious struggle for survival. So I would listen to the cyclist & never ever listen to old men, as their advice can lead one into such perilous situations.
924	6903	3	3	"On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with, and this adds to the cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule."" By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself, a place that could almost strand him without aid. He described the terrain with “short, rolling hils” and “over one long, crippling hill.” This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through on a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help, as the landscape itself misdirected him. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp, finally finding safety. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic, directly shaping his difficult experience."
925	6904	3	3	“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers,” and the setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy for a single ride. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe, given the extreme temperatures. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down, yet at that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, so the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much, adding physical strain. The setting basically made the story, providing the central conflict. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life, but the setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through in such harsh conditions.
926	6905	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a great deal. It does so because the road is not in good condition, with potholes and uneven surfaces, and he has to travel a long distance while also contending with bad weather. This combination of factors affects him because he might get dehydrated from the physical exertion and exposure. The difficult terrain and harsh climate create a challenging journey. In conclusion, there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his arduous trip.
927	6907	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly because if there weren’t steep hills and rough roads, he would have been able to get to Yosemite Park faster and with less effort. The challenging landscape slowed his progress considerably. Consequently, he wouldn’t have run out of water so early in his journey. The difficult terrain directly contributed to his shortage of supplies. Therefore, the physical characteristics of the environment played a crucial role in his predicament.
928	6908	3	3	The setting was the main effect on the cyclist. He explicitly said it was extremely hot and that he was completely lost. The cyclist had no clue where he was going and it was hot outside, which compounded his problems. He seemed very stressed and the disorientation only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all the riding and the intense heat, so he tries to get water from a roadside water pump. The water that was in it was horrible; he called it a “substance” that had a flavor of battery acid. If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. Ultimately, the setting of a hot and unfamiliar place had a huge impact on the cyclist and his state of mind.
929	6909	3	3	In my opinion the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking about the terrain changing from long straight roads to sharp windy ones and the speed limit changing, he said he was doing a water-depleting fury and sounds like he is having a hard time. The difficult landscape saps his energy and morale. It seems he doesn't want to go on under these strenuous conditions. The alteration in the road's character presents a significant physical challenge. Thus, the environmental features directly influence his cycling experience and his willingness to continue.
930	6910	3	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert, the cyclist is profoundly affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes he's running out of water, stating, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because he's becoming overheated and has a dangerously low supply of water. Also, the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June” (Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the intense heat of the desert is taking a severe toll on him, both physically and mentally. The harsh environmental conditions are the primary source of his escalating crisis.
931	6911	3	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist a great deal. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down, out-of-date town which didn't help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and oppressively hot, which brings another problem: the cyclist was dehydrating because he didn't have enough water. He would begin to hallucinate and see things that weren't there, a direct result of his worsening physical state. He became very tired in the hot sun, his energy sapped by the relentless heat. So the setting in this short story affected the cyclist in many ways, proving to be a significant antagonist in his journey.
932	6912	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly because of the condition he is in without any water. The cyclist would likely be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not too far into his journey, a problem exacerbated by the intense heat of the setting he was in. The cyclist makes this statement: ""I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" The cyclist is saying that since it is so hot where he is, he has to take regular drinks of water to stay hydrated throughout his trip. It is also implied that in the mountains, with less air and the extreme heat, he is not doing as well as he thought he would, his body struggling against the dual challenges of altitude and temperature."
933	6913	3	3	"The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to his destination. It is easy to bike if you are on flat, smooth terrain, but when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot."" He was sweating and getting dehydrated, leading him to recall, ""I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst."" He had eighteen miles to the next town without much water, a daunting prospect. The first deserted town didn't have any drinkable water, dashing his hopes for a quick resupply. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and this experience highlights the importance of always being prepared and knowing where you are going."
934	6914	3	3	The cyclist has to endure rough terrain and bad road conditions, and a lack of water in the area near him did not help the problem. There was a good possibility he could have suffered heatstroke, a real danger given his circumstances. Then his hope was still lifted by the sight of an abandoned Welch's take factory, a brief respite in his arduous journey. This momentary discovery provided a flicker of optimism, though it ultimately underscored the desolation of his surroundings and the severity of his physical ordeal.
935	6915	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching desert and sparse plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the desert he keeps on worrying about his water supply and heatstroke, whereas if he were in a rain forest he wouldn't worry about water or heat. I think he psyched himself out just by taking in his surroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic-like temperatures I think he wouldn't have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn't have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.” (Kurmaskie). If the cyclist would have concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him, I think he would have succeeded without as much stress, his mind proving to be as challenging an obstacle as the landscape itself.
936	6916	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in that the harsh, arid environment made him use up his water supply and tested his determination to its very limit. His thought, “Sometimes life can be so cruel,” strongly implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the oppressive setting he was in, a place that offered no relief. To himself he thought he was gonna die at any moment, a belief fueled by the relentless sun and the seemingly endless, barren landscape that stretched out before him. This profound sense of despair, directly caused by his surroundings, nearly overwhelmed his will to continue, showcasing the powerful influence of the setting on his mental state.
937	6917	3	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,” the author is continually depressed by the bleak and discouraging features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water at that point, this sight doesn’t bother him significantly. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a “rusted water pump,” and this troubles him deeply because he is acutely aware that he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood at all, because the snake is intimidating and blocking his path. Then he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water, seeing it as a cruel irony. The setting and its features consistently serve to disappoint and depress the cyclist in his increasingly desperate quest to find water, each new sight deepening his hopelessness.
938	6918	3	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” a cyclist is faced with many problems that test his endurance. It’s really hot out, practically a desert, and it’s in June, which means the heat is at its most intense. Just knowing that makes me want some water, highlighting the cyclist's own pressing need. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasn’t got to the place he needs to be, creating a race against time. The roads are hills and bumpy, which make it harder for him, sapping his already diminished energy. Those are the significant problems this cyclist is faced with, each one compounding the other to create a truly challenging journey through an unforgiving environment.
939	6919	3	3	At first the narrator in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was energetic and enthusiastic about their journey to Yosemite National Park. After getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts, the cyclist sets out for an adventure with high hopes. First thing they encounter is a ghost town. The gentlemen they had taken advice from had assured them it was a booming, prosperous town, so this discovery set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist's mind. Then the lack of water began to be a serious issue. They were travelling through the high deserts of California in June and were slowly running out of water, which increased their anxiety. Flat road was soon replaced by short, rolling hills which only increased the cyclist's state of deliriousness and physical exhaustion. After a few more disappointments, such as the non-functional water pump, the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die. The reader is partly drawn in, believing that this is the end for the cyclist, so invested in the narrative. All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you can’t stop reading because you have to find out what happens, proving that if it weren’t for the pervasive hopelessness of the setting you wouldn’t care as deeply about the outcome.
940	6920	3	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through a vast and empty desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat road and dirt, a monotonous and draining vista. He is riding on the road, hopelessly hoping for some form of life or respite. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” a description that emphasizes his profound isolation. The author is trying to be positive but it’s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down with its unrelenting barrenness. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert, a truly terrifying predicament. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn’t be that worried, as there would be water and shade readily available. He has none of that in the desert, only exposure and scarcity. This whole journey was all mental, a test of his spirit. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok, a mantra that provided a sliver of comfort. That is what helped him survive the ordeal, his unwavering mental fortitude. This is an inspiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stay optimistic even when circumstances seem dire.
941	6921	3	3	Poor directions, intense heat, and a critical lack of water profoundly affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning, the cyclist is supremely confident in the directions which promised to, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” As the story progresses, however, the cyclist is no longer so confident, his assurance eroded by the harsh environment. The oppressive “heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.” He notes, “I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This escalating lack of water becomes a monumental problem, so severe that he was near heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance ultimately paid off. “Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water, a discovery that marked the end of his ordeal and the restoration of his hope.
942	6922	3	3	The distinct features of the setting directly affect the cyclist throughout his journey. I say this because the setting is in the hot, arid deserts of California. Under the relentless sun, the cyclist becomes sweaty and tired, his energy sapped, and he finds himself with almost no water left in his bottles. This severe lack of water, combined with the exhausting heat, makes the cyclist desperate for any source of sustenance, for food and water to keep him going. The setting, with its unforgiving climate and isolated landscape, has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens, dictating his desperation and his ultimate drive to survive the challenging conditions.
943	6923	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, compounding his difficulties at every turn. First, because there was no one in sight across the vast, empty landscape, he couldn’t ask for any help or direction, leaving him entirely alone in his struggle. Also, because of all the poor road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky, uneven roads; he was already very tired and dehydrated so that didn’t help him and it just tired him more, draining his remaining strength. Another reason is because of the threat of poisonous snakes; if he disturbed them they could harm him, adding a layer of constant danger. Also, if he had fallen off his bike on the rough terrain, a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn’t be able to make it anywhere because of the venomous bite. Those are the key features of the setting that significantly affected the cyclist and his perilous journey.
944	6924	3	3	"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally, creating a dual burden. It affects him physically because of the relentless rolling hills he has to trudge over and the critical lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak, along with the challenge of the rough terrain that jars his body with every turn. The lack of water doesn’t help any when he’s thirsty and exhausted because of the hills, deepening his physical distress. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more delirious he gets from heat and exhaustion. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I’ll be fine, clinging to a fragile hope. He also blames himself for listening to the old men who gave him the faulty directions. And with this also came profound doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, “it didn’t really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,"" a thought showing how mentally he couldn’t make it, his spirit nearly broken by the oppressive setting."
945	6925	3	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such harsh day settings, he started to desperately need water as he was running out, so his whole adventure narrowed to the singular goal of finding water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going, as he was so tired and his body was weakening. It made the journey harder on him, testing his physical limits. But it also, in a way, got him more strength and belief in himself, forcing him to dig deep and keep on pushing through the adversity. This internal resolve became his key asset, allowing him to persevere until he found the relief he so urgently needed.
946	6926	3	3	“Do not Exceed the posted speed limit” tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California, encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way. The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm and at peace. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again with fresh energy. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry seriously about his dwindling water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, the challenging rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is deeply disappointed when he sees the “town” he hoped to find is merely an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the oppressive heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his last reserves of strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, where he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather and terrain coincide and affect the cyclist’s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.
947	6927	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story states, ""I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth."" This quote explains that the setting was very dry and had pebbles scattered about. The setting ended up benefiting him by taking the thirst off his mind for a short while. If there weren't any pebbles near the cyclist he would not have made it through that difficult stretch. The pebbles helped him produce saliva, which provided a temporary relief from his desperate thirst. In conclusion, in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist was ultimately benefited by the features of the setting."
948	6928	3	3	The features of the setting affect any cyclist over a long period because if a cyclist passed much time on the bicycle, they could develop problems with their back later in life. When they become an older person and they have passed many years on the bicycle, they will likely have serious physical problems and also they will not be able to walk very well anymore. The constant strain and posture required for cycling can lead to chronic pain and mobility issues. This shows how the physical demands of the setting and activity can have lasting consequences. In conclusion, the physical features of cycling can negatively impact a person’s health in their later years.
949	6929	3	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit” affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the intense heat. At first he didn't really notice it much but then it began to slow him down significantly. Then the nature of the roads began to affect his ride, as the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills which were more difficult to pedal across. The road change and the accumulating heat made him say “I could drop from heatstroke,” showing his growing desperation. Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get any drinkable water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality and not safe to drink. These environmental challenges tested his endurance throughout the journey.
950	6930	3	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses toward Yosemite. After taking directions from the “old codgers,” the author attempts the shortcut, but is quickly disappointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted and offers no respite. He rubbed it off though, and kept “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” as his primary motivation to continue. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water; when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued his journey parched. Just as if things couldn’t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was critically low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope of finishing. He became even more of a pessimist when “a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement…” creating a dangerous obstacle. He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned and useless. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration by stimulating saliva. When he finally found the fish camp, he was profoundly relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth it in the end, as he achieved his goal.
951	6931	3	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particularly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat, a relentless force in the California deserts on a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be beating down particularly harder than it would at another place anytime, baking the asphalt. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line, but constantly pedaling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water supply deteriorated as did his state of mind, as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more morbid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature, a battle where the environment itself was his greatest adversary.
952	6932	3	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph through a vast, arid landscape. The intense, dry heat made his dehydration situation much worse, sapping his strength with every rotation of the wheels. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water, pushing forward against the oppressive conditions. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place in a cooler, shaded location, it would not have made sense for the central conflict. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation, creating a palpable sense of danger and urgency that defines the cyclist's ordeal."
953	6933	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn’t know where she was and on top of that got lost, her sense of direction failing her. Whether you see nothing around you or a lot around you, you’re going to feel scared; isolation and overwhelming stimuli can have the same alarming effect. In the author's case, she was cycling and didn’t have any water, a terrifying reality. This is an overwhelming feeling because you can die from dehydration, a fact that preys on your thoughts. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. “no one in sight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is alarming—no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They definitely affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her own. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle, tools that felt useless in the face of such emptiness.
954	6934	3	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much, shaping his entire unfortunate experience. Because he took a shortcut, he ended up with an even longer and more arduous journey than before. He was in the middle of nowhere with barely any water left, and on top of all that he’s exhausted from all the hills on the terrain, his muscles burning with the effort. So because he took a shortcut it ended up costing him in the long run, turning a simple ride into a desperate struggle for survival against the elements and his own poor judgment.
955	6935	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected the cyclist because first of all he listened to old folks that haven’t left their front porch in about ten years, relying on their outdated advice. Then he didn’t ask someone else’s opinion on where to go and how to get there, failing to seek a second perspective. His worst mistake though was not trusting the map he had with him the whole time, a reliable guide he foolishly ignored. If he would have just trusted his map and not went with what the old fella said, he wouldn’t have almost died of heat stroke, a direct consequence of his misplaced trust in the unfamiliar setting.
956	6936	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like in this quote, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing, a moment of profound disappointment that deepens his distress. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going to get to where he was going, but in the end, he got there and he got some water, a resolution that came only after enduring the harsh and unforgiving landscape.
957	6937	3	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main character is biking through a desert in the summer with little water, a journey that becomes increasingly perilous. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will surely die, a fear that haunts his every pedal stroke. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main character's energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main character's biggest problem is the oppressive and dangerous heat of the setting.
958	6938	3	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the word town in parentheses because it was actually a ghost town; no one lived there, it was completely abandoned. Around the cyclist was desert, and more empty towns, creating a landscape of isolation and false hope. The farther the cyclist got, the more he realized the old men were wrong as he was running low on water and there was nowhere to stop, a dire situation born from misguided advice. He finally found some water and vowed to never listen to old men's directions again, a hard-learned lesson about the treachery of the environment.
959	6939	3	3	All the features of the area have a big effect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles through an unforgiving landscape. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted, leaving him without hope for replenishment. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strength, his physical condition deteriorating with each passing mile. It seems like he might have collapsed if he hadn't thought he was going to make it, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store just in time. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of testing his very limits for survival.
960	6940	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road: Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way. It begins slowly with the “ghost town.” The narrator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” he wasn’t especially worried, but the fact he checked his water suggests that he’ll need to ration it for a while, an early sign of the challenges ahead. The decline continues when he reaches the fork and the “ramshackle shed.” The description of the place shows you he did not like it, and he confirms that with the words, “this sight was troubling.” He wouldn’t be replenishing his water here, another hope dashed. Any more of this and he’d be dead, either from dehydration or from pessimism. Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea. This is ironic, as he was only going 12 mph; to put it in his own words, “sometimes life can be so cruel.” He quite obviously hates the setting, and his entire difficult experience is a direct result of the hostile environment through which he travels.
961	6941	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn't bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer, more established route. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder, which drained his energy more quickly. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from the strenuous peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot; with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated from the combined effects of the sun and his exertion. This is how the specific features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout his journey.
962	6942	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit from the intense solar exposure. They don't come out and say it explicitly, but they do say, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” We all know that if you're outside when it's hot, you get hot too, and this would have been directly felt by the cyclist. It also probably added to his dehydration as the heat increased his sweating. As a long distance runner, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day, sapping your strength and fluids. That is how the setting, particularly the relentless sun, affected the cyclist and his physical state.
963	6943	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way, defining the very challenges he encounters. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems with isolation and difficult terrain. By changing any of the features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave and what resources he would need. Thus changing the entire plot of the story and the nature of his struggle. If the cyclist was say in a city or a merely developed area then he would not face the same dangers, like dehydration and exhaustion, as if he were in a remote, mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist, ultimately shaping his entire experience.
964	6944	3	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist, creating a series of escalating difficulties. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next stretch of miles easily. For example the cyclist says “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” and the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aren't going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist as the hills grew and his water diminished. Later on the cyclist ends up saying “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his intense fear of dehydration and the severity of his situation. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you, both physically and mentally.
965	6945	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening that complicate his journey. His water supply got drank quickly in the heat and he couldn't find a town near to replenish it. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him relentlessly. When he did find one town, it was more of a “ghost town”, and had rusted pumps that yielded only a battery-oil tasting liquid, which was undrinkable. Every person he asked told him the next town was near, but from dehydration and fatigue, it took him longer to reach than anticipated. The roads got windy and small hills occurred, slowing his progress further. There was a large snake in the middle of the road, as tumble weeds blew by, adding to the sense of a harsh environment. He finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get fresh water and cool down, ending his ordeal.
966	6946	3	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This change in terrain meant the cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired and expending greater energy. The speaker states, “I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a ‘heatstroke’ which could slow him down and pose a serious health risk. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside that his water became undrinkably warm, which affected him in that he was dehydrated and his performance suffered. Many aspects of the setting, from the topography to the extreme heat, significantly affected the cyclist's journey."
967	6947	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didn't give the boy advice then he probably wouldn't have run into all the trouble he ran into, leading him down an unfamiliar and difficult path. At the same time, the boy made his way to where he was going, demonstrating resilience despite the challenging circumstances. Next time though he will just use his map so he doesn't have to go through the scare of death again, learning a valuable lesson about self-reliance from his environmental experience. This shows how the setting, through the people and paths within it, directly shaped the cyclist's ordeal and his subsequent resolution.
968	6948	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road’s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road. This increasing roughness makes the journey more physically demanding and difficult to traverse, requiring greater effort and concentration from the rider. The deteriorating path forces the cyclist to adapt his pace and technique to navigate the challenging terrain safely. Consequently, the setting's physical characteristics have a direct and cumulative impact on the cyclist's experience and endurance throughout his ride.
969	6949	3	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot and the environment is harsh. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip, underestimating the demands of the landscape. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water and found his supply insufficient. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water, leaving him completely isolated. He came to a “run-down” rusty faucet and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid, offering no relief. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense, as the conflict is built upon the desert's unforgiving nature. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water, completely altering the narrative's tension. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story, fundamentally driving the protagonist's challenges and the plot's development.
970	6950	3	3	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks, and everything close to his path present constant hazards. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, for example like snakes, rough terrain, or rocks in the way, all of which can cause injury or delay. That is why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves when planning a route through such an environment. That is why when you see cyclists you see them around a road where there's cars around, just in case they get into trouble and need assistance, highlighting how the setting dictates their necessary precautions for a safe journey.
971	6951	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they give the journey more life and meaning, making the narrative more engaging and fun to read. A well-described environment adds depth to the experience, allowing the reader to visualize the path and feel the challenges and triumphs alongside the rider. This connection to the setting ultimately enriches the entire story, making the cyclist's adventure more vivid and compelling for the audience.
972	6952	3	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it’s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she doesn't want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, which a cyclist would certainly want to avoid. The harsh environment presents constant physical challenges that require significant endurance. When you're a cyclist times can be hard, so it is essential to be just prepared for the long run and its many potential hardships.
973	6953	3	3	The setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really goes against the cyclist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on the page it says, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn’t cool down.” This quote explains how bad the water was when the cyclist was there, highlighting the hostile and unforgiving nature of the landscape that actively hinders his progress and well-being.
974	6954	3	3	During this essay the author is talking about his journey, detailing the various challenges and observations he encounters along the way. He reflects on the changing landscape and how it influences his physical state and his morale. Through his descriptions, the reader gains insight into the demands of such a long-distance ride. The narrative serves as a personal account of perseverance, ultimately conveying the profound experience of traveling through diverse and demanding environments on a bicycle.
975	6955	3	3	The features of the setting included nice cool pines and then a ghost town and it being hot out and banners and poisonous snacks and hills that were getting harder to go up. When he first started the pines were nice and cool but when he scanned the ghost town he got disheartened. Then it started to get hot and he saw the snack and thought that it was a dimmed baby and was nervous, and then he was scared of dehydration. Finally, the hills started to make it harder and harder to pedal, illustrating the cumulative difficulties presented by the setting throughout his ride.
976	6956	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up steep hills and through rocky, uneven terrain. This increased physical exertion caused him to sweat more and his body to work harder. Therefore he drank more water to stay hydrated. When he couldn't find a refill for his bottle, his situation became increasingly difficult and his progress slowed considerably, highlighting the direct impact of the environment on his journey.
977	6957	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain and requires greater effort. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty and dehydrated. He was ""travelling through the high deserts of California in June."" This is a very hot time of year, and when a person gets lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person gets extremely thirsty. Not to mention the ""sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,"" which would remind the body of its thirst and taunt him with what he lacked. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist, shaping his physical state and his entire experience."
978	6958	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has nothing for miles. Just ghost towns, which makes it impossible to find any water or help. Also it’s a desert-like setting, adding to his thirst with its dry, arid air. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty from the exertion of climbing them. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he came to had no water because they seemed deserted and abandoned. Another example is the state he put under his tongue, a small stone. It’s a trick that lets you survive a lot more effectively by stimulating saliva. Therefore the settings affected his journey profoundly and made him wish he didn’t take the old man's advice, leaving him in a dire situation.
979	6959	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was tired and dehydrated he/she didn’t have anything to drink. The essay stated how he/she would say she/he would save the water til the end, but it was not enough. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her, slowing him down. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also, primarily being lost. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time, unable to find a correct path. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist, making the ride more strenuous. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions, all combining to create a challenging ordeal.
980	6960	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, “I could drop from heatstroke”. Meaning, its really hot and the extreme temperature is a genuine threat! Also, I think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. This has a big affect on him, because he’s very thirsty and his physical coordination is suffering. Also, I think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him, increasing his sense of isolation. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars or people to offer assistance. I think all these things affect him, creating a cumulative and overwhelming challenge for his journey.
981	6961	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting profoundly affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He finds himself on an empty road, flat and dry, under the oppressive June sun of California's high deserts. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, having been hitting his water bottles pretty regularly, and desperately needing to stop for some more. He stopped to get more water from an old pump, but once, all that came out was some tar-like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a while. The flat road was soon replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit.” He passed tumbleweeds and a large, menacing snake, all of which impacted his journey with fear and caution. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot and the landscape was empty, he was more thirsty, and therefore the setting directly affected the cyclist's physical and mental state."
982	6962	3	3	He feels profoundly alone; there is no one around him to push him, and yet he keeps going, trying to push himself to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and unforgiving, and the hills are tall and demanding, but he is a determined individual, steadfast in his resolve to finish the arduous journey he has undertaken, proving his endurance to himself.
983	6963	3	3	Heat, abandoned roads, and snakes are all reasons that affected the cyclist. The intense heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy pedaling through the desert. The long, abandoned roads further increased his doubt of surviving the whole bike ride, amplifying his sense of isolation. He used up all of his water, so when he got to the old pump, only hot, dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly, introducing a real physical danger. This all happened because he listened to the old guys, a decision he clearly came to regret. When another old guy was about to tell him where to go, he wisely said no, having learned a difficult lesson about trusting such advice.
984	6964	3	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert, as indicated in the quote “through high deserts of California.” This means that it was extremely hot and he was at risk of passing out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn’t even get any clean water. The quote about “the rusted water pump” describes how old and decrepit it was; the cyclist got some water out but it tasted like old battery acid, making it undrinkable. Therefore, the harsh features and setting directly affected the cyclist by threatening his health and impeding his progress.
985	6965	3	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over a period of time. Destined to reach Yosemite National Park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, his energy began depleting because the sun began to rise, bringing intense heat into the picture. Next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted. With what he believed to be his last burst of energy, he maneuvered down the hill. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him, draining his final reserves. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with fresh water, he became reloaded and replenished, regaining the confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile,” completing his transformative journey.
986	6966	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, shaping his journey and his state of mind. For example, he was riding in the desert, a vast and empty landscape, and all the towns he was going to were abandoned, which increased his sense of isolation. The month was June, a notoriously hot month, and the sun was beating down on him relentlessly. And he was cycling with very little water, a situation that made the harsh environment even more threatening and dire for his survival. This combination of factors created a profound physical and psychological challenge that defined his entire experience.
987	6967	3	3	"In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,” the setting effects the cyclist in many ways, directly influencing his emotions and resolve. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town, a place of eerie silence and decay. This effected the cyclist because he started to have serious doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered, clinging to that hopeful destination. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last, offering no respite. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldnít hold in the lamest mule,"" a description that underscored the complete desolation. This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water, his anxiety growing with each empty landmark. The next place was also similar, deepening his despair. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1, another sign of a place that had not survived the harsh environment. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted, leaving him feeling utterly alone and hopeless. Then, finally, the setting changed, offering a miraculous turn of events. There was a store that was actually opened, a beacon of life and civilization. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved, his fears immediately washed away by this simple sign of human presence. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist, each one dictating his emotional state from doubt to fear to ultimate relief."
988	6968	3	3	The authorís setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding, creating a formidable challenge for the cyclist. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist, a time when temperatures begin to soar. The author also noted that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down, intensifying its glare. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger, compounding the physical strain. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention, a critical problem for a long-distance rider. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclistís location, which provided context for the severity of the conditions. He was traveling through the high deserts of California, a region known for its arid climate. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since heís traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high, creating a perfect storm of environmental hardship. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills, introducing a new type of physical obstacle. Hills take a bigger toll on a personís body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill, demanding greater strength and endurance from the already fatigued cyclist. The combination of heat and difficult geography thus presented a relentless test of his limits.
989	6969	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly, testing his physical and mental fortitude at every turn. From the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him, a series of obstacles in a desolate landscape. A misleading challenge, but a challenge nonetheless. In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself, employing various tactics to maintain his will. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water, he used every mental trick to manage his thirst and despair. And when he arrive at the bait shop, his perseverance was finally rewarded. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven, a sanctuary in the wilderness. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again, having learned a hard lesson about trusting such advice. Luck was not a factor in this story; his survival was not a matter of chance. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story that determined the outcome. When it was two-hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light, relying on sheer determination. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it, his spirit refusing to be broken by the harsh setting. His journey was ultimately a testament to human resilience in the face of environmental adversity.
990	6970	3	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park, a goal that motivated his entire arduous journey. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut, a decision he would soon come to regret. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions, as the new path led him into severe hardship. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, a time and place known for extreme heat. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert, the conditions rapidly depleting his resources and energy. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid,” a vivid description that shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel, and what little he might have found was undrinkable. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” a statement that shows that he had no energy left, pushing his body to its absolute limit in the unforgiving landscape. His experience underscores how the physical setting directly created a life-threatening situation that tested his endurance to the brink.
991	6971	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. He writes, “I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling hills” (Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. The physical challenge of the landscape is compounded by his dwindling resources. Furthermore, he observes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to assist him. The isolation of the setting intensified his predicament, leaving him entirely reliant on his own dwindling strength. This is how the setting features affected the cyclist, creating a situation of escalating difficulty through both terrain and solitude.
992	6972	3	3	Almost all the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is, describing his physical state in detail. He notes, “The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.” These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweaty and hes been drinking so much, highlighting the direct impact of the climate. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town, creating a psychological barrier. He states, “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could make it test for.” He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it, a mental strategy forced upon him by the relentless, repetitive landscape. Thus, both the heat and the topography work in tandem to challenge him physically and mentally.
993	6973	3	3	The setting is described by the author as very challenging for three reasons: distance, water, and the heat. All of these only served to multiply the effects of the others, creating a compounded hardship for the rider. As time had went on, the cyclist grew increasingly tired from the relentless heat, which sapped his energy. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist, who conveyed a sense of being physically drained and overwhelmed by the environmental conditions. The great distance he had to cover seemed even farther without a reliable water source to combat the scorching temperature. Ultimately, these interconnected elements of the setting formed a triad of adversity that tested the cyclist's endurance to its limits, demonstrating how environmental factors can converge to create a singularly difficult experience.
994	6974	3	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways, primarily influencing his emotional state. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral”. I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry; he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in. Already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, feeling daunted by the official warning. Finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again, a sign of life and potential aid. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist, whose spirits were directly shaped by the landscape and signs he encountered."
995	6975	3	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him, with the narrative focusing on the latter. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water deprivation can lead to dehydration, posing a serious physical threat. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused, as the constant ascents and descents demanded more effort. The absence of services and the more demanding terrain worked together to increase the journey's difficulty. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist, demonstrating how environmental factors directly influence both the physical challenge and the mental focus required to continue."
996	6976	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the pass is on a road with a lot of hills, which would affect him by making him tired. Furthermore, if the biker was in a place with extreme cold or hot weather, it would affect him by altering his body temperature and, consequently, by impacting his overall attitude and mental state during the ride. These environmental factors combine to significantly influence the cyclist's physical condition and his frame of mind on the journey.
997	6977	3	3	The settings in this article affect the cyclist by forcing him to bike a lot of miles to get to the next town. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it is very hot out, which increases his risk of dehydration. There is nothing in sight for miles and miles, meaning he has no access to shelter or supplies, intensifying his isolation and physical strain. This harsh environment creates a challenging and potentially dangerous situation for the lone traveler.
998	6978	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in that he showed the map to other people and he shouldn't listen to others about where he had to go. This suggests the environment included other individuals who offered advice or directions that were not necessarily helpful or correct. The cyclist's journey was thus impacted by social interactions within the setting, leading him to rely on his own judgment. Ultimately, the setting's social dimension presented a challenge that the cyclist had to navigate independently.
999	6979	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many features of the setting affected the cyclist, and these setting features could be easily found in the middle part of the essay. These settings caused the cyclist to become exhausted on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a road change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills, which caused him to lose a certain amount of energy. Then, his lack of water caused him to become dehydrated. He could lose another large amount of energy by this, and out of this stage, he mostly needed someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. This isolation might cause his emotional state to break down, further contributing to his energy loss. Overall, the cyclist suffered a significant loss of energy on his journey and was unable to have a supporter to help him through these difficult conditions.
1000	6980	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can serve as guides and points of reference along a journey, helping the cyclist to navigate and understand his progress. These features of the environment are therefore crucial for orientation and maintaining a sense of direction.
1001	6981	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black rattlesnake, a dangerous creature, but he manages to pass it easily and moves on without incident. Being in the intense heat and with no water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because of the old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office. These guys gave him wrong directions, leading him astray onto this difficult path. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn’t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him, ultimately teaching him a valuable lesson about self-reliance.
1002	6982	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town with its dusty, silent streets, but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men who sent him this way. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business, a sign of active life. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water and be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of life or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved, showing how the landscape directly shapes his emotional state.
1003	6983	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads. The constant bumps and ruts demand greater physical exertion, draining his stamina more quickly. Also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator, leaving him dehydrated and fatigued as he presses onward through the challenging terrain.
1004	6984	3	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads. Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from many miles the have to bring plenty of food and water to sustain their energy. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate, with tires properly inflated and the chain well-oiled. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on before the trip begins. Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time without excessive fatigue. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint for a successful and safe journey.
1005	6985	3	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did, such as finding shade or conserving his energy, which became crucial for his endurance. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters, as it presents challenges that directly test a rider's preparedness and resolve.
1006	6986	3	3	The setting in the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit” greatly affects the cyclist, testing his physical endurance and mental fortitude. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined, pushing him to his absolute limits. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, “Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can’t think clearly, his vision blurring and his mind clouded with exhaustion. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him, the vast emptiness offering no respite from the oppressive heat. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist, fundamentally shaping his arduous journey.
1007	6987	3	3	The cyclist was profoundly affected by long hours of riding the bike into the remote and unfamiliar areas where he had never been before. The isolation of the landscape compounded his physical fatigue, leaving him entirely reliant on his own dwindling resources. Each turn in the road revealed more desolate scenery, which weighed heavily on his spirit and heightened his sense of vulnerability. This challenging journey through unknown territory pushed him to confront his own limits in a harsh and unyielding environment. Ultimately, the unfamiliar and demanding setting was a central factor in his difficult experience.
1008	6988	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected by the setting mentally and physically, with each element of the environment contributing to his ordeal. For example, the setting affected the cyclist mentally because it all was desert and sand with no water, a barren vista that offered no hope of immediate relief. He thought he was going to die, he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” a vivid expression of his deep despair. If he had some water he would not have thought this, as his physical need directly fueled his mental state. Also the cyclist was affected physically because the road was rough and it looked as it could go on forever, each bump and incline sapping his strength. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him, his body pushed to the brink of collapse. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don’t think he would have felt this way, the contrast highlighting the setting's specific cruelty. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting physically and mentally; if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way, proving the environment's powerful role.
1009	6989	3	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition in significant ways. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. This sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry that he would not find the supplies he desperately needed. He was running out of water, a critical situation made worse as “The sun was beginning to beat down” with increasing intensity, and he was probably tired of pedaling for hours without a clear destination. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills that demanded even more from his weary body. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up, his energy reserves nearly depleted. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted by the sight of civilization, and he was able to get water to cool him down and replenish his strength. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip to Yosemite park, demonstrating how a positive change in setting could immediately reverse his declining condition."
1010	6990	3	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such an empty terrain that made him rely on only himself because of the complete lack of others to help. The vast, silent desert stretched out in all directions, offering no signs of life or assistance. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where, simple comforts that were entirely absent from his current reality. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strength to go on and get to safety, forcing a profound internal struggle against the elements. The isolation was absolute, making his personal resilience the sole determinant of his fate. In this way, the harsh setting was the primary antagonist of his journey.
1011	6991	3	3	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip, causing a significant delay and mental distress. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on, demonstrating resilience in the face of an unexpected obstacle. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad, leading to severe physical consequences. As stated “I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June…” This highlights the real danger posed by the environment. There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey, each presenting a unique challenge to be overcome.
1012	6992	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are several features that effect the cyclist. “..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly, sapping his energy and increasing his physical discomfort. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist, demanding greater physical exertion and altering the pace of his travel. These conditions directly affect the cyclist, shaping his experience and testing his endurance throughout the journey.
1013	6993	3	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, a destination that required a long and arduous journey. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June, a time of year when the heat was intense and unrelenting. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony, leaving him in a state of severe thirst and vulnerability. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water, which added to his desperation and highlighted the unforgiving nature of the landscape. That is how the setting affected him, creating a series of physical hardships that directly challenged his ability to complete his trip.
1014	6994	3	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the high deserts of California”. This constant need for water illustrates the physical toll of the environment. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.” This mirage, a trick of the mind induced by heat and exhaustion, shows how the harsh conditions were beginning to affect his perception and mental state, making the journey even more challenging.
1015	6995	3	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling and maintain his physical strength. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going, ensuring he stays on the correct path. From not enough water he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph” That site ment that the old manís sense of directin was out of date, proving unreliable for navigation. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch, which left the cyclist without the crucial guidance he needed to navigate the difficult terrain effectively.
1016	6996	3	3	The features of the setting are that it is hot and dry, creating a harsh environment for the journey. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water, leaving him with only about @NUM1 sips remaining when he finally gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had one key advantage on his side. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up, so then he had a brief time to get cool before the intense heat of the day set in. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets to the top of some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind, which offers a momentary relief. Also when the cyclist was desperately thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth to stimulate saliva. These environmental factors collectively shape his difficult experience on the road.
1017	6997	3	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist’s mood and energy, directly influencing his physical state and mental outlook. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic, feeling a sense of effortless progress. However, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease.” The cyclist in the story was hot, exhausted, and dangerously dehydrated. He thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” a grim reflection of his despair. Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself, proving that the landscape is a powerful force in any journey.
1018	6998	3	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to Rosemite, pushing forward despite the significant challenge he faced. He had a severe lack of water, a critical problem in the arid environment, but he went on anyway, driven by his determination to reach his destination. During his arduous trek, he had to go past a snake coiled on the path and got scared, a moment of sudden alarm that broke his rhythm. This encounter with the wildlife, combined with his physical strain, tested his resolve as he continued his journey through the demanding terrain.
1019	6999	3	3	All the features of the settings affect his rhythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. The various distractions and hardships of the environment, like the heat and the difficult terrain, can disrupt his focus and mental stamina. Instead of thinking about it and letting the negative conditions overwhelm him, he should maintain a stronger mental approach. If I was him I would just ride my bike and think about one thing: winning! This singular focus would help him push through the adversity and stay committed to his ultimate objective.
1020	7000	3	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair, acting as the ultimate determinant of success. The cyclist was given very old directions, which led him onto a challenging and unforgiving route. He was given back roads that are abandoned now, paths that offered little assistance. These towns had no people in them; normally that would not matter, but he “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1), a time of extreme heat. If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer, a truly grueling endeavor. A “ghost town” with no good water could have killed him, highlighting the life-or-death stakes. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them, as failure to do so can have severe consequences.
1021	7001	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the “ghost town” he felt alone and discouraged, surrounded by empty, silent buildings that offered no refuge. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was, amplifying his physical discomfort. Overall I think that it had really physical and psychological effects on him, draining his spirit as much as his body.
1022	7002	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles across a demanding landscape. “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.” This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated, a combination that tested his resolve. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration, a desperate attempt to manage his suffering. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well, demonstrating his resilience in the face of adversity.
1023	7003	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town” which offered no relief. It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasnít helping either, adding to his exhaustion. The terrain really affected the energy he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey “a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the pavement” which posed a direct threat to his safety. The features of the setting definitely affected the cyclist in many challenging ways.
1024	7004	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated, bearing down on him without reprieve. For instance, the weather was sunny in June, creating an oppressive and relentless environment. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired, demanding constant physical exertion. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing, his muscles straining with every incline. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist, leaving him isolated and without support. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink, which intensified his struggle. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way, creating a journey defined by hardship and endurance.
1025	7005	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly becoming dehydrated, with the sun draining his energy and moisture. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair, presenting a landscape devoid of life or aid. This desolate environment contributes to a feeling of isolation and difficulty, as there are no resources available to assist him on his arduous journey. The combined effect of the heat and the crumbling structures creates a significant challenge for the cyclist's progress and well-being.
1026	7006	3	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the California desert on a hot day in June, which causes the cyclist to drink all of his water, which later makes him dehydrated. The barren desert, with its vast expanse and no distinct landmarks, causes the cyclist to become lost, which is the main problem he faces. The relentless sun and the monotonous terrain offer no respite, compounding his dire situation as he struggles to find his way. Ultimately, the unforgiving environment proves to be the central antagonist in his journey.
1027	7007	3	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by normal standards, where it gets to a high temperature, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at a very warm temperature. By noon, it's past extremely hot. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" He makes note that he’s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips."" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he’d be okay, but he regretted it later on when the intense, dry heat continued to bear down on him. The setting, therefore, directly orchestrated the central conflict of his narrative."
1028	7008	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around, leaving her completely isolated. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try to forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were “I was going to die.” First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp, a sight that brought immense relief. Her setting was very clear until then, a vast and empty landscape that suddenly gave way to hope. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive, saved from the harsh environment.
1029	7009	3	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He’s biking, in California, in the desert. It’s not a mild climate and the sun is probably scorching, beating down without mercy. The heat plus all the biking he’s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired, creating a vicious cycle of physical depletion. The arid air saps the moisture from his body with every labored breath, and the shimmering heat haze on the horizon disorients him further. In this way, the hostile setting actively exacerbates his already critical condition.
1030	7010	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the “high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist also saw a “ridiculously large snake,” a sign of the wild and untamed land. There was also “no signs of civilization for miles.” There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, just an endless, empty landscape. The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite, each challenge shaped by the environment. I think the settings affected the cyclist in many ways, from the physical hardship of the heat to the psychological toll of the profound isolation, ultimately defining the entire journey.
1031	7011	3	3	The features of the setting affect cyclists greatly, presenting challenges that can make or break a journey. Elements like the relentless weather, difficult terrain, high temperature, and thin air at altitude test a rider's limits. In this essay, the intense heat and the endless hills on the road challenge the cyclist profoundly. He just keeps going through the adversity, pushing past each obstacle, and eventually he gets to civilization, where the harsh environment recedes. This hard-won arrival lets you know that you can’t let mother nature control you, but must persevere against its forces.
1032	7012	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist, imposing a severe physical toll during the journey. The author is getting worn out by the conditions and is rapidly running out of his vital water supply. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, a time of year known for its extreme and unforgiving dryness. This specific setting, with its vast, arid landscape and scorching sun, is causing him to become greatly exhausted, sapping his energy with every mile.
1033	7013	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously, directly challenging his initial confidence. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles without issue until he passed through the flat ground, which was then replaced by short rolling hills. The change in topography immediately introduced a new level of difficulty. He said, and I quoted, “I toiled on,” and he sounds like it’s hopeless, as if he wasn’t going to make it after all. As you can see, the setting does effect the cyclist, dictating his morale and physical capacity.
1034	7014	3	3	The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was the very hot, arid deserts, a place of stark isolation. On a bike ride through such an environment, there are not many places to stop for food or water, making preparation critical. On a bike ride you can't bring a lot of luggage with you, only the most important materials and a big enough jug of water to sustain you. An example from the text shows how desperate it was out there: “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength.” He was so thirsty and tired he didn’t know how else to get some water, revealing the sheer desperation induced by the setting.
1035	7015	3	3	"In the setting, the young man is faced by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person, forging his character through adversity. For example, he was proud of himself at the journey's end; he made himself happy by saying, ""yes sir! I own a very good map."" This statement reflects his triumph and acquired wisdom. He knows that he got through the oppressive heat, the dry air, the potential snakes, and a low supply of water to get to where he was determined to be, which was Yosemite, proving his resilience."
1036	7016	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it’s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he’s lost in a ghost town. The arid landscape and the intense summer heat exacerbate his desperate need for hydration. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed, creating a significant challenge for the protagonist during his journey."
1037	7017	3	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good ""it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1"". I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I’m going to explain my examples. He looks hoppy becaus in the story he said ""the morning with strong legs and smile on my face."" the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. He also seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. Finally, the way he is becasse he soid ""As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me"" the part made me feel that he was experiencing a moment of great personal triumph and satisfaction."
1038	7018	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes ""that road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road, making his journey more physically demanding. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels ""life can feel so cruel"" (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do, which is to ride freely and quickly. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist by creating both physical and mental obstacles for him."
1039	7019	3	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident, feeling prepared for his journey ahead. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated by the desolate environment. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad, as his hope for aid was dashed. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived to have found a source of help. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip, directly influencing his emotional state.
1040	7020	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"", there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, ""The sun was beginning to beat down"", the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June"", California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated, demonstrating the powerful impact of his environment."
1041	7021	3	3	In the short story “Rough road ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist faced many difficulties. These difficulties were the direct result of the harsh setting. The story takes place in “the high deserts of California in June.” Because the month of June is very warm, and the climate of that region is typically hot and dry, the cyclist quickly ran into problems. Not only did this affect the cyclist physically, but he was also travelling through a vast and unforgiving desert landscape. The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way, which significantly contributed to the problem. The cyclist soon ran out of water, and to his dismay, discovered the towns that lay before him were completely unoccupied and offered no respite. He had no choice but to continue with his arduous journey through the desolate terrain.
1042	7022	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One primary way is that the hilly terrain makes him work harder and consequently wears him out more quickly. Since the cyclist is getting worn out from the constant exertion, he needs to drink more and more water to stay hydrated. Now that he’s drinking more water, he is running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it, creating a vicious cycle. Then, when he starts to use less water in an attempt to conserve it until he gets to the next town, he begins to become dehydrated and even more tired, and he starts to feel progressively weaker. Also, because the terrain is consistently hilly, his legs are working much harder to go up the steep inclines and his legs become sore and tired. Furthermore, as the day progresses, it also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the various elements of the setting collectively affect the cyclist.
1043	7023	3	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water, which immediately establishes a sense of scarcity. At one point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This detail makes the setting sound particularly dry and empty, with the added threat of a harmful snake around, increasing the feeling of danger. This man also mentioned a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” and this warning also made it hard for the man to ride smoothly and maintain his pace. These are the specific settings and details that affected the biker in the story and shaped his challenging experience.
1044	7024	3	3	The feature of it is the landscape, which establishes the physical world of the narrative. Another key feature is the characters, who drive the action and provide a human element. The plot is also a central feature, outlining the sequence of events and the conflicts that arise. Furthermore, the beginning of the story sets the stage and introduces the initial situation. Finally, the end of the narrative provides resolution and concludes the sequence of events. These components work together to form a complete literary work.
1045	7025	3	3	The setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes, the mood of the cyclist changes accordingly. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” At this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive and cheerful mood, refreshed by the pleasant surroundings. As the story goes on, the landscape shifts dramatically, and “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any kind.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate and lonely one as his water begins to run out and the isolation becomes overwhelming. The evolving setting directly dictates his emotional state throughout the journey.
1046	7026	3	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” makes the biker's travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use significantly more energy to pedal up the steep inclines. This made it hard on him to overcome his exhaustion and test his limits of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June,” and this weather is very hot and dry, therefore causing him to quickly run low on his precious water supply. And, because he was in the vast, empty desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type for many miles. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew with certainty that if he dropped from severe dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclusion, these hard and unforgiving conditions challenged the biker a great deal.
1047	7027	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert-like terrain that was harsh and uninviting. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles, sapping his strength. All the intense heat built up a powerful desire for him to get a cool drink of water. He had been very tired from the exertion. The terrain and climate had made him drenched in sweat, dehydrating him further. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t have had that much of a hard time on his journey. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure strenuous physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance level, the relentless heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy quickly. Also, it didn’t help anything, that the elderly men had given him terrible directions, leading him further into this difficult landscape. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist so profoundly.
1048	7028	3	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affects the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The fact that there was nothing around him, just empty isolation, made the author lose hope and trust in his situation. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt a surge of optimism like something was finally happening in his favor. Then he saw with dismay that it was completely abandoned and he lost all hope once more. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he’s going to die out there alone. He shows that he’s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from “old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the desolate setting caused him to doubt the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.
1049	7029	3	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning with promise. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the growing heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a foul liquid that resembles “battery acid,” which does nothing to help him. The terrain begins to feel like more of a constant hill, which makes the physical struggle even worse for his tired legs. The cyclist is drinking water more frequently now, and is becoming genuinely tired and weary. He comes to a rough road and says, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative effects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride; further on, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dangerously dehydrated. The cyclist feels a wave of refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is finally replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature of the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.
1050	7030	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him incredibly thirsty. “... followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. This is a quote that explains the intense, oppressive heat that the cyclist is feeling from the environment around him. The sun is another big feature that affects him, beating down relentlessly and contributing to his dehydration and fatigue. The combined effect of these harsh elements creates a formidable challenge for his journey. This is how the setting affects the cyclist throughout his arduous ride.
1051	7031	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectacular and amazing. He is searching for a place that matches a specific ideal in his mind. For example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got there and it was a ghost town; he chuckled and rode away because it wasn’t what he was looking for. I believe that this guy is judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it has to offer. It is like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old map, but yet he still took it, showing his conflicting nature. I believe that he wants to get where he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what. It's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he thinks when he finds it he will be filled with stories, a belief that drives his entire journey forward.
1052	7032	3	3	"The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways; if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty, his body straining under the sun's intensity. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty, his muscles burning with the effort of each ascent. The cyclist, although thirsty and tired, is determined to get through and find a town, a goal that keeps his legs pumping. The cyclist said, ""I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine."" By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as being determined to do so, using small victories to fuel his spirit. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, it would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity. He still keeps a strong spirit, and with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs from within himself."
1053	7033	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change throughout his arduous journey. In the first location, where it’s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good and his optimism is high. He’s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path, feeling invigorated by the pleasant surroundings. His spirits are still in a good mood when he comes to the first town, hoping for a respite. As he moves on, and his water supply depletes, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated, the physical lack mirroring his emotional state. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch’s Grape Juice factory, he is about to quit, the cruel juxtaposition pushing him to his limit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat, his resolve worn thin. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take water for granted or advice from old men ever again, a lesson hard-learned from the setting's tests.
1054	7034	3	3	"The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower, offering him no solace on his difficult trek. The things he sees discourage him, for example ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me."" This sight was troubling, a portrait of decay that sapped his hope. The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town; sometimes the things are psychologically damaging, eroding his mental fortitude. ""In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen."" For someone who is quickly running out of water, this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue, the taunting image a final mental blow. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy, while the heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist, presenting obstacle after obstacle to break his spirit completely."
1055	7035	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, each one presenting a new challenge to his journey. First the climate affected him the most; that is so because he became too hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated from the relentless sun. So he had no energy because of dehydration, his body weakening with every mile. Another one is the build of the road. That is so because it was rocky, bumpy, and winding, with hills that seemed to never end. With being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die, the physical strain becoming a mental battle. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him, creating an inescapable furnace that tested his every limit.
1056	7036	3	3	During the cyclist's trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, a bad water pump, an abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn't even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recovers the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused, finding a bleak humor in the desolation. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low, a growing anxiety in his chest. Then, what is originally a sign of hope becomes another let down. A water pump is found just in time, but the water is no longer any good, a trickle of rust-colored liquid that offers no relief. This determination they reach “rough roads” creating, once again, a more painful journey, jolting his tired body. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, it is deserted, a hollow shell offering no sanctuary. The only goodness for the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait “tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive, a small but vital token of a world not entirely forsaken. Hope after hope arises only to end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal for the reader. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more, turning each page with a sense of shared anticipation and dread.
1057	7037	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist profoundly because of the bad condition of the roads. The surfaces were cracked and uneven, littered with loose gravel that made steering precarious and demanded constant, strenuous effort. There were also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists, forcing them to stand on the pedals and strain against the relentless incline. This combination of treacherous footing and steep ascents drained the cyclist's energy reserves far more quickly than a journey on a smooth, flat path ever would, compounding the physical toll of the journey.
1058	7038	3	3	“There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. This profound loneliness makes it hard for the cyclist to foster hope and threes as where to get water, with his eyes scanning the empty horizon for any form of relief. “I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned. The sheer isolation amplifies his vulnerability, turning the vast, beautiful landscape into a prison of heat and silence where his own survival is the only question that remains.
1059	7039	3	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain, with its potholes and jagged rocks, made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster, sapping the strength from his legs with every rotation. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding, its relentless rays beating down upon his back and drawing precious moisture from his body with each passing mile. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition, a state where every movement became a conscious effort of will against the oppressive elements.
1060	7040	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” affect the cyclist significantly. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings with a mixture of awe and apprehension. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are not mild in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the pervasive and growing lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated, a constant threat on such a journey. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, the cyclist encounters a ridiculously large” snake in the middle of the rode, a sudden and startling danger that halts his progress. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling, from the environmental to the unexpected. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn't give up and is profoundly relieved when he finally receives water, a moment that underscores the harshness of the setting against the power of human resilience.
1061	7041	3	3	"The features of the desert profoundly changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began to change, the speaker's determination did too, as ""flat roads were replaced by short hills."" The increasingly difficult terrain made him doubtful of the old man who had directed him towards the supposed shortcut. He thought, “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades.” The oppressive heat in the desert made the speaker desperately thirsty, causing him to drink all of his water prematurely. With no visible source of water, he decided to suck on a stone, recalling, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst.” However, the bumpy terrain did not allow him to do this safely; he hit a bump and accidentally swallowed the stone. This incident caused the speaker to panic, thinking, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Luckily, his desperate thoughts changed after he fortunately found a supply of water, demonstrating how the desert's features affected the cyclist very much."
1062	7042	3	3	The desolate setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way. Due to the complete lack of buildings, people, and cars on his so-called “shortcut,” he was filled with great doubt about his survival. The overwhelming isolation intensified his fears, leading him to think, “I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.” He became convinced he wouldn't find any water because there was nothing around him, and he believed he would ultimately die of dehydration or the intense heat. This is captured in his “growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.” The barren landscape thus directly fueled his despair and sense of impending doom, leaving him feeling completely vulnerable and hopeless.
1063	7043	3	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many ways, primarily through the harsh environmental conditions. It was extremely hot when he was riding, which made him profoundly thirsty. For example, the text states, “The sun was beginning to heat down,” indicating the sun's exhausting and dehydrating effect. Another detail provided is that he was “traveling through the desert of California in June.” California is a relatively hot state, and June is one of its warmer months, which compounded the heat's intensity. Furthermore, the terrain itself did not favor the rider, as “flat roads had turned into short, rolling hills.” These short rolling hills are physically harder on a biker's body than flat terrain, demanding more energy and increasing fatigue. This combination of extreme heat and difficult terrain is how the setting profoundly affected the rider during his journey.
1064	7044	3	3	The setting significantly affected the cyclist primarily because the journey took place in June when the temperatures were starting to get dangerously hot. In the book, it specifies that he was going through the desert, an environment known for its harsh and unforgiving climate. The author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was relentlessly beaming down on him, leading to a severe risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion. These environmental factors created a life-threatening situation that directly impacted his physical state and his chances of survival on the journey.
1065	7045	3	3	In this paragraph, I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affects the cyclist in significant ways such as the extreme weather, the challenging road structure, and the presence of animals. These were all things that the cyclist could not control, yet they had a direct impact on his experience. The weather brought intense heat, the road structure introduced exhausting physical obstacles, and the animals posed a potential threat, thereby collectively affecting the cyclist while he rides through the landscape. These uncontrollable elements of the setting ultimately shaped the difficulty and the peril of his journey.
1066	7046	3	3	The features of the setting in this story give the cyclist determination. Since the desert landscape is vast and unforgiving, it demands immense physical and mental fortitude to traverse. The sheer scale of the empty horizon pushes the cyclist to find inner strength, forcing a resolve to continue despite the overwhelming environment. This harsh setting ultimately forges a powerful will to persevere and complete the journey, proving that adversity can build character.
1067	7047	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn't have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn't in a “ghost town,” with the “sun beginning to beat down.” It was in California during June so it was very hot; the water was also over a hundred degrees! The text states there were rolling hills and tumbleweeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the pedal,” causing him to be tired from the relentless effort. As you can see, the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot, which combined to create a profoundly challenging experience for the rider.
1068	7048	3	3	The features of the setting are very important for a cyclist. If the setting is wrong, they could be in many dangers, such as getting lost or facing extreme weather. It is really important to have a clear and safe setting to ensure a successful and secure journey. A well-chosen route with accessible resources and predictable conditions is fundamental for any cycling endeavor, highlighting how the environment directly influences the rider's safety and overall experience.
1069	7049	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worst problems and couldn't really do anything about them. Also, he started out fine, but then he started to become dehydrated rapidly. He didn't have much water left and he was only a few miles up the road. A loss of water was very effective in June traveling through a desert. Also, the damage of the road was very effective too because he's on a bike and doesn't have too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages, and snakes. The cyclist was on a bike and couldn't really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired, making him vulnerable to the harsh realities of his journey.
1070	7050	3	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration and heat exhaustion. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult and taxing. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy and stamina to ride up. There were even signs for “rough road ahead,” presenting another physical challenge. Another obstacle was a mental one. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he desperately needed an occupied building. These encounters were ironic and mentally frustrating. The cyclist must have lost hope in finding civilization after he found multiple abandoned examples of it. This profound discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging, adding a psychological weight to his physical ordeal.
1071	7051	3	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they’re water supply, which is essential for a long journey. They would want water even more after going up hills, as the physical exertion increases their thirst significantly. They would also want a place to get something to eat and maybe rest for a while to recover their energy. Such stops provide necessary relief from the continuous effort of cycling, making the route more manageable. Ultimately, the availability of these resources directly influences the cyclist's stamina and overall progress on the trip.
1072	7052	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of the intense heat and the fact that he had no water to drink. Also how rough the road ahead was created a difficult and exhausting path for him to travel. Another problem was the dry air, which parched his throat, and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert posed a constant danger. Also the hills were a big problem too because of the combined strain of the heat and having no water to replenish himself. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him, a thought that filled him with despair. This is how the harsh setting affected the cyclist throughout his ordeal.
1073	7053	3	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, as he states, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist is very hot and suffers from the relentless sun. He was thirsty but found that “A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo.” The water was barely even water, so he didn’t have much to drink until the next town, which prolonged his discomfort. He notes that “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills, which demand greater effort. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills, and his spirits were low. He saw “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen” on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envious of the young boy and his apparent refreshment. It also discourages him, highlighting his own lack. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change, the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exhausted from his journey.
1074	7054	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding, which boosts his morale. This means that he doesn’t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides many miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like, just to maintain basic hydration. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn’t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn’t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it for the difficult stretches. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn’t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate further, weakening him. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn’t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse, creating a cruel irony. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don’t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better, making his journey a struggle against the environment.
1075	7055	3	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill, which looms intimidatingly before him. Another is that as he is going up this big hill it's hot, there are snakes around, he's scared and tired from the relentless climb. Almost all of his energy is gone, drained by the steep incline and the harsh conditions. He just wants to stop and rest, yet he is determined to go up this hill and see it through to the top. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax all the way back down, a thought that provides a small comfort during the arduous ascent. This mixture of dread and determination defines his experience with the challenging terrain.
1076	7056	3	3	"After reading ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,"" I noticed that the setting of this adventure profoundly affected the narrator. First of all, the intense heat caused the narrator to be physically uncomfortable and significantly thirstier. While on the move, he refers to the trip as a ""water-depleting"" one; this quote clearly shows that he was critically lacking water and that this was a major problem for his survival. Also, it refers to the road as ""rolling hills,"" and this description shows the reader that the terrain seemed to go on forever without end. This endless landscape lowers the narrator’s hope of getting to his destination quickly, creating a sense of mental fatigue. Also, the vast, empty desert gives the author low hope of ever reaching his destination, amplifying his despair. The setting thus affects the narrator both physically, through dehydration and exhaustion, and mentally, by diminishing his morale and optimism."
1077	7057	3	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going precisely because he was all alone and had absolutely no help from anyone else. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high, as he had only his own will to rely on. If he would have had a partner, they could have stopped and took a break or shared the dwindling water supply, providing mutual support. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses, or anything in sight for miles deeply affected him. He got a sudden bolt of strength just from seeing a single building ahead in the distance, a rare sign of civilization. If there had been buildings consistently, he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested safely. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June, with its extreme heat, really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could actively do to better the situation in his cause, feeling utterly powerless. He even at one point felt with a chilling certainty that he might die from the ordeal. In conclusion, the setting really affected the cyclist because it fundamentally determined his level of endurance and his will power to continue.
1078	7058	3	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. For example, he asks the older guys, ""that haven't left their porches since Carter was in office,"" where the next place was to get water, highlighting his desperation and the isolated nature of the locals. Also, he was out in the middle of nowhere, with no immediate sources of aid or comfort. It was also in June where the weather was particularly warm, and he didn't have a lot of water, which compounded his physical struggles and heightened his thirst. These environmental factors collectively shaped his difficult and draining journey through the landscape."
1079	7059	3	3	"Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in the ""high desert of California in June."" This affected him in many ways, primarily through the extreme heat. It makes him become very dehydrated, a constant and pressing concern. He had to carefully conserve his limited water and even chew on pebbles just to get any spit to collect in his mouth for temporary relief. Also, the road became very rough and unforgiving. The new, difficult terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy much quicker than on a smooth path. The last significant feature would be the immense distance he had to cover. He had to travel a lot further then he had originally planned to, which was disheartening. This again affected his energy and spirits with dark thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it to safety. Those are how just some of the key features of the setting critically affected the cyclist throughout his arduous trip."
1080	7060	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere, he couldn’t get any water from any source, leaving him completely reliant on his own dwindling supplies. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,” he thought, showing he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy left to keep going and was resorting to desperate measures. “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” further illustrates the danger; it was extremely hot out and he had no water, so this affected his energy levels and his very will to continue, creating a life-threatening situation. These environmental challenges directly shaped his physical state and his mental resolve during the journey.
1081	7061	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist. The harsh, unforgiving terrain proved a significant challenge, especially when his water supply was critically low and all the towns he passed had been completely abandoned, leaving him with no opportunity for a refill. The oppressive heat was also a major factor, quickly creating a weary and tired state as he pedaled onward. On the bike ride, he had a glimmer of hope upon discovering an old water pump, but was quickly disappointed when the hot liquid that emerged tasted strongly of battery acid, making it undrinkable. Ultimately, the hostile setting established the central conflict and helped achieve the desperate, weary tone the author was looking for to truly affect the cyclist's journey.
1082	7062	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist primarily through the roughness of the ride. First, they might go over a bunch of sharp rocks and uneven ground, where a tire could easily pop or become damaged. Next, the path could sometimes be smooth and easy, offering a brief respite from the physical strain. Also, the route could be far away from any towns, making it difficult to get back to safety or find help. Furthermore, there could be a complete lack of available water sources, making you dehydrate quickly under the sun. That is how the various elements of the setting around the cyclist could significantly effect him during his journey.
1083	7063	3	3	The setting described in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a genuine nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a vast desert on a scorching summer’s day. The constant sweat dropping down his body is just speeding up his dangerous dehydration. This is clearly shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This quote powerfully shows how intensely hot the desert was, and how he genuinely feared he could drop dead. The desert is also completely deserted, marked only by rolling tumbleweeds and the threat of giant snakes, as he passed numerous abandoned towns and derelict factories. The overall dangerousness for a biker in this isolated area is very high, and the biker was ultimately lucky to have made it out of those harsh surroundings alive.
1084	7064	3	3	The arid desert area of California was aggressively making him dehydrated. The trip was long, but he initially had enough water to get him there, but only if he had strictly taken the map's prescribed way. The old men, who he thought “haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office,” told him about a tempting shortcut that he foolishly followed, and this decision ended up almost killing him due to severe heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have simply followed the original map, he could have safely stopped off at a store for more water even if the setting was that bad, thereby avoiding the life-threatening situation.
1085	7065	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many critical ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a bustling city, the perilous events in the story would have simply not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and, “like a foolish youth,” blindly followed their questionable advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town, where he was almost completely dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached an abandoned grape juice factory that offered no relief. Almost all hope was lost for him until he finally rounded a bend and came across his new hope: a sign for “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp—if you want bait for the big ones, we’re your best bet.” In the end, he learned a vital lesson to stick to a reliable map instead of relying on old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.”
1086	7066	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advice from people that no longer drive or even leave the porch would be useless. When the author refers to the “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” he is explaining how their perspective is outdated and irrelevant to his current journey. He then says, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” referring back to how he is on the road alone, riding the bike with not a car in sight anywhere around him. The curves of the turns were so sharp that only a bicycle could navigate them as safely as he did. When “he whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and tried not to get too excited,” it shows that in this situation, the long, lonely cycle by himself would have made many people excited, yet he maintained his focus and composure throughout the ride.
1087	7067	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to Yosemite National Park a longer, more difficult, and dangerous route to travel. He dismisses the awe of going that way expressed by some old folks that he says “haven’t gotten off their porches since Carter was in office.” I think that there would be a reason not to listen to them, though they may possess a certain kind of wisdom; their lack of recent experience means their advice is not practical for the challenges of the actual journey, which required current, firsthand knowledge of the terrain and conditions he was facing on the road.
1088	7068	3	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings, meaning no help was available for the cyclist. He was tired and dehydrated because he had run out of water, and no one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist, despite being dehydrated, kept going toward his destination. The road was mostly straight, but almost at the end there were many hills that posed a significant challenge. Along with having to bike up the steep hills, he almost ran into a snake, adding a sudden element of danger. The weather was intensely hot, he had no water, and under these harsh conditions, he could have died, highlighting the severe risks presented by the isolated and unforgiving environment.
1089	7069	3	3	The features in the setting of the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the biker. For example, the relentless heat is constantly drying the biker out, exacerbating his thirst. Also, at the first town, the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause, as the water tasted like “battery acid,” leaving him without a viable source of refreshment. Even after that, more problems arose. There was a sign that posted a maximum speed limit, which the biker was doing about one-fifth of, and this stark contrast affected his mood, making him realize that it would be a long and arduous ride. The pebbles that he found helped him out somewhat, as he remembered reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth can calm your thirst. Finally, the bait store at the end of his trip gave him the relief that he desperately needed. In conclusion, the setting makes the rider's journey a challenging one, but in the end, the bait store had just what he needed to recover and continue.
1090	7070	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist significantly. For example, there were no towns close by, which created a sense of isolation. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were nearer to each other, he could have easily reached a store if he ran out of water. In addition, he was at risk of a heatstroke in the remote area, and with no one around to get help from, he could easily have died from such a medical emergency. In my point of view of the reading, I believe the remote location where he was cycling is what affected him the most, as the lack of nearby resources and assistance defined the perilous nature of his entire journey.
1091	7071	3	3	The hot weather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can’t find more water. The hills are rough and the uneven terrain is draining the energy he has left. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down into small, manageable plants he wants to get to, focusing on one landmark at a time just to keep moving. He gets drained physically and emotionally from the relentless sun and the seemingly endless climb. He has a hard journey, a test of his will against the elements.
1092	7072	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is after “wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting, a constant and oppressive force. “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist, creating a landscape of mirages and false hope. The arid environment directly dictates his physical state and survival chances.
1093	7073	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie had many obstacles to overcome. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, “my gosh, what did I get myself into?!” Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day as the path grew more difficult. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost in the vast, unfamiliar terrain. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired, sapping his strength with each arduous incline. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in, a reward for his perseverance.
1094	7074	3	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehydrated it's not healthy and you can die from it, making his situation perilous. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down, along with the sweat that evaporates from his skin. As long as he has some liquid left in his body to produce sweat, it should be enough to manage for a short while, though the threat remains ever-present.
1095	7075	3	3	"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting effect the author, because it shows how he starts off strong and determined and is left weak and doubtful. In the beginning of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip under the cool morning air. Later on in the story, he describes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.” He is describing the heat and what he is facing, a brutal and unforgiving landscape. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated and worn out, his initial optimism faded. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" He is relieved, the harsh setting finally giving way to a place of respite. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well, moving from hope to despair and back again."
1096	7076	3	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist; for example, temperature really changes everything. If it’s too hot, you’re going to get tired really easily and can become dehydrated quickly. Then again, if it's too cold, breathing gets really hard and your muscles can stiffen up. The biker in the story was in a desert area in June, so it was really hot, tiring, and the sun was relentless. Also, the terrain affects a cyclist significantly. If the road is filled with hills, getting up those steep inclines is difficult and requires great effort. If it’s all downhill, it’s really easy and you can gain speed, but all uphill is hard, while level terrain is fairly easy to navigate. The cyclist in the story was initially in level terrain, which allowed for steady progress, but then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out and drained his energy. Ultimately, the various features of the setting really affect a cyclist's performance and endurance on a journey.
1097	7077	3	3	The setting profoundly affects the cyclist because he is faced with unfamiliar roadways he is unsure of, the weather is intensely hot and dry, and there is the constant presence of wild animals. Navigating unknown paths requires extra caution and can slow his pace considerably. The text states that the harsh, arid conditions lead to rapid dehydration and exhaustion. Furthermore, the potential encounter with wildlife, such as snakes or coyotes, adds an element of danger and stress to his ride. These combined factors of the environment create a challenging and hazardous experience for the cyclist, impacting both his physical state and his mental focus throughout the journey.
1098	7078	3	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist, shaping his entire experience. First, it is a very hot and dry climate in June, which saps his strength and fluids. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through the high deserts where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and carefully maneuver his way down. The ascents are grueling, and the descents require control and focus. With all of these obstacles and the oppressive heat slowing him down, he will need water frequently but is already running dangerously low on his supply. This scarcity of water in the arid landscape compounds his physical struggle, making his journey a true test of endurance against the elements.
1099	7079	3	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross, a vast and unforgiving landscape. He wasn't traveling in a car; he was riding a bike, and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike, which offers little protection from the elements. ""The speed limit was quite high. I was doing a water depleting pace. Sometimes life can be so cruel."" In the horrible, extreme degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rapid rate that he’s at a severe risk of running out completely. Not only that, but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he could pass out from exhaustion or, as he fears, ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades."" So I would say the narrator was pretty hassled by his surroundings, his journey defined by a constant battle against the heat and his own depleting resources."
1100	7080	3	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people traveling through a harsh environment. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink, but the town's water he was in now tasted like battery acid, so that’s not safe to drink, leaving him without a viable source. As he started to head out, the scenery changed noticeably. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to would be abandoned or not used, a desolate place. He saw a huge rattlesnake and tumbleweed, which are usual signs of a desert ecosystem. It was hard for him to keep his balance, as he says, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” making every pedal stroke a struggle. He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasn't thirsty anymore, a desperate measure highlighting the severity of his situation. This shows how the desert setting directly challenged his physical well-being and resourcefulness."
1101	7081	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist significantly because at first he had to carefully watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, forcing him to remain constantly vigilant. Then the streets themselves were crooked and bumpy, so the difficult road structure threw him off a bit, disrupting his rhythm and balance. Furthermore, he was riding his bike in June when it was very hot, and due to his lack of water he began to think he was going to have a heatstroke. These challenging things collectively affected how the cyclist performed on his bike, ultimately diminishing his endurance and focus.
1102	7082	3	3	The cyclist is riding through the vast, high deserts in California, a landscape where everything looks the same for miles, creating a disorienting and monotonous experience. The cyclist is dangerously dehydrated and his condition is getting worse because he has no protection from the relentless sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water, deepening his sense of isolation. The cyclist says, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This desolate discovery made the cyclist doubt the old timer's directions profoundly. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across any notable landmark after at least twenty miles of empty travel. The oppressive heat, the critical lack of water, and the complete lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean.” When the cyclist finally spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, he says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy to reach it. The harsh desert conditions profoundly affected the cyclist's physical state and morale.
1103	7083	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry and frustrated with his situation. He states that “don’t remember the saying don’t take candy from strangers,” so we know he is upset about something and regretting his own naivete. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it’s wrong, a realization the man figures out halfway through the story. He also said that “the old man hasn’t been off his porch since Carter was in office,” so he feels the man needs to get his directions up to date, highlighting the source of his irritation. So the beginning of his journey is marked by a distinctly negative attitude born from this misguided trust.
1104	7084	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the settings affected the character deeply because he thought he wouldn’t make it to the park because of the way things looked around him, which appeared hostile and endless. Because of the intimidating rolling hills and the ever-present threat of snakes he didn’t think he would make it anywhere and genuinely thought he was going to die in that desolate place. The overwhelming and dangerous nature of the environment filled him with a sense of hopelessness. That’s how the setting affected the character, shaping his fears and challenging his survival.
1105	7085	3	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listened to some old men who gave him directions for a supposed shortcut, which he initially trusted. When he began his trip everything was fine and the riding was manageable. But then he found that along the “shortcut” there was no building or sign of life for miles. By the time he figured out that the old men were mistaken he had almost run out of his precious water supply. There was nothing around that he could drink, and he was getting very thirsty and desperate. The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn’t make his task any easier, as the heat was extreme. About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder by adding physical strain. Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it, just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory, which was a cruel disappointment. This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice, taunting his own thirst. In the end he finally made it to a paint shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could, bringing his arduous journey to a close.
1106	7086	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly, shaping his resolve and his methods. For example when he was riding on the long, empty road he would pick a destination and ride to it with singular focus. Then he would take a brief break to recover. If this destination was a building, a clear mark of civilization, he would be strong willed and determined to reach it. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but endless, rolling hills, he would just ride on with a sense of fatalism and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world, surrendering to the landscape's demands.
1107	7087	3	3	One ramsackle shed with a sagging roof, several rusty pumps that looked long abandoned, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule greeted me upon my arrival. This desolate sight was deeply troubled, offering no solace. There was no one in sight, not a single building, car, or man-made structure of any kind beyond this ruin. With any luck, Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat to end the struggle. Rough road lay ahead; if he didnít take the old mans advice about the route, he would have enjoyed his bike ride far more, but now he desperately needed a new map to find his way out.
1108	7088	3	3	The features in the story affect the cyclist profoundly, primarily by not having anything to drink for many miles. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for what seemed like an eternity, a dangerous situation. He could have died from the severe lack of provisions. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is the utter isolation, for no one is around for miles in any direction. If he died out there, collapsed on the trail, no one would no know for days, perhaps even weeks. I know this because in the story he said ì There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, confirming his complete solitude. The last feature is that it was oppressively hot, a relentless sun. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in the California desert, baking the earth and the traveler upon it.
1109	7089	3	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties of some kind. For the main character in this story, thus a very true and challenging reality. His first crucial mistake was when he took directions from the ìold-timersî on the porch; by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way into desolate territory. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch and later reflected, ìwhat I shouldnít have done was to let them see my map,"" revealing his regret. Another serious problem he faced was when he began to run out of water in the heat. This caused a dire problem to him because of the threat of severe dehydration. In the story he said, ìThe water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips,î highlighting his desperation. Furthermore, another problem he encountered was the vast, empty desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasnít anybody around for miles to help him if he needed it or if he faltered. In the story he says, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind,î emphasizing his isolation. By reading this story, weíve realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed with perseverance and careful planning."
1110	7090	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a steep hill and then hopefully find a factory for some juice to replenish himself. Like if the cyclist donít find any building or source of aid, he would of kept riding over the next hill and wasted the little bit of energy he had left for actually surviving, leaving him completely depleted and stranded in the harsh environment.
1111	7091	3	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert, a vast and sun-scorched landscape. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating heavily and having a trouble time trying to pedal against the loose sand. The relentless heat and the complete absence of shade made her journey feel endless and particularly grueling, amplifying her desperate need for water.
1112	7092	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can’t tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California. The cyclist recalled, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June.î The effect on his body would be rather devastating, leading to severe dehydration and physical exhaustion. The intense, dry heat of the desert environment rapidly drained his energy and resources, making the simple act of pedaling a monumental task.
1113	7093	3	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water, which becomes a critical problem. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road where he has no water at the time there, a decision he soon regrets. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels, a much safer and more manageable path. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3, learning a valuable lesson about preparation. That is how you should stick things at in the future, by staying on a proven and reliable course.
1114	7094	3	3	The biker has many features in his story that make it vivid. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head, creating a clear mental image. For example ìOne long, crippling hillî I can picture it in my head, a steep and exhausting incline. ìThere was no one in sight.î All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head, building a sense of isolation. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help to fully immerse them in the narrative experience.
1115	7095	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly. One way is that the ìrolling hillsî @MONTH1 let the rider get more tired, constantly challenging his stamina. Another way is the lack of water from severe heat, which poses a constant threat to his well-being. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way can either help or hinder progress. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome of the entire journey. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go, ensuring they are prepared for the challenges of the environment.
1116	7096	3	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” profoundly reflects upon the cyclist's journey and the lessons he learns. In the story, a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men he meets along the way. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime, such as roads and landmarks. He says, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination, leading him through a long and arduous path. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says, “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right and reliable, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible based on outdated knowledge.
1117	7097	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot, creating a physically demanding ordeal. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and rough road with plenty of hills to make it hard for a bike to out come. The harsh, unrelenting sun beat down upon him as he pedaled. he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him, pushing his endurance to its very limits in the challenging environment.
1118	7098	3	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going to ensure he takes the correct and safest route. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do, as it would put his health and safety at significant risk. It is always wiser to be prepared and informed before embarking on any journey, especially one that could involve potential hardships.
1119	7099	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood throughout the essay, charting a clear emotional journey. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay and his spirits were high. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain, which begins to wear on his optimism. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain was the first sign of difficulty. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself determinedly to the next “town”, feeling increasingly helpless. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting, a sign of civilization. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake, and he has learned from his earlier error. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude, as clearly demonstrated by this cycling experience.
1120	7100	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert and it is in the summer, creating an extremely hostile environment. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike, which offers no protection from the elements. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water, a critical resource in such a climate. He is starting to git dehyjradid, which severely impacts his physical condition and ability to continue his journey under the scorching sun. The desert setting thus poses a direct and dangerous threat to his well-being.
1121	7101	3	3	The setting profoundly affected the cyclist because of the mood it created and how every environmental change happened. For instance, when the setting changed from one location to another, the cyclist felt different, and it really affected his emotional state. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice, welcoming town then he would feel good and optimistic, but if he was in a dark, foreboding town he wouldn’t feel very happy or safe. So the setting, through its inherent atmosphere, really affected him and his journey's morale.
1122	7102	3	3	After some time into his trip he mentioned, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I believe that this harsh, arid setting had initially gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live and overcome the challenge. But then he started to think he might die from the ordeal, but he wasn't sad or upset about it, he was surprisingly happy and at peace. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the absurd fact that he might die simply because he listened to some old men's directions. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life, finding a strange joy in pedaling through this severe and beautiful setting of California, embracing the experience fully.
1123	7103	3	3	Where the cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The few advantages were that their were hills to go down, which provided moments of rest. The disadvantages were far more numerous: hills to go up, his water running out when he is in the middle of no where, the weather being very hot out, and being lost in the vast desert, where he doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory in the distance. The biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no protection from the elements and has to peddle constantly to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite a bad and dangerous situation. He is very lucky that he made it up the final hill or else he would’ve died out there from exposure. And he thought he was seeing things, but it was a good thing he checked it out and found salvation. I think for future reference, one should ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not too smart and far too perilous.
1124	7104	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water, all he’s doing is getting scared and panicking, which is directly influenced by his surroundings. In other words, when he’s looking around, the setting he sees is barren like a desert with no buildings or signs of life. The story says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” and when he sees that endless, dry landscape he panics and thinks he’s not gonna make it, which affects him mentally by filling him with dread and desperation. The oppressive environment thus plays a key role in his psychological state.
1125	7105	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways, often creating perilous situations. The woman who had listened to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out of water and almost died of thirst in the unforgiving landscape. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback” which heightened the sense of danger. The harsh conditions and her deteriorating state caused her to start seeing things that wasn’t there, showing how the setting’s features directly impacted her perception and physical well-being.
1126	7106	3	3	He was affected by the crippling hills, the rough condition of the road, a snake blocking his path, and a critical lack of water. His water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, which were insufficient for the journey and intensified his thirst. The hills were steep and relentless, draining his energy with each difficult climb. A long snake stretched across the road presented a significant obstacle, causing him to stop and ponder how to get past it safely. Furthermore, the roads were so rough and poorly maintained that traveling over the speed limit of 55 mph was not advisable, adding to the difficulty of his progress. So he was affected in a lot of different ways, not just one, with each challenge compounding the others to make his journey arduous.
1127	7107	3	3	The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also fuel his determination to escape them. He passes through ghost towns and abandoned buildings, encountering diamondback snakes along the way. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and they would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of dropping dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking, albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing what he believed to be his last burst of energy. He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind, one that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns the entire harrowing experience into a lesson he’ll surely abide by for the future: always follow the map.
1128	7108	3	3	The cyclist is profoundly affected by the intense heat, the challenging hills, and the complete lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing dangerously short on water and had wide rings of dried sweat on his shirt, clear signs of severe dehydration, and he feared he could drop from heatstroke at any moment. The steep and numerous hills must have forced him to use significantly more energy, slowing his progress and increasing his exhaustion. Lastly, the land was devoid of people; the towns he passed were empty and silent. If the towns still had people, the cyclist wouldn't have been as affected by the setting, as he could have sought aid, directions, or at least the comfort of human presence.
1129	7109	3	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it, and in this case, the features affect the cyclist through water scarcity, the absence of help, and concerns for his safety. The quote, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate,” shows his desperate need for water, revealing he resorted to sucking on a rock to stimulate his own saliva. The rough terrain and the abandoned road the old men sent him on, which was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions and left him uncertain if he was even travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake, a dangerous encounter. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have had no one to help save him from dying on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke, he had no water and no one to call for help. Safety, help, and water are all critical factors which contribute to the features of the setting, and they profoundly affect the cyclist's journey and his chances of survival.
1130	7110	3	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard and dangerous. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy with every arduous climb. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry, with a relentless sun beating down. This makes the author need more water than he normally would, a resource that was in short supply. The author stated, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” a time known for extreme heat. The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without sufficient water, as he said, “I could drop from heatstroke,” a real and constant fear. If the setting had been cooler and less arid, there would not have been so much danger, making the environment itself his greatest adversary.
1131	7111	3	3	The cyclist’s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), a landscape defined by its harsh, arid conditions. His water bottle was slowly running out, and the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like battery acid, offering no true relief. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory, a beacon of potential salvation. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), a cruel and tantalizing mirage. The building was abandoned, dashing his hopes for sustenance. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up, defeated by the environment. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water, demonstrating how a setting can directly shape a traveler's morale and physical state.
1132	7112	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because there were lots of hills and very little water. The challenging terrain of the hills demanded constant physical exertion, sapping his energy with each difficult ascent. Combined with the scarcity of water in the arid environment, these geographic features created a situation of extreme physical distress. The relentless climbs under the sun intensified his thirst, making the lack of a reliable water source even more critical. Ultimately, the combination of these harsh features—the demanding hills and the severe dehydration—profoundly impacted his ability to continue his journey.
1133	7113	3	3	"The cyclist in the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the ‘shortcut’ that is suggested to get to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water, isolating him in a vast, empty landscape. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die, a feeling compounded by his solitude. In the story, he says: ‘It really didn’t matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.’ This shows that the features of the setting made him feel hopeless, as the unforgiving environment convinced him of his impending demise."
1134	7114	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. One feature that affected the character was the heat of the sun, which intensified the harshness of his journey. The narration states “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@CAPS1), signaling the start of an increasingly oppressive and draining day. This relentless heat would have accelerated his dehydration, making his physical struggle more severe. The rising temperature thus acted as a key environmental pressure, directly influencing his deteriorating condition and adding to the overall challenge of his ride through the desert.
1135	7115	3	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working, highlighting the inherent danger of the location. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting, as his physical coordination is failing. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, especially in the summer, creating a perilous environment for any strenuous activity. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death, a real threat the cyclist faces. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist by illustrating the direct link between the arid landscape and the protagonist's physical decline."
1136	7116	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One significant thing is the water, or rather the lack of it. There is little water to be found, and what little he encountered was boiling hot. He took a small taste of it, and he said “It tasted like battery acid,” which was completely unpalatable. To me, if the water is that hot, one should not even consider tasting it. Another impactful thing is the land itself. The land went from being straight and flat to becoming increasingly hilly and difficult. That change in terrain started slowing him down considerably, making his progress a struggle. Last, is the factor of day time. It started turning dark while he was still biking, and he was determined to get as far as he could before nightfall completely halted his journey. These environmental challenges collectively shaped his difficult experience on the road.
1137	7117	3	3	The features in the setting profoundly affected the cyclist, who found himself getting tired very easily because he was biking across the desert in the intense heat of June. There are no rivers or streams in that particular desert, so he couldn’t get any water to cool down or rehydrate, which worsened his fatigue. It is so exceptionally hot out there that his vision was impaired; he couldn’t see very well because of all the sweat that persistently dripped into his eyes, stinging and blurring his sight. Also, there are no other people anywhere out there because of how oppressively hot it is, leaving him completely isolated in the vast, empty landscape. This profound solitude and the harsh climatic conditions made his journey an immense physical and mental trial.
1138	7118	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting deeply affected the cyclist both mentally and physically. When the setting was pleasant and the surroundings were nice, he naturally had a positive outlook on his journey and was full of energy, feeling motivated to continue. Later in the essay, however, as the setting grew less appealing and became more treacherous with difficult terrain and harsh conditions, the cyclist correspondingly grew weary and increasingly distressed. This direct correlation shows how the external environment can dictate a traveler's internal state, ultimately shaping the entire experience of the journey from a hopeful beginning to a grueling test of endurance.
1139	7119	3	3	A cyclist always has to face many problems that are dictated by the environment, such as the weather and the condition of the road, among other external factors. Inclement weather, like heavy rain or extreme heat, can make a journey dangerous and exhausting, while a poorly maintained road with potholes or debris presents a constant physical challenge to navigate. These elements are ever-present concerns that require constant adaptation and resilience from any rider. Therefore, overcoming these persistent obstacles is a fundamental part of the cycling experience, demanding both preparation and fortitude from anyone who undertakes a long-distance ride.
1140	7120	3	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways during his arduous journey. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was completely deserted, leaving him entirely alone with no access to water or supplies. In the story it says, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war – but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote effectively explains that he was profoundly alone and that the first town he visited was utterly deserted, offering no respite. The next example of how the features and the settings impacted him further illustrates the profound challenges of his solitary trek through the barren landscape, where every mile presented a new hardship to overcome.
1141	7121	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist profoundly; the pervasive lack of water made him deeply tired and a bit delusional, his mind beginning to play tricks on him. The complete absence of shade from the relentless sun dramatically increased the rate of his dehydration, sapping his strength with every passing mile. The rough, uneven road surface made it incredibly hard to maintain his balance, demanding constant physical effort. And the meager snack he had consumed earlier seemed to have slowed him down rather than providing energy. In his weakened state, he genuinely thought that he was going to die, a terrifying conviction born directly from his harsh environment.
1142	7122	3	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" is very important to the events that occurred in the story. For example, the story was set on a long, open highway where the posted speed limit was set at a high velocity which the cyclist was only able to do a fraction of on his bicycle. This is significant to the events of the story because since he was pushing himself to maintain this considerable speed, which by the way is a lot for a cyclist, it led to him almost reaching a state of severe dehydration. Plus, the route was hilly, adding to the physical strain. This grueling combination of factors ultimately led to the extreme exhaustion of the cyclist, so one could see that the setting is very important to the outcome of the story."
1143	7123	3	3	The setting is in a California desert, which isn’t really the coolest of places to be, especially in terms of its extreme temperature. The heat is a constant, oppressive force, bearing down on the landscape and anyone traversing it. This intense warmth defines the atmosphere and the challenges faced there, making it a central feature of the environment. The sheer heat of the location fundamentally shapes the experience within the narrative.
1144	7124	3	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and appreciative of the features of his environment. He says, “I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening,” indicating a peaceful state of mind. At a campground in the foothills, the setting is calming and relaxing, offering a gentle start. At the first deserted town, the setting becomes shocking, but still humorous to the cyclist, though he starts to get a little nervous. After looking around he says, “this sight was troubling.” The cyclist's trip gets decidedly worse when he reads the description for the next town and finds that the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This more demanding part of his journey affects him the most, draining his energy. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty, proving that the setting has a major role in determining a cyclist's experience."
1145	7125	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively more bleak and unforgiving. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town and remarks, ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively and with humor at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings, and he feels that this sight is ""troubling."" While the cyclist is now worried, he is not yet fully depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain changes drastically, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name. ""The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12,"" he notes, adding, ""Sometimes life’s road can feel so cruel."" The cyclist’s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but eventually he finds a lone building with working water. He is so overjoyed by this discovery that he wants to find the owners and kiss them out of sheer gratitude for the relief it provides."
1146	7126	3	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the desert. He says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scorching hot pedaling a bike under a relentless sun. The road became bumpy and curvy, a challenging surface for any rider. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit.” The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps, jolting him with every turn of the wheel. The lastly he comes across a poisonous snake that blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. So him, dehydrated and fatigued, trying to get around a snake would be terrifying, a final obstacle in a harsh landscape. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn’t help him much, presenting one difficulty after another.
1147	7127	3	3	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to endure many hardships such as a profound lack of water, the disorientation of being lost, and the immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and poor road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship, an unyielding adversary. That and the lack of water created a desperate situation. Though the heat started playing with the cyclists’ brain by making them see mirages, etc., distorting their perception of reality. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists’ travel much harder, testing their physical and mental limits to the extreme.
1148	7128	3	3	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside, the environment was inherently hostile. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool, sapping his energy with every passing mile. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist has very little water and is now having to endure the hardest part of the ride, a cruel combination of challenges. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness, showing his deteriorating state. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke, a real and dangerous possibility. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways, from his physical stamina to his very sense of awareness.
1149	7129	3	3	"The setting of the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted, a vast and empty landscape. On his way to Yosemite he takes a “short cut"" from so he do me through the desert, a decision that would define his journey. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence, feeling optimistic about the ride ahead. “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.” With this he arrives at the first “town” but hes wasn’t worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on, still feeling prepared. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, becoming more difficult and demanding. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.” This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him, a lonely and frightening thought. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on, pushing through the adversity. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed with relief and the terrain flattens out again, offering a brief respite. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest, regaining a sense of control. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions, concluding his arduous trek with hard-won self-reliance."
1150	7130	3	3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, a distant dream. @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a damper on your experience, transforming a pleasurable activity into a grueling test. @CAPS2 it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having to expend just to keep moving. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, a necessary mental trick for survival. @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, forging resilience through adversity, but adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture, pushing the limits of human endurance. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation, a journey defined more by suffering than by scenery.
1151	7131	3	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite National Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it would have made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle might have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasnít. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that, offering no supplies or respite. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic, making it undrinkable. Also, he wouldnít have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot, but the constant elevation changes were draining. Itís easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva in a desperate attempt to stave off thirst. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it.
1152	7132	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike through the high deserts of California in June, make the intensity level of the story very high. The oppressive, dry heat of the desert sun significantly increases the physical challenge and danger of the journey. If it would have been a cooler month and there was a nice breeze it would be different, transforming the arduous trek into a potentially pleasant ride. The harshness of the environment is therefore a central element that defines the entire experience for the rider.
1153	7133	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by the lack of water, a poisonous snake, and the condition of the road. For example, the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it without water; he could have passed out from severe dehydration if he didn't have any. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake; if he would have gotten bitten he could have died, cause there would be nobody around to help him in the remote location. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the condition of the road because it made it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with its steep hills and windy rounds. This is how I think the setting profoundly affected the cyclist and his difficult journey.
1154	7134	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if itís hot and you're riding a long way you need a lot of water so you donít become dehydrated and suffer from heat exhaustion. Also, the bright, glaring sun can affect your vision cause you are looking directly at it or its reflection on the pavement for long periods. Another way a cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape; it can affect the way they ride their bike, causing physical strain and making it harder to maintain control and speed. These environmental factors combine to create a significant challenge for any rider.
1155	7135	3	3	"The story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie had some statements that were kind of pointless to put in. One of the sentences in the essay had a couple of words that donít need to be used. In the sentence, ""about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first ìtown,î"" I donít think the phrase ìinto the pedalî needs to be in there because its not describing anything crucial and the sentence would be clearer without it. This kind of unnecessary wording can slightly disrupt the flow of the narrative for the reader. While the overall story is engaging, such minor edits could improve its conciseness and impact."
1156	7136	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, primarily through the harsh desert environment. The cyclist is out in the desert, in two-hundred degree weather with very little water, which creates a severe physical challenge. Also, the cyclist didn't have a map and he asked for directions from someone that hasn't left their porch since Carter was in office, leading him astray. The quote, ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades,'' powerfully illustrates how the setting, with its extreme heat and desolation, can endanger him. This experience shows how the physical landscape and the unreliable information from isolated locals directly impacted his journey. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist, putting his health and progress at risk.
1157	7137	3	3	The setting of the story is very desert-like, characterized by intense heat and vast, arid landscapes, which forced the cyclist to push himself to his physical limits. The conditions on the road are very rough, with sharp turns and challenging terrain that test his endurance. At one point in the story, he gets a boost of energy and pedals as hard as he can down a hill, enjoying a moment of speed and relative ease, before he eventually relaxes and coasts, finding a brief respite from his exertions. This cycle of strenuous effort and momentary relief is dictated entirely by the setting. This description of the setting and its demands provides a summary of the story's central physical conflict.
1158	7138	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist profoundly because of the condition of his surroundings. The intense heat caused him to become dehydrated more quickly, so he needed more water and had to carefully manage his limited supply. Furthermore, there were a lot of steep hills, which forced him to pedal harder and use significantly more energy to reach the top of each ascent, draining his stamina. In contrast to these hardships, the setting also offered a positive aspect; there were no cars, buildings, or smog, just pure nature. This provided a peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike at times, offering a mental reprieve. That is how the setting, with its mix of physical challenges and natural tranquility, affects the cyclist throughout his journey.
1159	7139	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way, as his journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have a significant effect on him. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate of California, in the heat of June, with a severe lack of water, so he must pace his sips carefully. There are also very few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies. The cyclist also comes across a snake, showing he is affected by the native wild life. The dry climate and lack of water affects him by seeding doubt; he is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. He also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect, highlighting the dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist, challenging him mentally and physically. His journey does teach you, though, that through determination you will be rewarded, as you have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always maintain a positive attitude to achieve success despite the obstacles.
1160	7140	3	3	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the inherent dangers of his undertaking. He initially took advice from old people who encouraged him to do it, but even though it started out good, almost nothing lasts forever. He's riding his bike in the middle of summer with little water and in the harsh desert environment, which poses a constant threat. He runs into towns that are abandoned, and a sign warns him that the next town is only a few miles away but that the road ahead is literally going to be rough. His situation seems dire when he gets to another town that was also abandoned, testing his morale. However, he eventually found hope upon seeing a man in a chair, a sign of life that renewed his spirit and showed that perseverance can lead to a breakthrough.
1161	7141	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by not being in town, creating a sense of unfamiliarity and isolation. I say this because the cyclist talks about “old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This statement implies that the local advice he receives is outdated, which means he doesn't really know where he's at or what to expect from the remote landscape. The unfamiliar terrain, far from any urban center, directly challenges his journey and his sense of direction, ultimately shaping his difficult experience.
1162	7142	3	3	In the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders, which misdirects his route. The second is that because the information wasn't true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water for the actual distance, and this shortage made him dehydrated and weak. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings, which made the cyclist less confident in his ability to proceed. Those are the key features of the setting which affected the cyclist and his progress toward his destination.
1163	7143	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist significantly, primarily because he should have stuck to his own map instead of deviating from his planned route. He also should have packed an extra bottle of water to prepare for the unexpected challenges of the arid landscape. Ultimately, he learns a crucial lesson about not taking any advice from people that haven't left the porch in years, as their knowledge of the area is limited and unreliable. This reliance on poor guidance, combined with his own lack of preparation, is how the setting directly impacts his journey.
1164	7144	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist's mood in the story as the cyclist takes a shortcut with many abandoned towns and buildings as well as a bumpy terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump, he immediately began to pump it, but the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town, stating, “I could make that.” Because of the ghost town and the old pump, he had to continue on without relief. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road ahead, he began to get depressed, recalling, “I was sad.” Finally, when he reached the more welcoming locations of Fish Camp, he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood; at first the cyclist is determined, but as the setting gets worse, his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end, when the setting is bright and hospitable, so is his mood, concluding the journey on a positive note.
1165	7145	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and it was hot, and he was almost out of water. The harsh environment nearly led to a dire outcome when, while he was drinking the last of his water, he hit a bump and a bit of spit got lodged in his throat, causing a moment of panic. Furthermore, the tiring hills of the landscape seemed to never end, sapping his energy and prolonging his exposure to the difficult conditions. This combination of heat, thirst, and exhausting terrain created a severe challenge that profoundly impacted his physical state and his journey.
1166	7146	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was not prepared in the beginning. The cyclist got directions from an old man who had not left his porch in years, so he would not know what had changed in the landscape. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water, which was a critical oversight. When he got to the second town, he notes, “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote means that he was not expecting hills, as he thought it was going to be a flat way the entire journey. Also in the high degree heat with a limited water supply, he could not easily ride up and down the hills, which required more effort. Going down the hills gave him a brief break from the strenuous climbing. That is how the cyclist was profoundly affected by the settings features, learning a hard lesson about preparation.
1167	7147	3	3	A lot of factors affected the cyclist throughout his journey. Temperature, terrain, and directions all gave the cyclist doubt and challenged his resolve. The intense temperature through the high deserts of California left the cyclist feeling hot, parched, and irritable, sapping his energy. Through the story, he had all but a few sips of his water left, which heightened his anxiety. Knowing you are running low on water leads one “to feel sorry for himself,” as the text states. The cyclist had biked so far that the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills,” a significant shift. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levels before, demanding new physical adaptations. Lastly, the feeling of hopelessness could have affected him the most, as morale is crucial. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome on such a demanding trip. Having just leisurely taken instructions from an old man who was out of touch cost the cyclist hours of mental and physical torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exaggerate the cyclist's feeling of lost hope, emphasizing his despair. He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a vivid picture of the harsh environment. These literary elements made it easier for me to understand the profound effect of the temperature, terrain, and hope had on the bicyclist, illustrating how setting shapes experience.
1168	7148	3	3	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist, shaping his experience and leading him into danger. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings, which appear more manageable than they truly are. Little does he know that the deceptive landscape would bring him into serious peril, testing his limits. When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not working, he realizes he is in serious danger, with his resources failing. In the reading it says, “The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” This shows how the setting, specifically the appealing idea of his destination, let the cyclist's mind wander so much that he did not even realize the immediate, oppressive heat, demonstrating the power of mental escape. This disconnect between expectation and reality ultimately underscores how the environment dictated his ordeal.
1169	7149	3	3	In the short story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the author expresses how the features of the setting, like the pervasive lack of water and the inability to find help, affect the cyclist profoundly. During his time of need, the cyclist says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men and their wisdom.” This shows the cyclist confronting a severe lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall away, completely giving up on hope. When the cyclist later finds hope at a crucial moment, his perspective shifts, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The cyclist was astonished by what he had stumbled onto and deeply appreciated that he was still alive after his harrowing experience. The cyclist should not have taken the old people's advice for granted, but he will now look onto people’s sense of directions with much greater caution and skepticism, having learned from his misadventure.
1170	7150	3	3	Setting affects many things in stories, establishing the context for the characters' challenges. The setting in this story affected the cyclist significantly, dictating the pace and difficulty of his journey. The setting was very hot and it slowed him down a lot, draining his stamina and resolve. For example, he said he was doing 55 miles, but the oppressive heat made such a distance feel insurmountable, demonstrating how the environment directly impeded his progress and shaped his entire experience.
1171	7151	3	3	"The setting in the story was the ""high deserts of California in June,"" a place known for its intense, dry heat. At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey, but it was during the arduous ride itself that his mind had changed. The cyclist was running low on his water supply, so he stops and pumps water from an old water pump, but all he gets is this acid taste, which was undrinkable. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it, clinging to that hope. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing dramatically. It changes from a flat road to short rolling hills that seem to go on forever. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope, his initial confidence shattered. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart, a grim and vivid fear. Then when he thought he couldnít make it he saw a sign that said ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp,"" a sight that revived his spirit. He ran into the shop and took long, desperate drinks from the sink in the bathroom, quenching his terrible thirst. When he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map, perhaps still trying to maintain a semblance of control. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist, pushing him to his physical and mental limits. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing, a complete psychological shift. It states in the story ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirageî and ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,î showing his descent into despair. So this brought self doubting behavior, fundamentally altering his experience of the journey."
1172	7152	3	3	The features of the setting where the cyclist is traveling affect them very drastically, as the environment is harsh and unforgiving. They need a consistent water supply and if they donít have one they might dehydrate or even die, which is a constant danger in such a climate. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard, offering a crucial respite from the heat. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside, perhaps during the early morning or late evening, so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival by reducing fluid loss. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt, providing both practical aid and moral support. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency, such as a shop or a ranger station where one can find shelter and supplies. It might even be good to carry a cell phone for calling for help if one becomes stranded or injured, a modern safety precaution in a primitive landscape. Ultimately, being prepared for the setting's challenges is essential for a cyclist's safety and well-being.
1173	7153	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way, each element contributing to his mental and physical state. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule, all presenting a picture of abandonment. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts about his location and the accuracy of his directions. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated and no longer in use. Then, he couldnít get any cold, clean water out of the pumps to save his life, which was a severe disappointment. This was the first obstacle which affected him, deepening his anxiety. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake,"" adding elements of surprise and potential danger. They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things cautiously. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted ìI eased past,î indicating a careful and fearful movement. When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclistís journey became exhausting, never ending, and difficult, sapping his remaining energy. Two more things affected the cyclist significantly. These two things consist of the signs he encountered. One of which read ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other ìGARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, weíre your BEST BET."" The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope for an easier path. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect, offering salvation. These are the various features that had an affect on the cyclist throughout his challenging journey."
1174	7154	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist profoundly, primarily due to the changes in terrain that he encountered. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills, which demanded much more effort. The author wrote, ìI tolld on"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), suggesting a slow, laborious struggle. The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through, testing his endurance. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory, a symbol of decay and false hope. The narration states, ìover one long, crippling hill, a building came into view"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), highlighting the effort required just to reach it. The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling,"" which vividly describe the physical toll. @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip, emphasizing how the landscape itself was an antagonist in his story. Thus, the terrain's difficulty was a constant factor shaping his arduous experience."
1175	7155	3	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite, making his journey far more challenging than anticipated. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who hadenít gone the places they told him about in a long time, so their information was outdated. Where they said there would be a bustling town it was more like a ghost town, deserted and offering no resources. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse by creating a harsh, oppressive atmosphere. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated, which was a necessity. This meant he was running out of it fast, and since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldnít get more water, leading to a critical shortage. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition, @CAPS1 slowed him down even more, adding physical strain to his mental distress. Those features of the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip, turning an adventure into a fight for basic necessities and a test of survival.
1176	7156	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water from the arid environment and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride over uneven terrain and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait left by the roadside and gets a small amount of water. All of these environmental factors greatly affect the cyclist's physical condition throughout his journey.
1177	7157	3	3	The setting of the cyclist’s journey effected him because it was a hot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike through it and the intense heat took a lot out of him, draining his stamina. He didn’t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or any natural water supply because of the dry desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a small store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same necessary supplies which helped him recover. So in the end his surroundings first destroyed him and then ultimately relieved him.
1178	7158	3	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then, steep hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty, increasing his suffering. ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" The rider didn’t think he would live, thinking ""I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean"" but he found a rest stop place to get water, where he ""drank deeply from the sink"" and finished his ride successfully."
1179	7159	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers providing cool water. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the exposed desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The poor condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which meant that he needed more water which he didn’t have any of. The difficult condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so severely dehydrated.
1180	7160	3	3	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can’t and they shouldn’t do this or that such as the sign of “no entering” or “one way” which forces detours. Second, it’s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is posted, the cyclist only can ride about that speed and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn’t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode, such as the sign of “Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit” which demands caution. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the entire journal by imposing these various restrictions.
1181	7161	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they introduce significant obstacles that doubt or lessen his chances for survival, creating a constant state of peril. The harsh environment, with its extreme heat and desolate landscape, constantly challenges his resolve. However, the cyclist is fueled by a powerful determination, a will that pushes him to persevere through each hardship. This inner strength allows him to overcome the external threats, and so he ultimately survives the ordeal, proving his resilience against the unforgiving setting.
1182	7162	3	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist, primarily through the oppressive heat and scarcity of resources. One feature that significantly affects him is his critical lack of water, as described: ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came upon the Welch’s grape juice factory. The building—abandoned years earlier—had been a Welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant, a cruel irony that deepened his thirst. This desperation, after he had come to the abandoned factory, was followed by profound disappointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head,"" after he had found the empty building. These environmental details are some of the key features of the setting that affect the cyclist, shaping his emotional and physical journey."
1183	7163	3	3	The cyclist faces numerous challenges that explain why he isn't doing so well on his journey. I said no water because he is clearly dehydrated but needs to conserve his remaining water, creating a terrible dilemma. Also, he could easily die from heat exhaustion under the relentless sun. I also cited the rough terrain because he could fall on the jagged rocks and get seriously hurt with no one around to help him for miles. And to top it off, he took navigation info from old people that didn’t know what they were talking about, leading him astray. These are all concrete examples from the essay that support my writing about the difficulties imposed by the setting.
1184	7164	3	3	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie, it tells about a cyclist's formidable challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by a stubborn determination, then a fleeting sense of relief upon finding any landmark. The setting deeply affected the cyclist both physically and mentally throughout this trial. First, listening to the old men was a stupid miscalculation, then taking the trip without being certain if he would have enough water was a grave risk, and lastly, traveling through the desert in June was inherently dangerous. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, and that mental state won’t help much with bringing success to the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp, an old man even older than the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there, refusing to be misled again. He didn’t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours; that’s just unhealthy and a testament to the extreme conditions he endured.
1185	7165	3	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting that create constant physical demands. One feature of the setting that can have a major affect is the terrain itself. If the terrain is rough and uneven, then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider with extensive experience. For example, the author of the essay had a hard time on the rougher roads, partly due to his level of experience, which made the journey more perilous. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate and weather. Most people who go cycling regularly know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature, but sometimes the weather plays tricks on us, changing without warning. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave or an unexpected drop in temperature, each posing a unique threat to his endurance and safety.
1186	7166	3	3	The features of the setting enhance the cyclist’s desperate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around, creating a profound sense of isolation. This made him much more desperate because if he would fall from dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die, alone in the vast emptiness. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which got his hopes up for potential aid or resources, but would soon crush his spirits upon finding it abandoned and useless. These events made him much more desperate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation, highlighting his complete vulnerability.
1187	7167	3	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” (kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared, and the unfamiliar landscape fueled his anxiety. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear, using it as a psychological crutch. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes presenting new, unknown challenges. He wasn’t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further, driven by a determined will. The setting brought him fear but he made it through, demonstrating his resilience against the intimidating environment."
1188	7168	3	3	In the story the cyclist had ran out of water, a critical situation in the harsh environment. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid, indicating the poor quality of his last reserves. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles, amplifying his solitude. That brings despair, a deep feeling of being utterly alone and helpless. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and cactus all around, painting a picture of a relentless and unforgiving landscape. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade or nothing because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions, a place defined by its scarcity and extreme conditions that test human limits.
1189	7169	3	3	"The features of the setting, in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally, creating a dual burden. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak, sapping his physical strength with every mile. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting, which play tricks on his mind and morale. An example of this is when he sees the abandoned Welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"". This made him hang his head as he rode on, the cruel irony deepening his sense of deprivation. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out here, a thought born from the relentless mental toll of the landscape. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, intertwining his physical decline with psychological despair."
1190	7170	3	3	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story “As worry” because the author’s son surfs a lot, and the image captures the essence of his daily life. And it shows what he and his friends @MONTH1 look like, providing a visual connection to the characters described in the narrative. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing they are surfers, which is central to the story's theme and the son's passion. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second one only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing, but it lacks the specific personal connection and context of the first image. So in conclusion the first photograph is more accurate to the story than the second photo, as it better reflects the characters and their world.
1191	7171	3	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. ìone rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule greeted me.î Itís only him.ì At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake ñ it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions, marking a brief point of human contact in the vast, empty landscape. The journey through this desolate setting was long and isolating, emphasizing the sheer scale of the desert he had to cross.
1192	7172	3	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist. The harsh environmental conditions presented constant physical challenges, demonstrating the desert's dangerous and unforgiving nature for a lone traveler.
1193	7173	3	3	The cyclist in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldnít quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasnít been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welchís juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance, making his journey a severe test of his physical and mental limits. The relief he found was hard-won, highlighting the setting's role in creating his ordeal.
1194	7174	3	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desertís feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty, a state exacerbated by the relentless sun and the deceptive, energy-sapping terrain. His eventual relief was minor compared to the cumulative exhaustion inflicted by the setting."
1195	7175	3	3	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story ì@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit the rider runs intoî a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road. These physical obstacles directly challenged his progress, forcing him to expend extra effort and navigate carefully. Each obstacle in the setting served to slow his journey and increase the difficulty of his ride through the challenging landscape.
1196	7176	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere with no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty, and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously injuring himself with no one around to get help from. The setting of nowhere, with its vast emptiness and absence of any signs of life, creates a profound sense of vulnerability and danger for the cyclist, intensifying his physical discomfort and mental anxiety as he faces the treacherous descent alone.
1197	7177	3	3	The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don’t have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It is twice as hot during the summer, and the relentless sun and dry air would rapidly sap his strength, making the challenging terrain even more exhausting and perilous for a cyclist with dwindling water supplies.
1198	7178	3	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ""Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,"" this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might have changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on their porches all the time. This misguided advice directly impacts his journey, leading him to rely on outdated information in an unfamiliar landscape, which is why I think the setting affects the cyclist so significantly."
1199	7179	3	3	In the essay entitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to “Yosemite” and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This means they are not familiar with the changes to the roads. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead,” a warning that underscores how the isolated and unforgiving setting, combined with his poor directions, has led him into a difficult and hazardous situation.
1200	7180	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drinking and sweating water so he is really worn down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there contributes to his distress. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter, these elements of the harsh environment compound his physical exhaustion and amplify his sense of isolation and danger throughout his journey.
1201	7181	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting had a significant affect on the cyclist. The setting and the various features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The harsh environment caused him to doubt himself and the men who gave him directions, and it also kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in the California desert, affected him physically. It was intensely hot, and he had no water. This caused him to become profoundly tired and deeply frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine and determined, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to steep hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he had listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as his hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign for “Gary and Fish Camp” he started to regain a small amount of hope and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically, but mentally as well. He started off determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting finally seemed more hopeful and his goal appeared within reach.
1202	7182	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout his difficult journey. The text first mentions that, “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” This profound isolation shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him, amplifying his loneliness. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist's experience is, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” You can see through the cyclists eyes that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame and undrinkable. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water, a critical resource. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, “battery acid,” that he wouldn’t last much longer in the oppressive heat. In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, from his emotional state to his physical well-being.
1203	7183	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his arduous journey. The rusty water pump, the ominous highway sign, and the abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a “ramshackle shed” surrounded by “several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lames mule”, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can’t make it through the desert. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into a fierce determination to finish his journey. He says “sometimes life can be so cruel” as he notices the speed limit to be high, but he continues on, pedaling hard against the challenging terrain. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn’t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation “should please all sadists” reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling toward his destination.
1204	7184	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few significant ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn’t stay cool, becoming warm and unappealing. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated on a long, strenuous ride. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn’t know which way to go, feeling lost and uncertain. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling and offered no clear direction. Last but not least this water pump wasn’t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping with effort. The water wouldn’t cool down and was scarce. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid, making it impossible to drink. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey, each posing a unique challenge to his progress.
1205	7185	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several distinct ways during his journey. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land, demanding great physical exertion. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course for the tired rider. ""One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had a draining effect on the cyclist, sapping his strength. Another feature of the setting was the vast desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dangerously dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot and desperate the cyclist was becoming. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice on the sign makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive this ordeal. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building, symbolizing his crushed expectations. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist, both physically and mentally."
1206	7186	3	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, he is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, “but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst…” This detail is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this action is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him significantly more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you, demonstrating the profound impact of physical surroundings on an individual's endurance and well-being.
1207	7187	3	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot day. “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse, demanding greater physical exertion. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more, amplifying his distress. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor, creating a series of obstacles that challenged his journey at every turn.
1208	7188	3	3	According to the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he had no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating, creating a mental strain on top of his physical suffering. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more, as it was a cruel reminder of the refreshment he lacked. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot, shaping both his physical state and his psychological resolve.
1209	7189	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather for example when he said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt” this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagine what the character is going through because everything is written in details. The vivid description of the physical evidence of his struggle, the salt stains on his clothing, directly illustrates the oppressive heat and the toll it is taking on his body. This powerful imagery allows the reader to feel the cyclist's exhaustion and discomfort, showing how the harsh environmental conditions are central to his experience. The setting, therefore, is not just a backdrop but an active force that shapes the narrative and the character's ordeal.
1210	7190	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to the national park. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a town, which was, to him, considered a ghost town, emphasizing the isolation of his journey. Then he got to a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke, a fear compounded by the desolate surroundings. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, “Know the best way to get there?” The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man “yes, sir: I own a very good map”. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again, learning a valuable lesson about self-reliance from the challenging landscape he traversed.
1211	7191	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” the setting profoundly affected the cyclist's sense of direction. The cyclist initially knew where he was going and how to get there, but his journey was complicated when the old men told him their “short-cut.” This advice ultimately ruined his own sense of direction because he was attempting to follow out-dated directions from “old-timers that hadn’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” Their guidance, rooted in a landscape that had long since changed, created confusion and disorientation. That is how the specific setting and its inhabitants affected the cyclist's experience in the essay.
1212	7192	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness in the environment, then it motivates you more and allows for clearer thought. Than when there is a lot of distracting stuff around you, such as noise and visual clutter, it can break concentration and hinder progress. The tranquility of a quiet road, therefore, provides a more conducive atmosphere for a sustained and focused ride, directly impacting the cyclist's performance and state of mind.
1213	7193	3	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks – are all reasons why the setting is significant for the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on in his environment and what might happen next on such a demanding route. For example, a sign stating “Rough Road: Do not exceed posted speed limit” directly influences his actions. This particular setting lead to a lot of changes in his speed and level of caution. So yes the setting does reveals a lot about the potential dangers, and I guess it describes how the cyclist must react to it also by adapting his behavior. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story by presenting constant physical challenges.
1214	7194	3	3	What I believe is that the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that, “The old guys in the story remember things back how they used to be but as they say in the book the world is a fluid place and things change all the time.” Their memories were fixed in the past, while the actual roads and paths had evolved. So for the cyclist to find his way, he had to try and put together the pieces the old guys gave him with the reality of the present landscape, a difficult and frustrating task that was directly caused by the disconnect between the remembered setting and the real one.
1215	7195	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because you wouldn’t put the setting in heavy rain or he wouldn't be able to ride the bike effectively. Another one is you wouldn't have the setting in a city when the narrative describes nothing around but trees and rivers; the environment must be consistent with the action. The specific details of the location, such as weather and topography, are therefore crucial as they directly enable or constrain the cyclist's journey, defining what is possible within the story.
1216	7196	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for example he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills, which demanded more effort and drained his energy. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride at the speed he wanted; he had to go much slower and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him, forcing him to stop and wait cautiously. He became dehydrated under the relentless sun. He became sad and hopeless but still had a small reserve of energy to feel himself moving forward, a testament to his enduring will.
1217	7197	3	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone, sapping their strength with its dry, oppressive air. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater, leading to dizziness and a deep, pervasive thirst. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills, which strain the leg muscles and the lungs. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push up the hill, battling against the loose gravel. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface, requiring constant focus. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight, just an endless expanse of sand and scrub. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some, scanning the horizon for any sign of help. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope, a feeling that is as debilitating as the physical exhaustion. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength, their pace slowing to a weary crawl. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water, a true feat of human resilience.
1218	7198	3	3	The setting in the short story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist. The description, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the tamest mule greeted me,” made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere, a desolate and forgotten place offering no real refuge. The quote, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills, a physical challenge that compounded his sense of isolation. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist, shaping both his physical journey and his mental state throughout the narrative.
1219	7199	3	3	In the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope, however fleeting it may be. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch, whose vague gestures point him forward into the unknown. The directions seem incorrect at first, leading him down a path that appears just as barren as the one he left. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization, its crumbling walls a monument to failed enterprise and a stark reminder of his own precarious situation in the vast, empty landscape.
1220	7200	3	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exhaustion and dehydration. The cyclist being exhausted and dehydrated, or tired and thirsty, was beginning to wear down as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs, a constant physical trial. The cyclist explained the change by saying, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist’s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hills of this Californian desert roller coaster, each ascent a test of his diminishing stamina. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason, each pedal stroke becoming a conscious act of will. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud, small mercies that would make his arduous journey bearable.
1221	7201	3	3	The harsh desert setting affected the cyclist severely. Biking through the arid expanse while following outdated directions nearly got him killed, leading him dangerously off course. He also came across several broken down factories and desolate, abandoned towns, their skeletal remains causing him more dismay and a deepening sense of isolation. However, his fortunes changed when he came across a last stop, a small outpost that provided vital water and shelter, which ultimately saved his life and allowed him to continue his journey.
1222	7202	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is profoundly affected by his surrounding environment. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground, his spirits high and his water bottles full. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure with optimism. As the day went on and all he could find was abandoned buildings, silent and decaying, he began to worry a bit, his water running low as the sun beat down relentlessly. He come upon “one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps” with no sign of life, a sight that crushed his hope of finding aid. He realized that his trip was going to be rough and unforgiving. The environment and the very real risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward, a primal will to survive. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, his throat parched and cracked, he knew that “travelling through the high deserts of California in June” meant his only chances of survival was to keep going, to keep moving. The man's surroundings, both its threats and its vast emptiness, were what had pushed him to keep biking until he finally found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings and the dire stakes, he might have given up, but the thought of not making it out of the desert to “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite” would be too devastating a failure to accept.
1223	7203	3	3	The setting affects the rider in several critical ways because it is very hot, which makes him thirsty and physically drained. The immense length of the road, stretching endlessly toward the horizon, affects his mind state, fostering a sense of hopelessness and mental fatigue. Lastly, the fact that no help is in sight and that the landscape is barren affects his morale, making the journey feel insurmountable and isolating him in his struggle. These environmental factors collectively challenge his resolve and physical endurance throughout the ride.
1224	7204	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they directly change the cyclist’s mood and perception towards the ride. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon."" The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were desperately thirsty and the monotonous ride was very boring. This mental tactic makes the ride seem larger and more daunting, so it also makes it harder to ride from a psychological perspective. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps,"" which affected the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he couldn’t drink the water, his thirst intensified since he was running out of water and the disappointment was crushing. Conversely, when the cyclist notices the Welch’s grape juice factory in the distance, he became determined to get there, his spirits lifting with a new goal. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie finds that his mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting’s features, which alternately dishearten and motivate him."
1225	7205	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, both physically and mentally. When he was going up a steep hill, the incline made it significantly harder for him to pedal, sapping his strength. The hot summer day was breaking him down, the relentless sun leaching his energy and will. He was getting dangerously dehydrated because he had only a little bit of water left in his bottle, a constant source of anxiety. It said he was trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state, a difficult task that required immense concentration. He felt like giving up, his resolve weakened by the cumulative hardships of the environment, but he pressed on despite the overwhelming urge to stop.
1226	7206	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, primarily through the intense heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” Knowing that California is often called “the sunshine state”, one can infer that the temperature was very high. Another feature that significantly affected the cyclist was the poor quality of the available water; when he finally found some, it was hot and tasted like battery acid, as described in paragraph @NUM2. These harsh environmental conditions directly impacted his physical state and his journey, demonstrating how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout his ordeal.
1227	7207	3	3	The setting features affected the cyclist by creating a significant conflict for him. It was a conflict primarily because of the oppressive heat and the fact that he was lost. The heat presented a conflict because it increased his need for water, yet he had only a limited supply, which he could not replenish because he did not know where to find more. The heat causes people to get thirsty quickly, but he was unable to drink freely due to his limited water reserves. Another major conflict was that he was lost, which was a problem because he needed to be somewhere specific and his inability to find his way exacerbated his dangerous situation. These intertwined conflicts created by the setting posed a serious challenge to the cyclist's well-being and progress.
1228	7208	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist as he rode through the heat-scorching desert of California. He rode over @NUM1 miles on his bike to get to Yosemite, a journey defined by the harsh, arid environment. The extreme conditions led to him almost running out of water, which was a constant source of anxiety. However, what kept him going through this difficult trek was the vivid thought and eventual sight of the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. This envisioned destination served as his motivation, providing a mental refuge from the physical hardships imposed by the desert setting and ultimately driving him forward.
1229	7209	3	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the “short cut” that the old men give him, he is filled with confidence. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town, he does not fret but continues on his journey with that same initial confidence. As he got to the second stop, his lack of water began to set in, illustrated when he says, “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength.” This shows he will work hard and is in desperate need of water. After the cyclist passed another place with no hope of water, he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst. When he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water, he found one last drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot, harsh setting, it ultimately created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times to survive.
1230	7210	3	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people in the town anywhere, creating a profound sense of isolation. This emptiness meant that there was no help available from anyone, and he could die without anyone knowing. Also, the setting seems to be very dry and have desert-like conditions; without water, the cyclist would become dehydrated and could potentially suffer from a heat stroke. Furthermore, the setting seems to be very hot. The heat also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and causes him to mentally consider the logic and very real possibility of a heat stroke at the time, impacting both his body and his mind.
1231	7211	3	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist, creating a series of obstacles that slowed him down throughout his journey. The oppressive heat had been a major factor, slowing him down because he didn’t have enough water to keep his body moving normally, leading to dehydration and fatigue. The animals he encountered also posed a problem, as he said he had to slow down and sneak around a snake so it wouldn’t bite him, causing delays and requiring cautious movement. Furthermore, the hills had significantly affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to pedal up an incline, especially when he said he couldn't see anything in sight, which added a psychological burden to the physical challenge. Each element of the environment worked against his progress, demonstrating how a harsh setting can directly impede a journey.
1232	7212	3	3	The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert profoundly affected the cyclist during his arduous journey to Yosemite in the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist’s expedition was consistently hindered due to many formidable obstacles presented by the landscape. The extreme dryness was a huge and persistent problem during his journey, as the quote, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1), effectively illustrates the hot, arid climate he was cycling through. This unforgiving climate substantially decreased the rate of travel the cyclist had intended to exert, sapping his strength with its relentless heat. Since the cyclist was riding through the vast desert, there weren't many towns present to offer respite. When the cyclist did finally approach a town, it was invariably abandoned and desolate, offering no relief; “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me” (@NUM2). After riding for hours through the barren desert, the cyclist would have desperately wanted a nice rest stop, but all he found were ghost towns that deepened his isolation. To compound his difficulties, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn't enough of a challenge on its own; now the flat land was replaced with energy-sapping hills. The cyclist, already exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with, found that the rough terrain further affected his journey since his pace was drastically reduced by the arduous climbs. In conclusion, many interconnected factors negatively affected the cyclist's expedition to Yosemite, as the dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert collectively hindered his journey at every turn.
1233	7213	3	3	I believe the setting of an area can profoundly affect the mind when a person is put in certain situations, shaping their emotional state and perception of safety. In the reading, the man is cycling and he sees no one for miles; he is almost out of water and can't see a house or a person as far as he can see, which creates a profound sense of vulnerability. This isolation is inherently scary and gives the feeling of helplessness, as there is no immediate source of aid or comfort. However, if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street, and buildings, he would undoubtedly be calmer, knowing help and resources are readily available. He could easily get water at any building along his ride, and the cooler temperature there would mean he would drink less and potentially travel further without the same level of distress. This stark contrast in environments would have completely changed his mood, proving that the physical setting is a powerful determinant of psychological well-being during a challenging endeavor.
1234	7214	3	3	Well in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limits” by @PERSON1, the setting affects you psychologically because if you can't see anything for miles and you are running out of water, it has a profound psychological effect on your state of mind. You can start to panick, just like he did when he stopped at the old house and all that came out of the rusted water pump was battery acid, dashing his hopes for relief. Also, you don't know exactly where you are, so that also affects you because you don’t know where to go or if you should turn back or what decision is the safest. The uncertainty and isolation feed anxiety and fear. If I was this person, the desolate features around me would have a lot of effect on me, influencing my thoughts and actions significantly. The environment's emptiness directly creates a sense of dread and confusion that is hard to overcome.
1235	7215	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, primarily by dictating his emotional journey from optimism to despair. In the beginning of the essay, she was happy and optimistic that she was getting a shortcut, stating, ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a ‘shortcut’ that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” He thought he knew where he was going, a confidence reflected in the line, ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" However, when she entered the first deserted town, the sight was troubling, signaling the beginning of his troubles. The narrator describes getting “down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength,” showing she was beginning to get worried as she started to run out of water, pinning her hopes on the next town which was “only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now entering a dehydrated and fatigued state, as “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" intensifying his desperation. Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed dramatically; he was now upset and genuinely expecting to die in the harsh landscape. His salvation came when he then saw an open store, “Gary and Wilber's fish camp,” where he went in, drank cool water, and regained his composure. He then wisely decided to use his own map for the remainder of the journey, rather than relying on the advice of the old guys, learning to trust his own resources over shortcuts through unforgiving terrain."
1236	7216	3	3	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water, which was a constant and pressing issue. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right, clouding his judgment. It had also made the cyclist have less energy, slowing his pace considerably. An example is, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Another significant feature is the heat. The intense heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty, exacerbating his physical strain. An example is “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” A further example is, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways, creating a challenging and arduous journey.
1237	7217	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terrain, which was very hot and there were no trees to provide shade from the relentless sun. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty, leading to significant physical discomfort. So he drank more water than usual, depleting his supply at a faster rate. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated and weak. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration and sense of isolation. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink, which was a tremendous relief. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park, restoring his determination.
1238	7218	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist’s journey even longer and more strenuous than it otherwise would have been. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help, as services were scarce. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions they gave were horrible and confusing. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned, offering no real refuge. Another major factor was the rough terrain. It being difficult for the cyclist who was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together, demanding constant effort. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a hot summer day and he being on a bicycle which had no air conditioning (but which bike does) did not help at all, adding to his discomfort. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey, compounding the difficulty at every stage.
1239	7219	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it through each section. For example, when the terrain turned to steep hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy and strength. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey and could maintain a better pace. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water, conserving his vital resources. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, directly influencing his physical exertion and resource consumption.
1240	7220	3	3	He wouldn't know what challenges he would be facing while riding on the road; perhaps something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike’s wheels could break. Alternatively, he might fall off his the bike, or he would get so tired that he can’t go any more and he might give it up entirely. These unforeseen difficulties posed a constant threat to the success and safety of his journey, making it a truly unpredictable endeavor.
1241	7221	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by defining the need and comfort of riding. When there is no infrastructure around and no people, he can ride down in the best mood; it is nice and calm with no cars, and it is just him and the beautiful sky to ride with. In contrast, if there is infrastructure present, he must watch for people and cars and pay attention to streetsigns and act accordingly. So that outing illustrates how the specific features of the setting would affect the cyclist's entire experience and state of mind.
1242	7222	3	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what develops the character but also what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physically because his body desperately needs water, a resource of which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think you are going to die without water, you start to panic and lose control over yourself. This demonstrates the powerful and direct impact the environment has on both his physical condition and his mental fortitude."
1243	7223	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. There were many elements in his environment that shaped his journey, from the quality of the roads to the availability of essential resources like water. These conditions directly influenced his physical stamina and his mental outlook, creating challenges that he had to constantly navigate. Ultimately, the setting was not just a backdrop but an active force that dictated the pace and difficulty of his ride.
1244	7224	3	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most of the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn’t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by brackish water that tasted like battery acid.'' You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell when he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake.'' The narrator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrator face these challenging settings and showing how he felt about them, conveying a consistent sense of letdown.
1245	7225	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the route that the cyclist was taking had a rough road for him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadn’t left their porches for decades. Also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice that the advice the old men had given him was bad advice; the cyclist was headed to Yosemite and he had gotten some advice from these locals which led him astray. This poor guidance, a feature of the human landscape, combined with the difficult physical path, significantly complicated his trip and affected his progress.
1246	7226	3	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, as he had plenty of water to sustain him. As he kept going, and sort of got off course, he began to come into the vast and barren desert region. He was hot under the relentless sun, and he was running out of his precious water supply. This depletion was making him dangerously dehydrated, weakening his body. Also, seeing the endless tumbleweeds rolling across the landscape, and the complete lack of vibrant vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that desolate place. When he saw the fish bait shop though, he was probably profoundly relieved, believing that he was finally going to be saved from his dire circumstances. This sequence of events clearly illustrates the profound impact of the environment on his journey.
1247	7227	3	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is a short smooth path the ride will be easy and enjoyable. But if it is a long journey on bumpy, rough roads it will be significantly harder to control the bike, demanding constant physical effort and focus, which means that the cyclist’s job will be hardened considerably. This is how a cyclist is fundamentally affected by his or her settings, with the terrain directly dictating the difficulty of the ride.
1248	7228	3	3	The cyclist ran into a series of rough settings on the way to the park. The first challenge was that the town he came to was a complete ghost town, empty and silent. Then he was running out of water when he rode past dry tumbleweeds, and encountered a large snake coiled in front of him, blocking his path. He had no more water to drink and there were rough roads ahead of him, straining his endurance. He then came across a juice factory, a potential source of relief. However, no one was there to help him and he was out of water, so he did not know how much longer it would be until he came to another town. That is why I say that the specific features of the setting critically affected the cyclist throughout his difficult trip.
1249	7229	3	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men, the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was completely deserted. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist’s water supply was dwindling rapidly because there was no place where he could get more water to replenish it. He became severely dehydrated and kept pushing himself forward, desperate to find a place where there was fresh water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Once he found some pebbles and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn’t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have profoundly negative thoughts. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Because the setting was a hot, deserted, and arid desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist’s physical and mental state. If he hadn’t been running out of water I don’t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the harsh effects of the environment much worse, pushing him to his absolute limit.
1250	7230	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several key ways. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehydrate, which posed a serious health risk. Also, the constant searching for water slowed him down more, delaying his progress. Another reason I say this is because the man at the start gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused, leading him into a difficult and barren area. That is how the various elements of the setting ultimately affected the cyclist’s journey and well-being.
1251	7231	3	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for instinct."" This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him along the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that hinders him in the story. Because he listened to some old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant exercise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adept at recognizing the signs of his environment through experience. A similar story to this is Jack London's, “To Build a Fire” where the man is also pitted against extremes of nature through the Yukon, but the elements still overtook him. Both stories represent man's quest for adventure, and also the constant struggle for survival that people face, demonstrating that nature's power can overwhelm even the prepared."
1252	7232	3	3	The features of a setting can affect a cyclist's energy. In a setting with steep hills and rough terrain, it can wear the cyclist out. The constant effort required to climb and navigate such a landscape drains physical stamina and mental resolve. This exhaustion is a direct result of the environmental challenges, which demand more from the rider than a flat, smooth path would. Ultimately, the difficult setting saps the cyclist's strength, leaving them fatigued and struggling to maintain their pace.
1253	7233	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most in the fact that it strained him out of his hydrated state. The relentless heat and arid conditions rapidly depleted his body's moisture, making him unable to operate at his full power and efficiency. This physical depletion was critical; the environment actively deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with, accelerating his decline. That is how the setting affected him, by directly attacking his physical resources and diminishing his capacity to function.
1254	7234	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert heat with no available water causes him to get dangerously dehydrated. Furthermore, the rolling hills and rough, unforgiving terrain physically tire him out, compounding his distress. In the story it says “and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This shows that the intense heat and demanding terrain could cause him to overheat and suffer a heat stroke. The combination of these environmental factors creates a severe threat to his well-being, demonstrating the powerful influence of the setting on his physical state.
1255	7235	3	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The high temperature caused the cyclist to sweat profusely. This affected him because he would get intensely thirsty and eventually he ran out of water, leaving him without a way to replenish his fluids. For example, in the text he says “the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and then it goes on to say, “I could drop from from a heat stroke.” This showed how it affected him because he genuinely feared he was going to collapse from the oppressive heat, highlighting the direct and dangerous impact of the temperature on his body and mind.
1256	7236	3	3	"The features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the harsh and hot climate and the unforgiving terrain. The author clearly wrote how ""the sun was beating down on him"" and how he ""almost died from dehydration,"" emphasizing the relentless heat that sapped his energy and the arid landscape that offered no respite. This combination of environmental factors created a severe challenge for his journey, pushing him to his physical limits. Ultimately, the setting proved to be a formidable adversary that nearly cost him his life."
1257	7237	3	3	The features of the setting do significantly affect the cyclist, demanding constant preparation and awareness. If the road is rough, you have to have the right bike to handle the uneven surface. Then, if you get a flat tire, you have to know to look out for dangerous and poisonous things like snakes or thorny plants while making repairs. If you were in a real bad accident, you’d have to be prepared with supplies just in case they don’t find you in time. You would also have to know what nights were like in that environment. For example, if it got real cold at night after a hot day, you would need to find a way to keep yourself warm to survive. This constant vigilance is essential for safety in such a demanding setting.
1258	7238	3	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist, presenting multiple physical challenges. The desert in June must have been very hot, and going up those steep hills had to be hard, requiring immense physical exertion. The road was also very rough, as indicated by the sign, “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The narrative confirms the location with, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather, his water supply insufficient for the conditions. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist, testing his endurance at every turn.
1259	7239	3	3	"The cyclist’s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippled him as he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water, making his desperate situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat, he became exhausted, dehydrated, and began fearing heat stroke and loss of consciousness. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke"" and, ""It looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time."" These fears highlight how the environment directly threatened his very survival."
1260	7240	3	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot summer day. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to pass by deserted towns, noting, “This place might have been a thriving little spot...a ghost town.” The terrain was threatening because after twenty-two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome “short rolling hills,” which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping, intensifying his dehydration. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the treacherous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to the lack of water and the difficult terrain he had to overcome.
1261	7241	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by teasing him in a cruel progression. First it was the rippling streams glimpsed from the road that taunted his thirst with their inaccessible flow, then the old faucet that stood as a silent mockery of relief, and last the Welches grape factory, a monument to past abundance. The streams were the beginning stage, simply provoking a deep thirst, then came the faucet, which was broken and yielded nothing. The faucet made him realize fully that he was dehydrated and without a ready source of aid. And last the abandoned Welches grape juice factory, with its faded signs of juicy refreshment, had him almost abandon hope entirely as he passed by. The setting was profoundly effecting his mood, pushing him toward despair with each successive landmark.
1262	7242	3	3	The features of the setting directly affect the cyclist in the story, primarily through the scarcity of water and the isolating landscape. In the story, it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.” This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scarce, highlighting a critical threat to his survival. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn’t get water, showing his desperation. Another example is that there are no buildings around and the area is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads, which deepens his solitude. In the story it says, “the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This means that he was partially all by himself in a challenging environment and he had no one to go to for assistance, making his journey a solitary struggle against the elements.
1263	7243	3	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist, creating a complex experience. Certain features portray that this “journey” to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable in brief moments. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can occasionally enjoy riding the bike because there is a cooling breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty, which directly impacts his well-being. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more, as described by, “A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.” This shows the dirtiness of the water and its unsuitability for drinking. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive the harsh conditions. It says “working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength,” which portrays the sacrifice and bravery of the cyclist in the face of adversity."
1264	7244	3	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist, shaping both her physical and mental state. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry, desert conditions. “I was traveling the high deserts of California in June” This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a reliable source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using her own strength to get up and down hills, and to navigate past plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak; she was forced on a low supply of water and had to dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living, confirming her isolation. There was nobody around her to help, which intensified her struggle. The setting led to her deteriorating health, as her physical state was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to ware, evidenced when she had to shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story was real."
1265	7245	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist throughout his journey. Because the man didn’t have a lot of water and he was going into the California deserts in June, the heat was an immediate and pressing danger. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills, increasing the physical demand, and up ahead there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” where the speed limit was notably low, warning of the difficult path to come. One more thing is to make sure you don’t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn’t been off his porch in decades, as his advice may be outdated and misleading for the current conditions. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist, demonstrating how the environment and its elements directly challenge his progress and decisions.
1266	7246	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist since it is affecting her physical condition. She needs water to survive, and the next town is very far away. So she could possibly pass out without a break, and the hot temperatures exacerbate her dehydration. ìWhen I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acidî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). If she doesnít find water soon, it will affect her condition severely. Also, the features of the setting affects her mental determination. When she knows that she needs to find a town, she works harder. ""i would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so atleast or my inner spirit""(@NUM1). She would try her hardest to make smart moves, and make it to a town, as fast as possible. She works harder since she knows without water, her life is in danger. Now, things could get even rougher on the challenging path ahead."
1267	7247	3	3	"During the cyclist's journey in ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie, he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When he's riding he says the road is initially flat. ìFlat road was replaced"" This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat, allowing for easy travel. Then as he's riding he notices the land change.î Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.î this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed, introducing new physical demands. Thatís how the land changes and impacts his ride, making his progress more difficult and strenuous over time."
1268	7248	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist directly. The setting affects the cyclist because itís real hot and inhospitable. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips werenít really short cuts at all. So now heís riding and angry that he took their advice. Also heís running out of water and becoming dangerously dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with a water pump, but in order to get it you need to pump it manually. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk come out. He pumps for about @NUM1 minutes to cool the water, but it doesnít cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid, so he cannot drink it. So he starts riding again, but soon encounters a snake on the path. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that heís about to die and regrets listening to men who havenít got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure of their directions. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there desperately. Now itís a fishing store and he drinks lots and lots of water, finally finding relief. He also says heís never listening to old men again and heíll always use the map from now on to navigate his journey.
1269	7249	3	3	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming and more desolate. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump & an old shed, which offer little help. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all, making it undrinkable. When the cyclist continues her journey, tumble weeds that look like ìdiamond head snakesî cross her path, adding to the unsettling environment. She encounters no buildings for a long time, and when she does encounter a building, it is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the harsh landscape. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journy but decides not to take his advice because of the disastrous path the last set of elderly men set her down, learning from her past mistakes in this unforgiving setting.
1270	7250	3	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from his/her performance in several ways. For example, In the essay ìRough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending constantly. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has, draining their stamina. Also, the lack of people in towns gives the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate under the intense sun. Third, the weather in the essay has a great deal of effect on the cyclist; it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride through such a demanding environment. These combined factors create a significant challenge for the cyclist's journey.
1271	7251	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, such as the oppressive heat, the lack of available water, and the challenging hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said the warm sips he managed to take tasted ìlike battery acid.î The desperation grew as the landscape offered no respite, and he had to convince himself to push up the road for another @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself at a distant store he hoped to find. This arduous segment of the trip highlighted how deeply the environment can impact a traveler's physical and mental state, ultimately teaching a lesson about preparation and endurance.
1272	7253	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by hurting his ability to keep going, presenting a series of demoralizing challenges. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems that tested his resolve. At first he took advice from a very old man who had out of date directions, leading him astray. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply, a miscalculation that soon took its toll. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry as the sun beat down relentlessly. His spirits were briefly lifted when he found an old building which raised his hopes, only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown, with no help to be found. Finally he finds a store and quenches his dehydration and is on his way again, having narrowly overcome the obstacles posed by his surroundings.
1273	7254	3	3	I think features affect the cyclist because when you undertake a bicycle journey you need to consider the environmental conditions you will face. The terrain and climate are not just background details but active elements that can dictate the success or failure of the trip. A cyclist must constantly adapt to these features, which directly influence their stamina, route choices, and overall experience. Understanding this relationship is crucial for any successful journey, as the setting is an inseparable part of the cycling adventure.
1274	7255	3	3	"In the story ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist has a very long journey that is affected by a variety of things, and problems that test his initial confidence. The cyclist is confident with himself at the beginning but after a few moments he feels really bad, and learns a really good lesson about his own limits. ìI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water, his body weakening with every pedal stroke. This quote shows that he is not only thirsty but dehydrated which is severe for a human being, impairing his physical coordination. The cyclist also had a really bad time, because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away, one example of that is when he succumbed to a desperate, ancient trick, finding only dust and disappointment. This entire ordeal underscores the profound impact of the setting on a traveler's well-being and decision-making."
1275	7256	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journey to Yosemite, which shapes his entire experience. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals, a error that compounds his difficulties. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist, dictating his struggles. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, ìtraveling through the high deserts of California in June,î immediately establishing a harsh environment. Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated, his energy sapped. Along with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,î demanding greater physical exertion. This setting is a major setback to the cyclistís journey, and required him to persevere through the unexpected hardships. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through, mirroring this cyclical struggle. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came, altering our plans completely. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best out of it, adapting to the new conditions. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting, which was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself and my companions. In both situations, perseverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey, proving that overcoming environmental challenges brings its own unique reward.
1276	7257	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are bumpy and uneven, causing a jarring and uncomfortable ride. The other thing that is affecting the cyclist is the water on the roads, which creates a slick and hazardous surface that threatens his stability. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed, forcing him to brake frequently and expend more energy to navigate the constant turns. These combined elements create a demanding and strenuous journey for the rider, testing his endurance and control over the bicycle at every stage.
1277	7258	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly. The setting is described as a rough terrain, which makes it harder for the cyclist to travel, with rocks and ruts jolting his bicycle. Also it’s hot, with a relentless sun beating down, and there are no buildings or people around to offer any respite. This also makes it hard for the cyclist because he runs out of water, leaving him dehydrated and fatigued. Throughout the story the cyclist keeps going, pushing through the adversity, and ends up surviving the harsh journey against the odds, a testament to his sheer determination.
1278	7259	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is so negative and bleak. Everything around the cyclist is perceived negatively, so naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature; since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. The vast, monotonous landscape offers no visual relief or encouragement. Also the cyclist feels like he can’t go on and is weak because there is no living thing around him, intensifying his sense of isolation. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier, highlighting how profoundly the environment shapes his mental state and perceived effort.
1279	7260	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making it hard for him to control his bike down on the rough road, with the constant vibrations straining his arms. The hotter temperature was making him thirsty and led to him running out of water, which became a serious concern. Also there wasn't a building in sight so he could not get anything to drink, leaving him without any source of replenishment. Also he did not know where he was going, as the featureless landscape provided no landmarks for navigation. These are the key features that affected the cyclist, creating a situation of physical discomfort and navigational uncertainty that challenged his entire ride.
1280	7261	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in many grueling and harsh ways. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling of isolation and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill battles are taking their toll on both the cyclist's physical and mental strength, sapping his energy with every pedal stroke. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming rate due to his thirst and the relentless heat, compounding his physical distress. In paragraph four the exhausted cyclist reaches the first ""town."" This place might have been a thriving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. He came to a house with a rusty water pump, which spewed out brackish, near boiling water, which did not support the parched cyclist, physically, or mentally, dashing his last hope for relief and leaving him in a state of complete despair as he faced the continuing journey alone."
1281	7262	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he learns to never accept travel advice from strangers without verification. The environment, with its misleading paths and isolated terrain, teaches him a hard lesson about self-reliance. This experience fundamentally changes his approach to navigation and trust in unfamiliar places. Ultimately, the cyclist's ordeal underscores the importance of preparing for a journey with reliable information, ensuring he is never again led astray by well-meaning but inaccurate directions.
1282	7263	3	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination, only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the ìhigh deserts of California in June,î the harsh landscape took its toll. With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated, saying ìIíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,"" shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated ìI had an overwhelming and buy some bait,"" showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water, a moment that highlighted his profound physical and mental exhaustion."
1283	7264	3	3	"In the story ìDo not exceed posted speed limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the intense heat and strenuous exercise will quickly dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This act of desperation clearly illustrates how the unforgiving desert environment directly challenges his survival and dictates his actions. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."
1284	7265	3	3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite, thinking, ìThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.î The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building, ìÖtelling myself that if I could make it that far, Iíd be fine.î After many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones, ìÖslowly gaining elevation while losing hope.î When the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had ìan overwhelming urge to seek out the proprietor, kiss them, and buy some bait.î At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map, having learned a valuable lesson about preparation.
1285	7266	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an ìGhost townî with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he could find was utterly undrinkable, leaving him in a perilous and desperate situation that tested his limits.
1286	7267	3	3	Well, some features of the setting might have had a greater impact than others, and the cyclist might have been more affected by certain challenges. Also, the author faced a lot of problems during the journey, such as the severe lack of water, the threat of poisonous snakes, and the poor condition of the road. These environmental factors created a series of obstacles, so there were many things that affected both the author and the cyclist when they were on their difficult journey through the harsh landscape.
1287	7268	3	3	In the passage “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that significantly affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way. For example, in the text it says, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” and “I cased post, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by presenting a sudden danger, giving him a critical point where he had to stay calm and maintain composure even in the debilitated state he was in, being dehydrated and suffering from all the other effects he encountered from that challenging environment.
1288	7269	3	3	There are many things that could have made his bicycle ride much more enjoyable; one primary thing is if he wasn’t in the middle of nowhere and if he actually knew where he was. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” emphasizing his profound isolation. Furthermore, he had almost no water to get him through the day, which is illustrated by the instance, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Consequently, he did not know where he was going, so navigating the unfamiliar terrain was much harder for him. In conclusion, these are some of the key things that made his trip particularly hard and unenjoyable.
1289	7270	3	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist in such ways, making him hallucinatory and severely dehydrated. He saw the idea that a juice factory was working, when in reality it was completely abandoned. He saw only rusty pipes, and this sight intensified his thirst because he knew on a rational level that those old, corroded pipes could never produce water. This cruel juxtaposition of his desperate need and the barren reality deeply affected his mental state during the arduous journey.
1290	7271	3	3	In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the settings of the story profoundly affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him extremely worried. In the story, the cyclist takes two old men’s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountain and gets himself lost in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, and he lets this desperate situation go to his head, as shown by the line, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” which was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water; the setting makes him nervous precisely because he was in a vast, arid desert. He wouldn’t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams and shade. He lets the desert and the intense heat convince him that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns, he believes he will never see another person again; he gets more disoriented and fearful because of where he is. He becomes convinced the heat will kill him. Thus, the setting affects him psychologically and tricks him into believing he is going to die.
1291	7272	3	3	The features of the setting, including the terrain conditions, weather, and amount of water, can critically decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as steep hills and rocky roads can decide a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself a serious injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view,” which shows the arduous conditions in which the cyclist had to deal. In addition, the extreme weather and amount of water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out from heat exhaustion and no one would find him in the vast desert. In addition, the oppressive heat isnít helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don't make a life-threating choice that could end their journey permanently.
1292	7273	3	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is in an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels completely hopeless in the abandoned town, a feeling amplified by the desolate surroundings. When he first reaches the old water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope, a brief spark of potential salvation, only to be let down cruelly. This is because the building has no juice and the water pump’s water is too hot and the water is not any good, leaving him in a state of profound disappointment. The setting is the primary reason his mood changes through out the story, shifting his spirit from determined optimism to utter dejection as each potential resource proves useless.
1293	7274	3	3	I am going to write a response that explains how the features of the setting affects the cyclist. In my response, I will include specific examples from the essay that support my conclusion, drawing directly from the text. I think the features in the setting affect the cyclist profoundly because different environmental things such as snow or rocks could affect the way someone rides, altering their balance and safety. The setting creates constant challenges that the cyclist must navigate, proving that the environment is a powerful force shaping his entire experience and ultimately determining the outcome of his difficult journey.
1294	7275	3	3	In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along his ride he meets some old but confident men who seem knowledgeable. They tell him a new rout wich “was to slice away hours” from his ride; the setting was excedingly hot on that particular day. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way, but the first was a “baren ghost town,” the next had water with “the flavor of battery acid,” and then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory, finding no relief. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he finally reached a baite shop where he could recover. The advice that he gives to his readers, born from this difficult experience, is to stick to your guns & don’t let old timers try and change your mind about a planned route.
1295	7276	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many changes due to the setting of what was around him. The cyclist was lost in the dessert, a vast and unforgiving landscape. This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot and exposed. He could have died from either severe dehydration or sheer exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous; on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake slithering across his path. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldn’t have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in also happened to be completely desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions or offer assistance. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water, his most vital resource. Without the water, he could become very weak and dehydrated and could have even died from the harsh conditions. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly, dictating his every struggle.
1296	7277	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him desperately thirsty and leading him to believe he is lost and might perish in the heat. Following outdated information from an old man who had not left his porch for years, the cyclist felt his hope dwindling. Just when the cyclist thought he was irrevocably lost, he saw the sign for “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp—if you want bait for the big ones, we're your best bet!” The cyclist went inside the camp, where he gratefully obtained water to quench his thirst. The old man inside offered him directions, but this time, having learned from his previous misadventure, the cyclist wisely declined the offer and continued on his own way.
1297	7278	3	3	"In the short story “Do not exceed the speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has a great impact on the cyclist. In the beginning of the story he describes the scenery as a vast, arid landscape. As he continued following the old men's outdated advice, it led him through more barren and desolate lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town, empty and silent. The second setting he arrived at was “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule.” He continued moving to the next town, which was many miles away, and he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bottling plant, which turned out to be another disappointment. This took a toll on his confidence because he said, ""I hung my head,"" feeling defeated. He moved on and had finally arrived at an abandoned building called “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp.” This is where he drank water and became replenished. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist because, depending on the location, it decided whether he would live or die in the hot deserts of California, making his journey a matter of survival."
1298	7279	3	3	One of the main things that affect the cyclist is the oppressive heat. Due to the intense heat, he drinks all of his water supply very quickly, leaving him vulnerable. Another feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the rough road, which includes steep hills and uneven surfaces. Since he is so tired from the journey, he has a difficult time riding on these hills and navigating the other hard road conditions, which further saps his energy and slows his progress through the challenging environment.
1299	7280	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, “Flat roads were replaced by short, riding hills,” and as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and carefree, and the land was flat with no hills. However, once he noticed that everything was not as the men had said, he seemed to grow a little angry and upset. Just like the land seemed to reflect this, he soon found himself on a bumpy and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on his adventure; “tumbleweeds crossed my path [and] a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front of me.” The land seemed to be teasing and tormenting him, especially when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake, creating a direct parallel between his internal state and the external world.
1300	7281	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy. He is sweating so much in the heat that he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it, yet still has a long ride ahead of him. As the text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Since it was so hot, the cyclist was constantly thirsty and drank all of his water, leaving him with a dire shortage. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated, but the environment was working against him, consuming his resources and his stamina in equal measure.
1301	7282	3	3	In the book “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting was in the small, dusty town of Codi, California. The author went on a challenging journey through this arid landscape, embarking on a bicycle trip that would test his endurance and resolve as he pedaled across the sun-scorched terrain.
1302	7283	3	3	Throughout the rider's long journey, the setting greatly affected him. For example, the relentless hot weather caused him to drink the majority of his water supply far too quickly, making him dangerously dehydrated and profoundly tired. If the weather had been cool and forgiving, he would have conserved his energy and his water, and he would have lasted much longer on the difficult path that stretched out before him.
1303	7284	3	3	"In this story the cyclist was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained a boost of confidence because he believed that he was finally on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man felt. Finally, when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankful because he no longer had death blazing towards him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and an empty water bottle. This was how the various features and the changing setting affected him in many ways throughout his arduous trip."
1304	7285	3	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts with no water, a cyclist was on a difficult journey. While riding through a small town, he asked for directions. The two old men he encountered gave him the wrong directions and sent him on a trip through hell that only a truly determined person could get through. First he had to go many miles without water, which resulted in him losing faith, becoming dehydrated, and nearly abandoning his plans entirely. The harsh terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without any water. Luckily he had enough faith and determination so he managed to get through it and learned a valuable lesion. Maps are made for people to use, so if you have a map you should trust it, and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said, “And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.”
1305	7286	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” a lot of things affected the cyclist. Such as the rocky road that jolted his bike and body, and the critical lack of water, for example where the author says, “when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.” this shows how he was losing hope, and he seems a little scared of his deteriorating situation. Also, the abandoned towns with their empty buildings and silent streets didn’t help his growing sense of isolation and despair on the long, lonely road.
1306	7287	3	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hot out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. The dry air and lack of shade contribute to the harshness of the journey. Also, the terrain on which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy more quickly as he navigates the uneven ground. The sun was also beginning to beat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist profoundly. It causes him to dehydrate and have a desperate need for water. In the story it says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke, highlighting the direct threat posed by the setting.
1307	7288	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by depleting his water supply, and almost giving him heat exhaustion. The relentless desert sun and high temperatures accelerate his dehydration, forcing him to consume his limited water reserves. In the text, he says: “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This shows the severity of his situation, where the intense heat has left him with little water left for survival until he runs out completely. His physical state deteriorates as a direct result of the environmental conditions, pushing him toward a dangerous brink. The setting, therefore, acts as a primary antagonist, creating a life-threatening scenario through its harsh and unforgiving nature.
1308	7289	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had “a smile on.” This initial ease allowed for a pleasant and effortless ride. Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue the arduous climb. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle over the unstable and bumpy ground. As if the rough terrain wasn’t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play, presenting new and demanding obstacles. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist, demonstrating how the physical landscape directly dictates the level of effort and difficulty he must endure throughout his journey.
1309	7290	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if they're going down hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike and maintain balance. If they're going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill to navigate the difficult path and maintain momentum. Usually if they're riding in a shady area then they wear clothes to keep them cool, as the environment is more forgiving. But if they're going to be in the sun then they need to wear light clothes to protect themselves from the heat and sun exposure. The setting affects the rider very much, dictating not only the required technique but also the necessary preparations and gear for a successful and safe ride.
1310	7291	3	3	"The setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads, creating an unexpected physical challenge. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination, facing extreme heat. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid, which rapidly worsened his condition. He started to get dehydrated and could barely keep his balance on his bike. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large"" snake – it really didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me” (Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration, combining a psychological obstacle with his physical decline. The settings in this story had an effect on the cyclist in many ways, from misleading information and harsh climate to direct physical barriers that tested his endurance and will."
1311	7292	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. Here are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels, as he states, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old man's direction, which made his journey more strenuous. The ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign is a final example of the challenging terrain. Furthermore, he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds, which startled him. ""A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" These are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story, showing the direct impact of his environment on his experience."
1312	7293	3	3	The features in the settings, like hills, make the cyclist use more energy as he pedals against the incline. The more energy that he uses, the more water he will want to drink to replenish himself. This is difficult because he states, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Therefore he was in trouble, facing the harsh reality of his dwindling supplies in the demanding landscape.
1313	7294	3	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, he is in the desert and it is very hot outside, which drains his energy. Also he is running out of water, a critical resource. This is bad because he could become dehydrated, impairing his ability to continue. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he’s pretty much dehydrated and his vision is unreliable. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water, creating a cycle of hardship. In conclusion, all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way, compounding the challenges of his journey.
1314	7295	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men’s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on through the unforgiving heat. The intense heat of the weather and his lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter about his own well-being. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him, showing his profound despair. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his own knowledge is best, marking a return to his confident self.
1315	7296	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has a long ride. Where he is riding there is up and down hills, testing his endurance, and also the road is very rough, jostling him constantly. He was running out of water in the desert, a serious predicament. “I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out.” Now that he is off his bike he least worries about the poisonous snakes of the desert, as his immediate concern is his thirst. He found Welch’s grape juice factory but it was abandoned, offering no respite. Ultimately, the author found a bait shop and got water, finally securing the resource he so desperately needed to continue his arduous trek.
1316	7297	3	3	In the short story “Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story profoundly affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many drastic changes in temperature and climate, from the cool shade of pines to the oppressive heat of the desert. He also experiences significant changes in land structure, such as encountering steep hills and rough terrain, which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning, this constant physical challenge imposed by the environment is why the setting @MONTH1 so powerfully affect the cyclist and his progress.
1317	7298	3	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affecting the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him relentlessly and is making it harder for him to reach his destination, as illustrated when he observes, “The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” By him being so hot and tired from the sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration before arriving. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn’t help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was “water depleting @NUM2,” leaving him vulnerable to the harsh conditions.
1318	7299	3	3	The various features of the setting does significantly affect the cyclist during his journey. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal to avoid dehydration under the scorching sun. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful to navigate slippery roads and maintain control. The physical landscape itself, whether flat or mountainous, directly influences the effort required to pedal. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist in these fundamental and challenging ways.
1319	7300	3	3	"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways, both positively and negatively. For instance if you are hot, a tree could provide shade, or if thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot and desperate. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, “ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,” this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph, offering a temporary respite. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst and anxiety. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how environmental features can have direct and powerful effects on a person's physical state and morale."
1320	7301	3	3	"The features of the setting stronger, effect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite in multiple ways. The features of the land;in, and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of june also effect this story and its protagonist. The dry and hills land is a huge factor for the main character. Because if is hilly, he has to work twice as hard to climb each incline. The land is dry, so he his thirsty and has no where to get anything to drink, exacerbating his physical strain. The land is also desert, so there is no where he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization, leading to isolation. He believes that he is not going to make it, a feeling captured in the text which explains in paragraph !!, "" the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a goregous day on June simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh"" The setting plays a huge role in the story. It is hot, dry, and deserted this out effects the main character and his entire journey, defining the central conflict."
1321	7302	3	3	"The cyclist in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit"" feels discouraged and dehydrated because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broken buildings and some rusted pumps, he states, “This sight was troubling.” He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds they produce “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water,” which deepens his sense of despair. Also, as he is pedaling through the barren landscape, he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour, a speed that feels cruelly ironic given his slow, arduous pace. He is thus profoundly impacted by the desolate environment surrounding him."
1322	7303	3	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels. “The sun was beginning to beat down,” (Kurmaskie) and he is starting to get tired because it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident about his journey. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (Kurmaskie), a time known for extreme heat. Not only is he very tired and hot, but where he is riding is barren and open, and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water, increasing his isolation. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cyclist can change how and why he does what he does, ultimately dictating his physical and mental state.
1323	7304	3	3	The essay explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting are significant because the cyclist's experience is directly shaped by them. The support for this conclusion is found in the cyclist's own reactions and descriptions throughout the text. The setting, therefore, is a powerful force that influences the cyclist's journey from start to finish.
1324	7305	3	3	The scenery makes the cyclist happy. He is so happy as he rides through the beautiful landscape, feeling a sense of joy and freedom. The pleasant surroundings lift his spirits immensely, making his journey a delightful experience. Woohoo! He is truly happy.
1325	7306	3	3	In this story the setting has a profound affect on the cyclist's trip and to him self. It is hot and over one hundred degrees and he is going down hill with a lot of turns, which adds physical strain to the oppressive heat. The cyclist is getting so hot that his water is no longer cold, offering little relief. Being in this desert is killing him and about to make him have a heatstroke, pushing him to his absolute limit. All the things in the desert, from the relentless sun to the isolated terrain, are doing a lot to affect the cyclist, demonstrating the environment's powerful role in his ordeal.
1326	7307	3	3	"The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in the story ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part, until the directions he was given by “a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the men’s directions, the setting was enjoyable and made for an easy ride; a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” This confidence begins to deplete as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says “sometimes life can feel so cruel” after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn’t even reach that limit. However, he’s determined and pushes through to reach a shop, which gives a sense of satisfaction and renewed confidence. So in conclusion, the setting can have a powerful affect on a person's mood or motivation."
1327	7308	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him feel isolated and weary, which are evident in scenes like when he rode through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story, and that is all the narrative seems to talk about. The descriptions of him getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road emphasize the harshness of his journey. He was always thirsty and rode his bike a long way, and there is no paint on the old, weathered signs he passes, showing the desolation of the area. These environmental details consistently work to shape his difficult experience on the road.
1328	7309	3	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much describes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong legs and a smile on his face, full of optimism. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town; that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he just laughs it off. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. At the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it is starting to get hotter, but that doesn’t change his mood much. Several miles later he comes to a fork in the road with rusty water pumps and a rundown car; all that makes him less confident in his water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away, so he loses more confidence and gets more worried about his water supply. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road, so his mood goes down more as the physical challenge increases. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and gets water, so his spirits go way up with this relief. This progression clearly shows how the setting directly affected his mood throughout the trip.
1329	7310	3	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke, which illustrates the extreme conditions. Also his lack of water made him extremely tired as he pedaled, sapping his strength. Next the sun was beating down, so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was losing water and energy from his sweat. The combination of heat, dehydration, and physical exertion created a vicious cycle. That is why the features and setting made his journey to Yosemite so difficult and taxing.
1330	7311	3	3	In the short story, “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist experiences some difficult times due to his environment. When starting the journey he had very little water to begin with, which was a major problem. Because it was so hot and dry his water went quickly, leaving him with very little for the rest of the trip and causing great concern. The rough roads also made him tired, making it harder to make the journey as the difficult terrain demanded more effort. These environmental challenges combined to test his endurance and resolve throughout the ride.
1331	7312	3	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are “the cool pines and rushing rivers”; they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the scenery and the temperature, providing a brief respite from his arduous journey. Another is the juice factory, and it was old and shut down, showing that he would die alone, a stark symbol of abandonment. The ghost town which was completely and utterly deserted shows that the place is barren and unlivable, offering no refuge or resources. These are some of the features that affect the biker, shaping his experience through both refreshing and desolate landscapes.
1332	7313	3	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In “Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion, a testament to his growing exhaustion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill, draining his remaining strength. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist, compounding his physical struggle with mental despair.
1333	7314	3	3	Heat, desert, humidity – all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, “… water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.” This means that the day is hot and running out of water, intensifying his desperation. Second, desert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually deserted. For example the narrator exclaims “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a desert where no one wants to be, emphasizing his profound isolation. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is, adding another layer of physical discomfort. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey, each element contributing to his ordeal.
1334	7315	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers “shortcut” as he states that “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” But what he didn’t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first “town” which was a ghost town. He wasn’t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how “a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake, heightening the sense of danger. He was now fearing a heat stroke, his body pushed to its absolute limit. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head in defeat. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike ride. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink, saving himself from collapse. So this ride was torturous due to the setting, a harrowing journey shaped by the unforgiving environment.
1335	7316	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn’t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1∞, dashing his hopes for relief. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn’t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills, sapping his remaining vigor. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water, a fortunate turn in his fortunes. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” gaining a valuable lesson from his ordeal. The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting, ultimately emerging with a hard-won insight.
1336	7317	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.” Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots, finding only dust and silence where bustling life was promised. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts, pushing his body and his bicycle through the unforgiving landscape. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all, a look of weary recognition on his face. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map, having learned a hard lesson about trusting those who are out of touch with the current state of the roads.
1337	7318	3	3	The features in the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. One of which is being only to carry so much equipment which may be needed for a long and arduous journey. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of it there are no buildings or anything around, meaning that you are out of luck and in a perilous situation. Also, you can only take so much food, which limits your energy and stamina over a long-distance ride. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can’t just pull over; you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home, a reality that adds significant pressure to the trip. I know that I would not make it through such demanding circumstances. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects a cyclist, imposing strict physical and logistical challenges that must be carefully managed.
1338	7319	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible, oppressive heat. He says “the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This means that the heat is a threat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke, a dangerous condition. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings and the evidence of abandonment. ""a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule."" He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong, increasing his sense of isolation. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink, a simple but life-saving resource. He had the “overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This means that that he is so profoundly relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it, a moment that highlights the intense impact of the setting on his emotional state."
1339	7320	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn’t have to use as much strength and pedal as hard without having as much water left in his body, offering a brief respite. When he came to a pump hoping for relief, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid, a cruel disappointment. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn’t able to get to the Yosemite water until the very end of his ordeal, prolonging his suffering. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down slightly, a small mercy in the vast heat. The features of the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie thus affect the cyclist in both helpful and harmful ways throughout his journey.
1340	7321	3	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things, shaping experiences and outcomes. In the “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day….” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The setting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue under such brutal conditions. He is very tired and almost sick from the intense, unrelenting heat. The settings of this place are hurting the cyclist and he wants to go home and away from the heat, a desire born of sheer exhaustion. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much, demonstrating the powerful role environment plays in any physical endeavor.
1341	7322	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist is that it is summer time, and it is harder for the cyclist because the intense heat of the season leads to increased physical exertion and fatigue. The high temperatures can cause discomfort and sap the cyclist's energy, making the journey more challenging than it would be in cooler weather. This demonstrates how the environmental conditions directly influence the cyclist's experience and physical state. Ultimately, the summer setting presents a significant obstacle that the cyclist must endure throughout the ride.
1342	7323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn’t have to worry about dehydration, as water sources would be readily available. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened, meaning the social environment is a direct factor in the events that unfold. These examples show how both the physical and human elements of a setting can shape the cyclist's journey. Therefore, the specific characteristics of the environment are crucial in determining the outcome of the narrative.
1343	7324	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The heat of the California desert causes the cyclist to become tired and dehydrated. For example, the narrator states, “I raced past, trying to keep my balance, a dehydrated star.” The setting is the main factor which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated, as the arid climate and relentless sun drain his body of essential fluids. This physical toll is a direct result of the harsh desert environment through which he is traveling. Consequently, the setting acts as a powerful force that directly impacts the cyclist's physical well-being.
1344	7325	3	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills that is wearing him out through constant climbing and descending. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off, leaving him completely exposed to the elements. This combination of extreme heat and demanding geography creates a profoundly difficult challenge. In the end, these environmental features work together to exhaust the cyclist both mentally and physically.
1345	7326	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher, things for the cyclist got harder. In the text, there is a sentence that says, “It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” because the road ahead got rough and to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water, and rolling hills are all obstacles in life that people have to experience. We might not like it, but the reward at the end is wonderful, showing how challenges lead to growth. Thus, the setting's difficulties serve as a metaphor for the broader struggles and eventual triumphs in life.
1346	7327	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the harsh conditions of the road and the severe weather. At one point, he hit some bad and nasty water, a deep puddle that soaked him and threatened his balance. Along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a vast desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink. He was very dehydrated and had to drink from a bottle of Neslé water he found, which was warm and unsatisfying. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad but he had to push through the pain. At one point a big snake almost took up the entire road, its coiled body blocking his path, and he had to just ease his way on by it cautiously. His riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, and he morbidly said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on, the sun beating down relentlessly. He finally found a bathroom, went inside it, drank water from the sink greedily, and yelled to a man outside who then told him the direction he wanted to go, providing a small but crucial respite.
1347	7328	3	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist profoundly. First in the story when describing the setting it says “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because he is entirely alone and vulnerable. This isolation creates a sense of impending danger. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist is when it says “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a sign that is pretty much saying danger lies ahead, something bad will happen to those who are not cautious. These environmental cues directly shape his experience and the challenges he must face on his journey, building tension throughout the narrative.
1348	7329	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout his journey. How? Because there was not a posted speed limit sign up there on that particular stretch of road, the cyclist went right through and over the rough terrain, going faster then he was supposed to without any warning. This lack of signage led directly to a loss of control on the dangerous path, showing how the environment itself dictated the perilous nature of his ride. The absence of critical information in the setting thus became a hazard in itself, impacting his speed and safety on the road.
1349	7330	3	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed—these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They vividly showed the treacherous path he took, the immense obstacles he had to surpass, and his ultimate will to prevail against them. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water is to show and directly impact how truly bad the conditions were for his journey. If the story had left out these specific details, the audience could say or think he was traveling through any old trail; for all they know, the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing through nice developed towns. So you see, the features in the setting help set the grim mood and also reveal the true conflict and severity of the story, grounding the narrative in a specific and challenging reality.
1350	7331	3	3	When you do something really often you get used to it, and well, I think the same thing applies to how sitting affects the cyclist's physical features. It might make their butt flat from the constant pressure on the saddle, or their back might develop a different posture and with a different shape. By a different shape I don’t mean that they are deformed, but every person is different so their back can either have a curved “C” shape from hunching over, or a straight “I” shape from good posture, or perhaps a “D” shape from developed muscles. This illustrates how the very act of cycling, a product of their environment and activity, can subtly alter their physical form over time through consistent habit and position.
1351	7332	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways, primarily through the oppressive heat and the desolate environment. The cyclist was very hot, as evidenced by the description that ""wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt"" and his growing fear ""that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" Furthermore, the towns that he passed through, which were supposed to have people, were in fact deserted, increasing his sense of isolation. This combination of extreme heat and profound solitude meant his ride ended up being even harder than it would have been, both physically and mentally. This is how the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist, compounding the difficulty of his journey."
1352	7333	3	3	"There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists, chiefly the challenging terrain and the extreme climate. The fact that ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM1) clearly shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and energy, especially for bike riders who must exert tremendous effort. Additionally, the ""high deserts of California in June"" (kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the intense heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to become overheated when exerting much force at once. These two conditions together create a formidable environment for any cyclist, testing their endurance and resolve."
1353	7334	3	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the road, creating a journey of intense emotional shifts. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut, experiencing a sense of freedom. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast, which tested his limits. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief after the strenuous effort. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large, but he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future, so he’s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push, showing his internal struggle. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future, ultimately shaping his character and perspective.
1354	7335	3	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings, which presented a series of relentless challenges. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist, exacerbating his physical strain. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water, a crucial resource in the desert climate. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed from dehydration and exhaustion. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving, driving the narrative forward. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through, creating a landscape of disorientation. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time, highlighting the precariousness of his journey. It was his confusion as to where the next town was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story of perseverance. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quotes, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization and underscored the immense scale of his solitary trek.
1355	7336	3	3	In 'Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist’s deteriorating condition. For example, the author wrote “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye.” The way the author described the hill as “crippling” shows how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist, emphasizing the physical toll of the landscape. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist’s journey was, “that smoky blues tune 'Summer time' rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat was making him, illustrating his mental and physical decline. I believe the author used these modifying details to support the description of the cyclist’s condition, painting a clearer picture of his struggle. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader’s perception of the cyclist’s journey, making the challenges he faced more tangible and visceral for the audience.
1356	7337	3	3	The terrain the cyclist faces don’t help very much considering he is almost out of water. He came across hills that tired him out a lot and made him even more thirsty, draining his already low energy reserves. Also, when he came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited by the prospect of refreshment, and that exertion made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didn’t have any energy left after all of that, he wouldn’t have been able to get to the bait shop, leaving him stranded without supplies in a difficult environment.
1357	7338	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of nowhere, a vast and unfamiliar landscape, and he doesn’t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn’t know the people who live there, which adds to his sense of isolation. The other thing is that he doesn’t have any food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can’t get energy, so he can’t ride the bike and is left immobile in a harsh and unforgiving place.
1358	7339	3	3	The features in the setting in the story affects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, “At same point, tumbleweed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumbleweeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affects the cyclist because he is already low on water then being in a place as hot as the desert made him get even more dehydrated from the relentless sun. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclist is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two clear examples of how the features in the setting of this story significantly affected the cyclist.
1359	7340	3	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water, a critical resource in the heat. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun, leading to severe physical distress. Another problem was the condition of the terrain, which was dry and uneven. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land, as it requires more effort and saps one's strength. These are just a few of the significant problems the cyclist encountered in this challenging environment.
1360	7341	3	3	The feature in the setting affected the cyclist a lot. It was a hot summer day and he was running out of water, a dangerous situation under the intense heat. With all the heat he could have had a heat stroke, which would have been a serious medical emergency. Another problem was the hills, which presented a formidable physical challenge. He didn't have a lot of energy, and the sun was steadily tiring him out and sapping his remaining strength, making his journey incredibly difficult.
1361	7342	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was hot and was a tough terrain. The oppressive heat of the environment directly influenced his physical state, making the journey more arduous. The difficult and uneven ground of the path posed a constant challenge to his progress, slowing him down and demanding greater effort. These combined environmental factors created a cycle of exhaustion that was hard to break. Ultimately, the setting's harsh characteristics significantly impacted the cyclist's experience.
1362	7343	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit. That shows that the ground is going to be rough and requires caution. The changing terrain forces him to adjust his speed and handling of the bicycle. This physical challenge is a direct consequence of the landscape through which he is traveling. Therefore, the environmental conditions directly dictate the nature of his ride.
1363	7344	3	3	The features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead” negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable. “When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.” Another feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” He worried about heatstroke and his body's need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed and was not traveled often by people “crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” These elements of the desert environment created a series of severe challenges. As you can see, the cyclist was negatively affected by the features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead.”
1364	7345	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead you're just going to have to be able to handle the ups and downs and the bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean. This fear was a direct result of the isolated and unforgiving nature of the landscape. The difficult path not only presented a physical obstacle but also a profound mental challenge. His anxiety about his fate was heightened by the desolate surroundings. Thus, the rough road impacted both his journey and his state of mind.
1365	7346	3	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to have a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. Each of these dangers was a direct product of the harsh setting through which he traveled. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushes through and survives the formidable challenges.
1366	7347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cool pines keep the sun from beating down on him and from getting heatstroke, offering a brief, shaded respite from the oppressive heat. Another way is that the towns he went to had either bad or no water and he was becoming dehydrated, his thirst growing with each passing mile. The heat from the sun was make him feel funny, he was hoping he wasn't seeing mirages as the road ahead shimmered with illusory water. Ultimately, the environment proved to be a formidable adversary on his journey.
1367	7348	3	3	The cyclist does not really like the setting of the road. It is messing up big time, presenting one challenge after another that saps his energy and morale. The relentless sun and the unforgiving terrain conspire against him, turning his ride into a grueling test of endurance. He finds little to appreciate in the harsh landscape that stretches out before him, a constant reminder of his difficult situation. This setting, therefore, significantly hinders his progress and dampens his spirits.
1368	7349	3	3	The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist to stop and get more water, a fact that fills him with growing anxiety. He says, “there is no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” As you can see that kind of setting would definitely affect the cyclist, leaving him isolated and vulnerable to the elements. The vast emptiness itself becomes a source of psychological strain, compounding his physical distress.
1369	7350	3	3	Some features of the setting that have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strength at first a tar like substance oozed out followed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid, making it utterly undrinkable. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change from flat road then turned into short hills, followed by a snake that looked like a diamond back, adding a new element of danger to his journey. These environmental challenges collectively shaped his difficult and perilous experience on the road.
1370	7351	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot; he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says, “Not many miles into the next section of the road, he noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Another example is, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.” These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist physically and mentally. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from an old person, especially if it is hot and you are riding a bike, as the journey can become far more arduous than anticipated.
1371	7352	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat to bumpy, which caused the cyclist to have a difficult trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the rough roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty. When he finally saw an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was abandoned. He began to pump water out of the water pump, and no matter how long he pumped for, the water that emerged looked like battery acid. The quote from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" These are the challenging features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey, ultimately leaving him dehydrated and desperate."
1372	7353	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, as stated, “...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The environment was intensely hot and the sun beat down on the cyclist, with the text noting “the sun was beginning to beat down...” The location was remote and there was no one to offer help or assistance, fitting the description of a ghost town. There were no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles, putting him at serious risk of dying from dehydration. His desperation is clear when “I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tar-like substance oozed out.” Furthermore, there was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bitten the cyclist. Additionally, there were hills that required more energy to climb. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills, he became more tired and thirsty, compounding his physical strain.
1373	7354	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old men's directions, he was furious with himself when they proved faulty. Seeing that the last attempt at following their direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delirious, the setting had added severely to the problem. The beating sun and high deserts of California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he came to a rusted water pump from which “black tar oozed out,” you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and, of course, terribly thirsty. The rough terrain and tumbleweeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old men's directions, filling him with regret and frustration over his predicament.
1374	7355	3	3	The cyclist in “Rough Road; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an early summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the changing terrain furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surroundings with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, then he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building which the cyclist describes as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” Upon seeing this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, resolving never to take road advice from other people again.
1375	7356	3	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and nothing was around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot, rapidly depleting his supply. It was dry everywhere around him so he couldn’t stop anywhere and cool off, with no shade or respite from the sun. Also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings, which offered no real aid and only deepened his sense of isolation. This hostile and barren environment is how the setting profoundly affected him, challenging his endurance at every turn.
1376	7357	3	3	The features mentioned in the story's setting made the journey significantly harder for the cyclist. The oppressive lack of water during a summer in California created a harsh environment, making it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the vast, arid deserts. His physical state deteriorated under the relentless sun, and his desperation grew with each passing mile. The worst part of this ordeal was when he tried to suck on pebbles to stimulate saliva in his parched mouth, a tactic that ultimately backfired when he accidentally ended up swallowing one, adding a new layer of discomfort to his already dire situation. This series of environmental challenges tested his endurance to its absolute limit.
1377	7358	3	3	The specific features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist because his body has a tremendously hard time adjusting to his life-threatening situation. The intense heat and the dry desert atmosphere are constantly draining his body of its essential water, yet he needs to keep pedaling on through the unforgiving landscape. His muscles ache and his throat burns with thirst, but stopping is not a viable option. Also, the terrain itself is completely stripped of any visible water sources, so he doesn't have anything natural to refuel with, leaving him in a state of perpetual dehydration. This combination of environmental factors creates a cycle of physical depletion that is difficult to overcome.
1378	7359	3	3	I think that if we were to enforce stricter punishments on those who speed, then there would be significantly less car crashes on our roads. This is a logical step toward improving public safety for all drivers and pedestrians. Furthermore, really those that have demonstrated bad road rage should be required to attend mandatory anger management courses. Such measures would address the root causes of aggressive driving, not just the symptoms, leading to a calmer and more secure driving environment for everyone involved. This comprehensive approach is necessary for meaningful change.
1379	7360	3	3	"There were many environmental features that negatively affected the cyclist during his arduous journey. One significant feature included the first ghost town that he came by, which was described as fitting ""the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This discovery had to affect him psychologically because he realized then that the people who told him about the shortcut hadn’t been out there for a long while, casting doubt on their advice. Another critical feature that affected the cyclist was the severe lack of water in a ""desert in California in June,"" a combination known for its extreme dryness. The cyclist now understood that it might be a very long while before he would get any more water to drink. The steep hills also had a major affect on the cyclist because he knew he was going to have to work exceptionally hard to reach the next town, all while consuming very little water. The abandoned Welch’s building also had a disheartening affect on him since it was empty and no drinks were left for him to find. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many formidable features on his difficult way to the National Park, each one presenting a unique and draining challenge."
1380	7361	3	3	"The cyclist sees his journey affected by a succession of events that will make his travel progressively more difficult and challenging. One of the first errors he makes is taking advice from people that have no real clue of where they are at, a mistake he later regrets, thinking, ""I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map."" The extreme temperature of the desert also heavily influenced him, as he was ""travelling through high desert of California,"" a place known for its scorching days. The cyclist also finds himself wrestling with a combination of conflicting emotions; at times he thinks he is going to pass away from exhaustion and thirst, and at other times he believes he will be fine and make it through. His spirits lift momentarily when he stumbles into a rather modern bathroom and drinks deeply from the sink, a moment of relief that gives him an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and continue his quest. This emotional rollercoaster is a direct result of the harsh and unpredictable conditions he faces."
1381	7362	3	3	"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the fork. He realized what he had stolen inside himself, that ""I reached myself right then that I'd always asked to ignore the proper path."" He would find on the last stretch is the bitter truth. This is said as he did not comprehend the sight and felt he was walking, not making progress, about to fall on the rough ground and get dust stuck to him. Did he truly want to happen again so he would be forced to always look at the map for guidance."
1382	7363	3	3	In the story, the man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obstacles in the story, which test his endurance and will. For example, he has gone about many miles without water, a significant distance under the harsh sun. Also, there are a lot of hills and turns within the story which slow him down, each ascent draining his energy further and each bend offering no relief. He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obstacles, culminating in a profound physical and mental challenge.
1383	7364	3	3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to a specific location. He has a new map and is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting there faster, a.k.a. a shortcut. He takes their directions and feels good about it, confident in his choice. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder, testing his resolve. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can’t exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse, each element compounding his distress. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up, his initial optimism shattered. But eventually he finds someone and doesn’t ask for directions, having learned his lesson. So the lesson is don’t take directions from a stranger unless you're willing to face the unexpected consequences that may follow.
1384	7365	3	3	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit”, which this means slow down or you will have an accident, forcing a cautious and arduous pace. Another feature was that it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it, leading to severe dehydration. I know this because it said “The water bottles contained water a few tantalizing sips” which means it was few left, highlighting his precarious situation. These environmental factors directly hindered his progress and well-being.
1385	7366	3	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he’s out in the desert, a time and place of extreme heat. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water, increasing his desperation. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” Another thing about his setting that changed was the hills, introducing grueling physical challenges. But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks him if he knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” By this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect, a hard-won realization. This is how the setting changed his perspective and approach to his journey.
1386	7367	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways it is affecting him is that the description of it makes it seem hotter than what it really is. He says “neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” which is a clear exaggeration meant to emphasize the intense heat he is experiencing. He is saying that it is really hot, and this perception influences his physical state and his morale. The features of the setting affected him because the oppressive atmosphere made it seem hotter, and he was taking the difficult conditions to an extreme, feeling overwhelmed by the environment. This demonstrates how the setting's characteristics can profoundly impact an individual's experience and perception.
1387	7368	3	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to describe the setting like “flat road” and “short, rolling hills,” which convey a sense of the journey's topography. There were also more examples of such descriptive language throughout the text. The way the cyclist described the setting gave the reader a clear visual picture of the landscape he was traveling through, making the environment feel tangible and real. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting because these physical features directly influenced the difficulty and nature of his ride, shaping his overall experience on the road. The connection between the cyclist and his surroundings is therefore a central element of the narrative.
1388	7369	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, that’s what the setting is like. When he got to the next town and left, he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong, and this positive mood was reflected in his surroundings. The setting was very tranquil and inviting during this part of his journey. The narrator says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (Kurmaskie), which vividly illustrates this harmony between his internal state and the external world. This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrator's mood, showing a direct correlation between his feelings and the environment’s description. Thus, the narrative effectively uses setting to mirror the protagonist's emotional journey.
1389	7370	3	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replaced by short, rolling hills, altering the rhythm of his ride. Then he came to a rough road, which presented a new physical challenge and discomfort. Another obstacle for the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out of the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of one hundred degrees, making it utterly undrinkable. Every time he pumped it, the water wouldn’t cool down and it tasted like battery acid, worsening his thirst. He was hitting his water bottle regularly to dislodge the air bubbles, which is why he needed new water so desperately. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to beat down, so he was becoming severely dehydrated. Furthermore, a snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like a diamondback, creating a sudden and dangerous interruption to his journey. These cumulative hardships from the setting significantly impeded his progress.
1390	7371	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The setting of the story is “a reservoir campground outside of Bakersfield, California” during the early summer. Being the early summer in southern California, the temperatures are going to be hot and arid. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is going to sweat a lot under these conditions. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water, depleting his supply quickly. The water runs out and we are now into our central conflict of his desperate thirst. The setting also leads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reservoir, fishing is going to be a popular activity for the local community. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have nearby, and since there is one at the reservoir, the cyclist could go inside and quench his thirst, finding a solution to his problem. Therefore, the setting of the story affects both the conflict and the solution, driving the narrative forward.
1391	7372	3	3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instinct was to use a perfectly good, up-to-date map he had brought along. Then he started having a conversation with some old men who decided to tell him about a shortcut they had taken back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the old men's shortcut through the desert with only one measly bottle of water. It was really hot outside, and the sun was scorching down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he had anticipated, and there was no shade or place for him to stop and get some more water. This made the trip much harder for him because now he was entirely focused on finding water and not on enjoying his ride. The setting of the course affected the cyclist in many ways; he was not prepared for the harsh route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he had taken the route that was on the map, then he would have known where he was, and his ride would not have been affected by desperate thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in his mouth to reserve saliva or by the constant, consuming thoughts of finding water. His journey serves as a clear lesson on the importance of proper preparation.
1392	7373	3	3	"The cyclist had a very rough time, as the elements were completely against him. It was exceptionally dry and hot, and he had no water left. In the text it says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This shows that he had hardly any water, and what little he did have would only make him thirstier. The quote, ""weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,"" makes it obvious that the setting was a harsh desert, and it allows you to visualize the isolated, barren landscape. There was no one in sight—not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water, but he was starting to go a little crazy from the ordeal. The hills were killer for him; in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This shows how rough the conditions were, especially since he told us in the beginning that he is an experienced cyclist. The biker had a very rough time, and the setting definitely was the cause of this immense struggle, ultimately defeating his spirits."
1393	7374	3	3	The weather can significantly change the course of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold outside, then the cyclist will bring heavier, warmer clothes to combat the chill. If it is hotter outside, he would most likely bring lighter clothes to stay cool and prevent overheating. Furthermore, if he was riding a farther distance, he would bring more supplies like water and food to sustain his energy for the long journey. Conversely, if he was going on a short ride, then he wouldn’t bring so much stuff, traveling light for convenience and speed. The way the weather is fundamentally changes the way a person will prepare, dictating their choices in gear and provisions to ensure their safety and comfort throughout the trip.
1394	7375	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the different aspects of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins his journey, he doesn’t even notice how hot it is, and he says, “the sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” His mood starts to change very quickly as the conditions worsen. Soon he drinks most of his water and becomes increasingly tired and weary from the heat. He finds a water pump which irritates him when he realizes the water tastes like “battery acid,” offering no relief. As he continues, he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamondback, so he slowly goes by it, his anxiety rising. When he notices a factory in the distance, he uses his last bit of energy to reach it, only to be deeply discouraged when he finds it completely abandoned and silent. His spirits finally rise when he eventually finds a small store and is able to drink a good amount of clean, refreshing water, which revitalizes him and highlights how his environment dictated his entire experience.
1395	7376	3	3	Multiple parts of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly. When he arrives in a town with a water pump, this part of the terrain initially offers hope, but the pump does not have good water; as noted, “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie). This disappointing discovery shows the setting's direct effect on his morale and physical state. His situation worsens when he becomes very dehydrated, described as “in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie), which impairs his judgment and physical capabilities. Another part of the setting that affected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory, a potential oasis, and found it closed, which deeply depressed him and crushed his last bit of hope for an easy respite. Each element of the landscape presented a new challenge, demonstrating the powerful role setting plays in shaping a journey's outcome.
1396	7377	3	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the harsh desert setting. He was riding under an intense, baking sun in a vast desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. The isolation was profound, and the road that he was driving on was not very smooth, being cracked and uneven, which gave him considerable troubles. The local wildlife also had a significant impact on him. He once went by a big, coiled snake that he cautiously had to ride around, giving it a wide berth. Furthermore, he thought he was going to die from exposure and that the circling birds were going to pick him off, a grim thought that weighed on his mind. The desert itself, with its oppressive heat and emptiness, was what really got to him. Deserts don’t have much water which is precisely what he desperately needed, and he couldn’t find a proper town to stop at, at least one with some people any way, only finding abandoned shacks. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge and debilitating effect on him, testing his physical and mental limits at every turn.
1397	7378	3	3	The cyclist was completely exhausted as he was laboriously going up a steep hill. The setting of the story affects the cyclist a lot, shaping his entire experience. This is because while in California it is often really good to be cycling, his particular journey was far from ideal. The weather was warm, which could be perfect, but the destination was not. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule that greeted him, a disappointing sight. Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a significant terrain changing. The flat road was abruptly replaced by short, taxing rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large, unexpected highway sign jumped out at him, startling him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit, requiring his full concentration to navigate safely and avoid an accident on the difficult path.
1398	7379	3	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist, imposing both physical and psychological challenges. These harsh settings discourage him profoundly, although he tries valiantly to keep hope alive. Seeing nothing but dry desert, watching the hills begin to heighten before him, and observing that nothing man-made is in sight for miles, all contribute to a sense of despair. These elements subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst, which becomes an overwhelming obsession. To one point the cyclist's original objective, perhaps a destination or a personal goal, became completely invalidated, overridden by his intense thirst pangs and total exhaustion. His journey thus became not about reaching a place, but merely about surviving the brutal conditions imposed by the landscape.
1399	7380	3	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds; it demands resilience and preparedness. Sure, riding a bike might be easy in a park, but being a true cyclist on a long journey is so much more difficult. Cyclists have many obstacles to over come while riding, which test their skill and endurance. One common obstacle would be a rough terrain, which can be punishing. Cyclists are often used to riding on smooth, paved roads, so going off-road or riding on a rugged dirt road might be a real challenge. In the short story “Do Exceed posted Speed Limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, there is another critical example for an obstacle cyclists have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, as illustrated by the quote, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is incredibly important when riding a bike to prevent a fall. In conclusion, when it comes to something perceived as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead on the open road.
1400	7381	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many profound ways, dictating his emotional state throughout the journey. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted at different points. The desert-like terrain, with its relentless sun, leaves him feeling very tired and desperately thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, sapping his strength, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls a pivotal moment: “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me”. The tumbleweeds are a stark symbol of dry desert death, rolling freely in the wind. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast, unforgiving stretch of sand and rocks. He realizes that were the snake in the path to poison him, he would lie under the beating sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, a flicker of hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive, a basic necessity that has become his entire world. In the end, the challenging setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him, proving his resilience against the elements.
1401	7382	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, ""not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this increased physical exertion. Another example is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This affected the cyclist because he had to wait cautiously for the snake to move so it didn't bite him while he crossed its path. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber."" This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now happy to have found water and to have finally reached his destination, which renewed his spirits. These environmental elements directly shaped his journey's challenges and his ultimate relief."
1402	7383	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several distinct ways because he saw “short, rolling hills,” “tumbleweeds” and “a ridiculously large snake,” and he thought that he was not getting anywhere. The hills forced him to exert more energy, slowing his progress and contributing to his fatigue. The sight of the desolate tumbleweeds and the dangerous snake blocking his path heightened his sense of isolation and the perilous nature of his journey. These combined elements fostered a growing feeling of frustration and the disheartening belief that his efforts were not yielding the forward movement he desired. Ultimately, the setting's physical and psychological challenges converged to create an overwhelming sense of stagnation.
1403	7384	3	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confident he can go on, spurred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on, providing a sense of vitality. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair, as the landscape offered no relief. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is proven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifies it by dashing his hopes for water. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the author's mood throughout the story, demonstrating a profound connection between environment and emotion.
1404	7385	3	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions during his journey. The rider followed their advice, but instead of taking the right way, he ended up taking a much longer and more arduous route. He was getting very thirsty and fatigued as a result of this detour. He also came face to face with a snake, which further heightened his anxiety and delayed his progress. After these successive setbacks, he finally found the nearest town and got the help he desperately needed, bringing his difficult ordeal to a close. This series of events shows how external interactions with people and wildlife can significantly alter a traveler's path and state of being.
1405	7386	3	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the hills that the cyclist has to go over and the intense heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat a lot, so he is losing fluids rapidly and he starts to get dehydrated, which weakens his body. The hills are making him have to work harder against the incline, using more energy and getting more tired with each ascent. Together, these environmental factors create a physically demanding situation that tests his endurance. The combination of the relentless heat and the challenging terrain proves to be a significant obstacle on his journey.
1406	7387	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, influencing his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay, the cyclist is very confident, which is shown when he says, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite have my name written all over them."" This statement reveals his confidence because he is certain he can complete the journey to Yosemite. However, when he runs out of water due to the intense heat, he begins to lose confidence and even fears he might die. You know he is running out of water when he observes, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his physical energy also dropped significantly. Yet, after the loss of water and confidence, he actually developed a higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This shift is a part of human nature, as our bodies can switch into survival mode and become fiercely determined to survive. As you can see, the cyclist was affected in many profound ways by the challenging features of the setting he traveled through."
1407	7388	3	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him directly throughout his difficult journey. One example is the old men that give him advice at the start. They tell him that they know a great shortcut, which ultimately turns into the author's hardest ride ever, leading him through a harsh and unforgiving landscape. Another example is the combination of the extreme heat, the remote desert location, the time of day, and the time of the year. Being in California, in the desert during the summer will subject you to lots of oppressive heat. In order to beat this heat, you need lots of water, which becomes one of his biggest problems as he eventually runs out. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned Welch's grape juice building, where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice, which torments him with thoughts of cool relief. All these elements combined gave the author a tremendously hard time, but in the end, his perseverance paid off when he found a bait and tackle shop where he was finally saved and could replenish his supplies.
1408	7389	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is profoundly affected by the features of the setting. In the story, it says, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This quote means that it was getting hotter, and this increasing heat was going to make it significantly harder for the cyclist to continue his ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affect the cyclist is, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that the cyclist is now not only going to have to deal with the relentless heat, but he is also going to have to ride over hill after hill, which demands more effort. Even though they may be small, rolling hills, it still takes a lot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly over a long distance. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar-like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water that he uses his small amount of remaining strength to try and get some, only to find the water is undrinkable and scalding hot. In conclusion, these have been clear examples of how the cyclist was physically and mentally challenged by the demanding features of the setting.
1409	7390	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist significantly because of the sharp turns and the profound loneliness he experienced. The text provides evidence for this when it says, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town.” This statement highlights the immense isolation he felt, as it took him forty long miles of cycling through a desolate landscape before encountering any sign of human settlement. The sharp turns on the road would have demanded constant attention and physical effort, slowing his progress and increasing his fatigue. The loneliness of the journey, with only the empty road for company, likely weighed on his morale, making the arduous trip feel even longer and more difficult. Therefore, the challenging geography and the isolating nature of the route were key features of the setting that impacted his experience.
1410	7391	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because the journey involved tough terrain and extreme heat that had a severe impact on him. It seemed that everywhere he would go, he couldn’t find anything—no buildings or people—until he finally reached that one town. In the story, “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist quotes, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” Being stranded on your bike in the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing harsher conditions ahead, can only give you a sense of hopelessness. He soon almost ran out of water, which only made things worse, amplifying his physical distress and mental anxiety. The sun beating down on him relentlessly and his mind beginning to play tricks on him added to his ordeal. So for the cyclist, the harsh and lonely settings had a lot to do with the tremendous difficulty of his journey from start to finish.
1411	7392	3	3	The features the cyclist experienced during his ride profoundly affected his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat ground, drinking plenty of water and riding without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became dependent on his water supply, which was now running low. This troubled him, but he was initially optimistic, telling himself “the next town was only eighteen miles.” After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills, and this new terrain started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set in, and every hill presented a fresh challenge, draining his energy further. Once completely out of water he sucked on pebbles, a desperate act where he hoped it would “take your mind off of thirst.” When he finally made it to the next town, he was so profoundly relieved. Everything from the physical toll of dehydration to the mental strain of losing hope affected the cyclist on his arduous ride, marking the journey as a test of both physical and mental endurance.
1412	7393	3	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist, creating a perilous environment. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry, sucking the moisture from the air and his body. The roads also had a lot of hills, and when a cyclist has to use his dwindling energy in the oppressive heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard and demoralizing. There were also no stops to refill his water along the way, which is critically bad because the intense heat, the lack of water, and all of his energy expenditure leads to major dehydration and exhaustion. The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous, posing a significant threat to anyone attempting the journey.
1413	7394	3	3	"The setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist greatly, imposing severe physical demands. He was riding through a desert in June, a time known for its brutal weather. This meant that the temperature was very high, creating a constant risk. The narrator even states “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June,” highlighting the deceptive danger. Another feature of the setting that affected him were the relentless hills, which he even calls ""evil"" in his mind. These geographical features combined with the climate to create a formidable challenge that tested his limits throughout the ride."
1414	7395	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he knows he’s in the wrong area, a realization that dawns on him with growing dread. The cyclist understands that he should have never took that advice from the old men, a mistake that now weighs heavily on him. So he was upset and knew he should have taken his own initial advise instead of listening to others. The cyclist had a sinking feeling that he wasn’t supposed to take this route; he said he shouldn’t have let them take a peek at his map, a simple act that led him astray. So the features really affect him, fueling his regret and frustration over the misguided direction his journey has taken.
1415	7396	3	3	In ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble, testing his resolve from the start. First, people give him the wrong directions, leading him into difficulty. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of miles on a bike through extreme temperatures, which saps his strength. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard under the scorching sun becomes a grueling ordeal. He doesn’t even have any cool water to drink, a basic necessity. As the character says, “…followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (Kurmaskie). That kind of water didn’t help him either, as it was almost undrinkable. It didn’t quench his thirst because it was so hot; he said it tasted like battery acid, providing no relief. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedaling till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool, refreshing water. Then he headed off to Yosemite with a newfound determination and didn’t take anyone’s advice, having learned a hard lesson about self-reliance on the road.
1416	7397	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California, making it VERY hot outside and creating a harsh, arid environment. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes hiding in the brush. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest, choked with vegetation. ì@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.î This made it harder for the cyclist to navigate and reach his destination, constantly forcing him to slow his pace and remain vigilant.
1417	7398	3	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns, completely devoid of life. In the text, the author said, ìit fit the traditional definition of a ghost town,î describing empty buildings and silent streets. It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldnít refill his water at any functioning establishment. This lack of resources in the abandoned settlements posed a serious threat to his journey through the unforgiving landscape.
1418	7399	3	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done despite the immense difficulties. When they said only ìeighteen miles down the road,î he thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he ìconserved his waterî carefully and last kept on going, pushing through his exhaustion. When the road turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply, demanding even greater physical and mental endurance to persevere until the end.
1419	7400	3	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation and foresight. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills that stretched for miles under a relentless sun. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through, highlighting how the severe environment could quickly overwhelm even a determined individual without proper planning.
1420	7401	3	3	Setting in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî really determines how the story turns out, shaping every challenge the protagonist faces. The setting was in deserted areas, the vast desert, and even roadways cutting through the emptiness. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated and desperate; without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing ì a water-depleting @NUM1î under the scorching heat. When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like ìbattery acid,î offering false hope. Setting can affect alot in the story, proving to be a central character that dictates survival. Without this specific setting, the story would be alot different than it is now, lacking its tense and perilous atmosphere.
1421	7402	3	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist encountered a couple of significant problems that turned his journey into a struggle. He had only a little amount of water, and the roads were exceptionally tough. Furthermore, the complete absence of cars on the road meant there was no possibility of assistance. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist, leading to a moment of deep despair. As noted on page @NUM1 paragraph one in the first sentence, ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me down.î The natural elements were so relentlessly tough on the cyclist that he was on the verge of giving up all hope. But luckily, in the end, the cyclist found a place to stop where he could finally get water and receive directions, providing a crucial reprieve from his ordeal.
1422	7403	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist. He is desperately trying to get water, but when he tried the pump, the result was utterly disappointing, as ìa tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î The cyclist doesnít have any potable water, so it is immensely difficult for him to go on. Under the intense heat, he could easily suffer from heat exhaustion. His hopes were momentarily raised as he came to the next town, but he only found that ìthe building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welchís Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant,î which was a cruel irony. He is therefore forced to continue, still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the harsh and unforgiving features of the setting affect the cyclist throughout his journey.
1423	7404	3	3	In the story there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was extremely dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was so dry and hot made his ride physically hard and mentally draining. For example, the oppressive heat caused him to get severely dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel the early signs of heatstroke. The difficult terrain caused an even bigger dilemma, directly impacting his progress. For instance, in the story him riding through that rugged terrain causes him to get excessively tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is, compounding his physical struggles. These environmental challenges worked in tandem to test his limits.
1424	7405	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the profound emptiness, the overwhelming feeling that he is all alone. There is not a car, person, or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen, like a mechanical failure or an injury, then there would be no way of telling anyone for help is daunting. He realizes that it would be a long while before anyone would be able to find him. This isolation might ease some, but I think it drove him even more. It gave him that extra, desperate boost of energy that seems to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of environment. The desert is very unforgiving. The sun beats down as if you are the only person on the planet. The lack of water, the fact that it hasnít rained in decades, is ever-present. The never ending, @CAPS1 road stretches ahead. The ups and downs of the route and all the animals that await him pose constant threats. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it is a real fear. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text have a lot to do with the cyclist and affect him a great deal, shaping his entire experience.
1425	7406	3	3	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by pushing him to the brink of severe dehydration and exhaustion. The harsh environment makes his journey a fight for survival. Also in the setting he found the abandon factory, a symbol of desolation which makes him feel hopeless and underscores his isolation. If the setting was elsewhere, perhaps a more populated or supportive area, then he would have felt different and faced fewer hardships. For instance, as he didnít meet the people of the reserve he could have been on better, maintained roads rather than the old, deteriorating roads he was forced to travel. The specific conditions of the setting are therefore central to the challenges he must overcome.
1426	7407	3	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I’m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing, as that road was replaced by a host of rolling hills. With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author’s “Short, rolling hills”, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. The relentless nature of this terrain, offering no real respite, ensures that the cyclist's struggle is continuous. I’m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills, a feeling of profound exhaustion that seeped deep into his bones from the unyielding landscape.
1427	7408	3	3	"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly. First he starts off happy because he’s going to Yosemite national park and he’d gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs,"" feeling optimistic about the journey ahead. Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town, which was a disheartening sight. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch’s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. Next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old man’s there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it, learning a valuable lesson about trusting outdated information."
1428	7409	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn’t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This statement proves that the cyclist wasn’t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren’t there, but you want to see those things. “ I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” It was a good decision that the cyclist didn’t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there, demonstrating the mental toll of his physical state. Overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful and always prepare for the harsh realities of the environment.
1429	7410	3	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me."" These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist. Each obstacle, from the exhausting hills to the frightening wildlife, compounded the physical challenge, ultimately overwhelming his ability to continue effectively on his journey."
1430	7411	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information @MONTH1 not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong. The setting, with its misleading paths and outdated landmarks, taught him that personal experience and reliable tools are more valuable than secondhand advice from another time. He realized that the landscape itself holds the true directions, and trusting it directly is the only way to navigate successfully through a changing world.
1431	7412	3	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there, with empty streets and silent buildings amplifying his isolation. The next town wasnít any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road, a discouraging distance in the oppressive heat. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey, each one testing his resolve. Some of these problems included snakes slithering across the path - The fact that he wos running out of water, causing him to ration every drop- the hill, which seemed to grow steeper with every pedal stroke-and the condition of the road, which was cracked and uneven, making the ride treacherous. Despite these mounting difficulties, he had no choice but to press forward into the vast, empty landscape.
1432	7413	3	3	The features of the setting in ìDO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMITî affect the cyclist in a negative way, creating a series of escalating challenges. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling, introducing steep inclines that sap his energy. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle with navigation and morale. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed blowing across his path, snakes basking on the hot asphalt and a critical lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful ordeal. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park, a fear that haunts every mile. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp, a welcome sight of civilization. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on, his spirit renewed for the journey ahead.
1433	7414	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water, a combination that is both physically and mentally draining. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired, his muscles burning with the effort under the relentless sun. The dude is probably dehydrated and his conditions are getting worse with each passing hour, his throat parched and his focus beginning to waver. The harsh environment was clearly taking a significant toll on his ability to continue his arduous journey.
1434	7415	3	3	The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, presenting a formidable challenge to his preparedness. Cyclist are in very good physical shape, trained for endurance. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist, and this is precisely what happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey, initially thinking, ìI would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist profoundly. ìTumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeÖ.î posed direct physical dangers. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sipsî, highlighting the critical shortage of his most vital resource. The cyclist was tired and exhausted, his energy depleted. The weather and terrain had worn him down, proving that even the strongest resolve can be tested by external conditions. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes, as I have experienced myself. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I canít play as long, my performance suffering. The features of a setting can clearly affect people, as demonstrated by the cyclist's arduous experience.
1435	7416	3	3	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him, forming the central conflict of his journey. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme, blistering heat of the desert during his ride, a formidable opponent in itself. He also says ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips.î This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with a critical and frightening lack of water, compounding the danger. These facts and quotes show the clear and present threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride, where the very environment he traveled through became his greatest adversary.
1436	7417	3	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way, primarily through the harsh desert environment. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated, and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble, as his supply is critically low. Because of the lack of water, not only might he die, but he begins to see mirages, which disorients him further. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration, and he becomes uneasy about things, his physical state deteriorating. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store, showing his weakened condition. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little, which compounds his problems. Panicing isnít good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated, as panic canít help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lots of water, which he runs low on, creating a desperate situation. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die from heat exposure. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape, which makes travel arduous. For example, theyíre landscape is mostly all hot sand, difficult to traverse on a bicycle. Therefore, the setting does profoundly affect the cyclist, creating a multifaceted challenge for his survival.
1437	7418	3	3	The setting, which is a desert in the summer, significantly affects the cyclist in several ways. For example, she caldnít go as fast, as stated, ìThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,î so that affected his ability to find water and cover ground efficiently. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going, with the heat intensifying his thirst. For example, ìI pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldnít cool down,î showing how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly, with the warm water offering little relief. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind, playing tricks on him. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump on the rough terrain. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function, impairing both his physical stamina and his mental clarity in the challenging environment.
1438	7419	3	3	"In the story ìRough Road Aheadî the features of the setting affect the cyclist both positively and negatively. At points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful, showing a range of emotional impacts. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight, which created a sense of hopelessness. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes, a disappointing discovery. When he pumped the water, no water come out, deepening his despair. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect, as evidenced when the cyclist gave ""teaches life can be so cruel."" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel, showing his negative state of mind. At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader, providing relief. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop, a potential source of help. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said ìmy troubles thirst and feels he all behind me,î indicating a shift in his outlook. Thus, different settings in the story gave the author a different affect, illustrating the powerful influence of environment."
1439	7420	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist significantly because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride and how much energy you expend. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,î the physical challenge increased. The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water, as the effort required more hydration. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time, a constant and draining presence. Sometimes he didnít seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, ìThe sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.î He didnít know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride, depleting his reserves prematurely. Consequently, the environmental factors worked together to hinder his progress.
1440	7421	3	3	"The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert, an environment that posed immediate physical challenges. This made him thirsties and less active, sapping his strength and slowing his pace. The story provides clear evidence of this, saying, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,"" illustrating his severe lack of water and the intense physical exertion caused by the heat. This desperate situation created by the setting directly impacted his ability to continue his journey effectively."
1441	7422	3	3	My point of view is that several factors affect a cyclist, including the need for people to recycle more often. Sometimes people are seen throwing away a trash can with a soda bottle still inside of it. Cyclists nowadays sometimes need to advocate for changing that behavior. My conclusion is that people need to save and recycle stuff to make some new things, which helps to create a good quality world for cyclists and their environment.
1442	7423	3	3	The cyclist decided to listen to the geologists' advice about the route. After a while, he starts to get tired from the arduous journey. After the scenery changes to a harsh desert, he starts to get mad at his situation. He criticizes himself bitterly for accepting advice from those old-timers who haven't left the town in years and whose knowledge was clearly outdated.
1443	7424	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout his journey. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination no matter what. The first problem was when he came to the fork of sorts, as he put it, and found his path unclear. He needed more water desperately, but the pumps he found were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tar-like substance followed by blackish water. He tested a small amount, hoping it was better than it looked, but it was not. It tasted terribly like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occurred was, while he was becoming dehydrated more and more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road blocking his path. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard in his weakened state; he was successful and continued down the road. The third obstacle he ran into was when he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his great disappointment, he found only an old abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. As nerve-racking and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice, refreshing drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still had a smile on his face at the end of his ordeal.
1444	7425	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist primarily because of his endurance levels. The challenges directly test the amount of time he can ride without stopping for a rest. They test however long he can ride up a steep hill without giving up, and however many bumps he rides over without losing control. Furthermore, the setting challenges however long he can ride without a drink of water under the scorching sun, pushing his physical limits to the extreme.
1445	7426	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes that occur while riding his bike through the landscape. The cyclist began his journey well with a smile on his face, but then his mood changed because the condition of the road deteriorated and the weather became unbearably hot. Also, there was not any signal or signpost to show him where he was going and to confirm it was the correct way he was taking. Furthermore, his bike tire went flat and needed to be replaced, adding another delay to his difficult trip. Despite all these setbacks, he persevered and continued on his path.
1446	7427	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by forcing him to contend with the roads and the heat. He was traveling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, and he noted that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder. The cyclist had to put more effort into it because the roads were long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He then ran into a snake which told him that he was getting deeper into the desert, a sign of the increasing dangers and isolation of his journey. This encounter underscored the challenging nature of the environment he was pushing through. Ultimately, the physical demands of the landscape tested his resolve at every turn.
1447	7428	3	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the turmoil in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills, the Welch factory, and finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a haven, a safe ground that contains everything the man needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready and eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is where the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as “the high deserts of California.” The sun is boiling down and water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder and the chances of his survival lessen. When he crosses a snake, it suggests even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive and is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist by mirroring his internal state throughout the entire arduous trip.
1448	7429	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilemma. “Weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the pavement in front of me.” He had to stop and wait by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that “really did look like a diamondback.” Later, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it’s a Welch’s Grape Juice factory. He thought that it might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” Finally, he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he finally got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of the landscape thus presented a series of obstacles that culminated in a hard-won lesson.
1449	7430	3	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far, yet the vast emptiness also presented a psychological challenge. There was nothing in sight—no cars, building or structure of any kind—which made the distance seem endless and his goal feel perpetually out of reach. This stark, featureless terrain tested his optimism, forcing him to rely solely on his own determination to continue. The absence of any landmarks made the journey feel longer and more solitary. In the end, the very emptiness that offered hope also became his greatest trial.
1450	7431	3	3	The author was affected in many ways by the conclusion of his journey. He was tired from the blazing heat, didn’t have much water, and got lost. Water simply was limiting and as he went farther and farther it seemed like things would get worse and worse for him. A man had given him the wrong directions and he probably hadn’t been off his porch in decades, the author said. This misguidance led him into a dire situation, amplifying his physical exhaustion with the frustration of being lost. The entire experience served as a harsh lesson about the reliability of advice and the brutal reality of the desert. He ultimately learned to be more self-reliant after such a taxing ordeal.
1451	7432	3	3	"In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example, ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit."" Also, the dry, cracked pavement gave way to loose gravel and potholes, making the ride jarring and unstable. The cyclist had to slow down considerably, gripping the handlebars tightly to maintain control on the deteriorating surface. This transition highlighted the importance of heeding warnings and adapting to changing conditions. The journey served as a clear reminder that the path is not always smooth and requires constant vigilance."
1452	7433	3	3	"In the story, there are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey. The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it tasted horrible, like metal and rust. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it, which sapped his energy and slowed his progress. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be abandoned, with broken windows and no signs of life, deepening his sense of isolation. Eventually he finds a town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn’t know, realizing the value of self-reliance."
1453	7434	3	3	Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor of what little he could find made his thirst unbearable. The relentless sun and the barren landscape offered no shade or respite, draining his strength with every turn of the pedals. These affected the cyclist in a major way, testing his physical limits and mental resolve in the harsh, unforgiving environment. The desert proved to be a formidable adversary on his path.
1454	7435	3	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficult he become more ignorant and hopeless. 'Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh' (@NUM1). He wasn't going to die, but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it, amplifying his own misery. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. 'Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot road, and he started taking stabs at the old men, 'I made a mental note to change that paragraph' (@NUM4). The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back on a trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless, angry, and he felt sorry for himself, a lesson learned through unnecessary hardship.
1455	7436	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June, where the heat is intense and oppressive. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn’t drink, leaving him parched. Also, the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly, depleting his precious supply much faster than anticipated. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart, stretching the distance between hope and reality. These environmental and social factors combined to create a challenging and disheartening experience for the traveler.
1456	7437	3	3	"There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey, and this particular cyclist seemed to have bad luck from the start. He begins by mentioning his plan for a trip to Yosemite, and the men who hear this offer him a tip about the route. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions without question, but he ends up getting lost as a result. Compounding his troubles, the cyclist is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. That means he is riding in the summer with extremely dry air and intense heat. When he finally reaches the first so-called ""town"" he sees, he cannot get the water he desperately needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, an encounter that startles him and slows his progress. Because it is so hot and he is so tired, he begins to see shimmering mirages on the horizon that further disorient and affect him. All of these environmental features combine to force the cyclist into one long, tiring journey through the unforgiving desert. Ultimately, these features also taught him the valuable lesson to not take advice from old men who have not left their porch, because their information may be dangerously out of date."
1457	7438	3	3	The setting for this event involved a little boy who was riding his bike when he met an old man. The man told him about a shortcut that would save him time on his journey. So, trusting the old man, the boy took this unfamiliar road, and I guess something went wrong along the way. The path was not what he expected, leading him into difficulties he had not anticipated and turning what was meant to be a quicker route into a problematic detour.
1458	7439	3	3	In the piece “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting profoundly affect the main character, the cyclist. After he first journeyed from the house where he met the old men, he rode over vast stretches of flat desert terrain, where the relentless sun beat down and dehydrated him rapidly. Soon, though, the terrain changed dramatically. As Kurmaskie writes, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This new topography tests his endurance even more, as he now has to carefully maneuver his bike down the hills while already being severely dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion, pushing his limits further.
1459	7440	3	3	Hot, dry, and isolated—all are the key features of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist. First, there are the intensely hot days with not a lot of water available to drink, which causes him to become dangerously dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost or encounters trouble. As Joe Kurmaskie explains, “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This profound isolation amplifies his vulnerability. Finally, a creature, a large snake, came along the road directly in his path, presenting a physical obstacle so he had to carefully move around it, adding another layer of difficulty to his arduous journey.
1460	7441	3	3	Setting is one of the most important needs for a cyclist; if the terrain or weather are bad, the journey becomes far more difficult. For a cyclist, the hotter it is, the more demanding the ride becomes, as the extreme heat saps energy and increases the risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion, fundamentally shaping the entire experience.
1461	7442	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist faces a challenging problem. For example, I noticed the terrain changing. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, which made the ride more strenuous. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway appeared. That shows when he arrived, the road was not good and also the large highway had a high jump that was difficult to navigate. The cyclist's journey was directly impacted by these difficult physical features of the landscape, making his progress slow and arduous.
1462	7443	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by it being so hot outside that he could have passed out and died from heat exhaustion. The intense sun beat down on him relentlessly. Also, he saw a snake that scared him to death, but he managed to pass the snake without incident. Furthermore, he saw a building that could probably help him, but it was abandoned; it was a Welch factory, offering no refuge. Then as he ran further down, he saw a fish place and went to the bathroom to get some water to cool down. Then somebody asked him where he was going and they tried to talk to him, but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people, trusting his own resources over potentially misleading advice.
1463	7444	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist takes some out-of-date information from a couple of old guys. As he went along following their directions, he found out that their directions were out-of-date and at points dangerous. Also, the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot; it didn't help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example, in the story when he enters the fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didn’t help him because he didn’t have a lot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himself that he would get out; the rusty pumps meant he couldn’t get any good water. Also in the story it says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” and that setting affected him because at this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted and almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasn't a building, or a car, or anything, so it was pretty much an empty desert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn’t get sent out of the desert alive. In conclusion, in the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting didn’t help the cyclist in his hope or confidence of getting out because the setting was very abandoned and also it was very hot and it didn’t help that he was in a desert.
1464	7445	3	3	"Well, since the cyclist is in a desert and out of water, he is probably not going to be happy or confident. The ""ghost towns"" he passes through aren't really a boost of confidence either, as they are empty and desolate. The rugged hills made him angry too, as they required more effort to climb. Ultimately, the oppressive heat affected him the most, draining his energy and spirit as he struggled through the barren landscape."
1465	7447	3	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandoned, so he could not get any food or water from them, which was a great disappointment. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills, and this change will put more strain on his legs, making him tire more quickly. Finally, the land was hot and dry, which was making him dehydrated and sapping his strength as he pedaled onward. This is how the various features of the land negatively affected the cyclist during his difficult journey.
1466	7448	3	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about, leading him further astray. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid, leaving him more parched than before. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition, full of potholes and cracks, and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die from the exhaustion and despair. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink, a small but crucial relief that allowed him to continue his arduous journey.
1467	7449	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he ìenjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.î The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the ìcollection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in officeì and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilberís Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets, a moment of pure, life-saving relief. @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he ìpromised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future, learning a valuable lesson about preparation and trusting reliable sources over casual, misguided advice.
1468	7450	3	3	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water, leading to dizziness and fatigue. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water desperately. ìI hung my head,î means that he was depressed and defeated by his circumstances. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances, especially in a harsh and unforgiving environment. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking @CAPS1, a profound experience that highlighted his vulnerability.
1469	7451	3	3	I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also, pushing the cyclist to his physical and mental limits. The relentless sun and the desolate landscape tested his resolve constantly. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged, as overcoming such difficulties can build character and resilience. The entire ordeal served as a powerful reminder that perseverance in the face of adversity often leads to personal growth and a greater appreciation for one's own strength and capabilities.
1470	7452	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring like to drink more water to avoid dehydration. When no one else was around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if thereís a chance that he is on the wrong path, and no body available to tell him otherwise, amplifying his sense of isolation. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining as his energy reserves dwindled. If the setting were different, this story would not have been as traumatic, as a more hospitable environment would have provided the resources and reassurance needed for a far less harrowing experience.
1471	7453	3	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECT THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE “SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,” AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTINESS REDUCED HIM TO USING HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER, WHICH WAS DWINDLING RAPIDLY. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO AFFECT HIM IN A COUPLE OF WAYS, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT HEAT AND BY INDUCING DEHYDRATION. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN “GHOST TOWNS” THAT CONSISTED OF “RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS” AND “SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.” THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIDN’T HAVE ANY WATER FOR HIM TO FILL UP WITH AS HE BECAME INCREASINGLY DEHYDRATED. OBSTACLES SUCH AS “TUMBLEWEEDS” AND “PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES” ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLIST AS HE MOVED ON THE @NUM1 ROAD ONLY DOING “12 MPH,” FORCING HIM TO SWERVE OR SLOW DOWN. ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON. THE OBSTACLE BEING A “LONG CROPPING HILL,” THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USED MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMIT THE HILL, LEAVING HIM COMPLETELY SPENT AND STRUGGLING TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY.
1472	7454	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist, and the major problems that a cyclist encounters are some rough road, the constant inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, and the need to not exceed the posted speed limit. For a cyclist to be doing all this, I don't think there is going to be any features of the setting that would not affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to be maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 on a challenging route or dealing with a water-depleting @NUM2, sometimes life can feel so cruel and demanding. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much speed, but for them to be using the necessary equipment, they won’t get seriously injured, which highlights the importance of preparation. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be “Never accept a journey without being fully aware of the setting's features and their potential impact.”
1473	7455	3	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and extreme isolation, describing how “flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” After reading this information and the vivid descriptions, I inferred that the author was alone in the desert facing awful conditions. I also inferred a tone of resentment and frustration in his account. He seemed to wish he hadn’t taken the “shortcut” that landed him in this harsh desert environment. The hot weather was another significant factor that affected the author, as he described trying to keep his balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to properly conserve his water supply. Ultimately, the combination of rough terrain, utter desolation, and scorching temperatures seemed to have profoundly affected the cyclist and author, teaching a harsh lesson about preparation.
1474	7456	3	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch’s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water; he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, “with all my strength.” Yet @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, a very risky thing to do while cycling, because the water “had the flavor of battery acid,” making it completely undrinkable. Next, the Welch’s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of “a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice” made him feel even worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, a reminder of refreshments in the past when there was nothing left for him in the present. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life, as he arrived and ""drank deeply from the sink."" He was so happy and relieved that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp, showing how a single positive feature could completely reverse his desperate circumstances and allow him to continue."
1475	7457	3	3	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story. I was not sure about the details, but the name of the story sounded pretty good. If I was in the story, I would not be good because the story is really crazy and challenging. I would need to be really good to even start and write about such an intense experience, and it would require a lot of effort to understand all the events that took place within the narrative.
1476	7458	3	3	In the setting they are in Lodi, California, a location that is part of the vast desert. The desert environment effects the cyclist real bad, presenting a series of harsh challenges. For one, it is really hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly. Two, the intense heat is making him increasingly thirsty, and he is rapidly running out of his limited water supply. Then last, he is near no towns, isolated in the arid landscape, so he can’t get anymore water. The profound isolation and extreme heat combine to create a desperate situation, so the setting does effect the cyclist profoundly, threatening his entire journey.
1477	7459	3	3	The cyclist is most affected by the oppressive heat, which drains his strength and resolve. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite, pushing through the grueling conditions. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently, leading to a state of exhaustion. At one point, he has to make sure the building he sees is a mirage and not a real source of help. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him, creating illusions that highlight his deteriorating physical and mental state in the unforgiving environment.
1478	7460	3	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid, creating a severe test of his endurance. As he continued on his ride he got hotter and hotter, the heat intensifying with every mile. He was hoping to find water after he finished off his last bit, a desperate wish that grew more urgent as his supply vanished. Taking advice from an old man was his last decision he made, a final attempt to find a solution to his dire predicament. This choice represented his last hope for survival in the face of the overwhelming and hostile desert setting.
1479	7461	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day” This is an example of how he lost courage, as the beauty of the day contrasted sharply with his internal fear. I wanted to be brave and be strong, pushing forward with determination. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak, sapping his physical and mental fortitude. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear” This is an example of how the author lost some optimism, envisioning a grim end. He didn’t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to, he should have thought to himself that he was going to make it, but the setting was just too rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic, his spirit worn down by the relentless environment.
1480	7462	3	3	The features of his journey are cruel, each one adding to his hardship. The “rolling hills” make him work harder to get over them, demanding extra physical exertion. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so, creating a dangerous cycle of dehydration. The lack of water he has does not help, making his struggle even more precarious. Poisonous snakes don’t really bother him if he leaves them alone, but they are a constant reminder of the dangers present. The condition of the roads adds on to the challenge of the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills, jolting his body and draining his energy. So this guy is getting it pretty rough from every aspect of the punishing landscape.
1481	7463	3	3	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. It says in the reading “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” and this constant change in elevation would wear a person out without a good supply of water. Furthermore, the disorienting nature of the landscape made it difficult for him to be sure in what direction he was travelling. And another thing that affects him is the hot June weather in California, which intensifies the physical strain of his journey and contributes significantly to his exhaustion and dehydration.
1482	7464	3	3	Throughout “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry, and dangerous. There was no water to be found and the terrain was rough and bumpy, making for a jarring and difficult ride. The speaker stated, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist faced land blockings and dangerous animals, which caused him to slow down a little bit and proceed with greater caution. It was extremely hot out in the setting he was in, as the cyclist was in the deserts of California in June. The speaker stated, “@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was experiencing the high temperatures of the setting, which posed a direct threat to his health. Ultimately, the cyclist witnessed the intense and hazardous features of the setting, which shaped his entire experience.
1483	7465	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways, primarily through physical hardship and mental strain. He becomes delusional when he said that if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat, a stark indication of his deteriorating mental state. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water and is having to push hard to make it to the next town, a situation exacerbated by the unforgiving environment. These combined factors demonstrate how the setting directly impacts his physical endurance and psychological well-being.
1484	7466	3	3	The features of the setting started out easy like a road that's flat, with cool pines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it got harder with a lack of water, the road is not flat anymore but instead filled with challenging inclines, and there are snakes to watch out for while the cool pines are gone, leaving him exposed to the harsh sun. This progression from a manageable to a difficult environment clearly shows how the changing setting increased the physical demands and dangers of his journey.
1485	7467	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month. There is not much water present in a desert, and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or creek for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the effect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cow skull, as in movies. Deserts are intimidating; they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water, thoughts of death and how he was ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" ran through his now-terrified head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified, for there are people in those places and places to be safe. But, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading, as it shapes both the physical challenges and the psychological turmoil of the characters."
1486	7468	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert-like environment and there was no one around for most of it, so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected in the story when he says, ""I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" That affected him because he had been drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and was almost out, so he desperately needed to fill up with more, but he did not have a reliable place to get it. This encounter with the broken pump underscores the harsh reality of his situation. That is one of the key features of the setting that profoundly affected him, leaving him vulnerable and desperate in the unforgiving landscape."
1487	7469	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while, he had drunk almost all of his water, but he still had a considerable distance to go before he reached his destination. He was going to try to find somewhere to stop so he could pick up more water, but there was nothing around for miles, no stores or houses in sight. He also got increasingly tired because he was out in the relentless sun, had barely any water left to drink, and he didn’t know where he was going, which added to his mental fatigue. One last example was that he was completely lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people anywhere in the desolate surroundings. So if he were to get hurt or sick, no one would have been able to help him, highlighting his isolation. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired, and getting lost were the features of the setting that significantly affected the cyclist during his difficult journey.
1488	7470	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water while trying to traverse the difficult terrain. In the setting, there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, as noted when he states, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California."" The word ""high"" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more strenuous and demanding. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said, ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" When the speaker says ""replaced,"" he is trying to show a distinct and challenging change of terrain. Another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses on other hills, described as ""tumbleweeds crossed in path."" The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are strongly associated with arid landscapes, which vividly brought up the thought of dying and being picked apart by birds, intensifying the psychological toll of the environment."
1489	7471	3	3	Well, if the setting relates to the theme, then the story will make sense and feel more cohesive, like if it’s a sad story and it’s an ugly, rainy day then the atmosphere will match very nicely, enhancing the emotional impact. The setting establishes the mood and provides a backdrop that reinforces the narrative's core ideas. That’s how the setting makes the story better and more immersive for the reader, creating a unified and powerful experience.
1490	7472	3	3	If it is hot out, you can dehydrate quickly, which is a major risk for any cyclist. Also, if the terrain is long and hilly, you use a lot of energy, making the ride much more demanding. It can be rough on your equipment, body, and mind, testing your endurance on all fronts. Make sure you dress appropriately for the conditions and carry lots of water to stay hydrated. Next, make sure your tires are properly inflated and all your equipment is working properly before you set off. Then, plan a good route that allows you to stop at places and catch a breath or drink some water to recover. Also, make sure you eat well, as food provides a lot of the necessary energy to complete your journey safely and effectively.
1491	7473	3	3	"In the setting of the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the sign had a great affect on the cyclist, reinforcing the challenging nature of his journey. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through, presenting constant physical tests. For example, the author writes, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamond back—backed across the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to ease on by, demonstrating his persistent resolve. The terrain affects the character by keeping him determined to overcome each new difficulty. This happens to many people in their sports, where external challenges fuel internal drive. For example, in football, players often take any problems, like a tough opponent or an injury, and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game, showing a similar spirit of perseverance."
1492	7474	3	3	"In the story the cyclist was affected by several key factors. The cyclist was significantly affected by the directions of the old man, which were intended to help him. It says that they gave the directions to him to help him out, suggesting it was a supposed shortcut. However, I think the cyclist believes the directions are out of date and unreliable. The reason I think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office,"" indicating his skepticism. Furthermore, the feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride up and down through what he thought of as rough terrain, a direct result of following the questionable advice. The combination of misleading directions and the difficult landscape created a challenging situation for the cyclist, which is what I think affected him the most."
1493	7475	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot, primarily through the physical environment. The terrain has a great deal to do with it, as does the oppressive heat. First, the terrain affects the cyclist significantly. It affects the cyclist because there are a lot of hills, requiring constant exertion. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill first, which demands even more effort. So, having to use the energy to pedal up steep hills affected the cyclist a lot, draining his stamina. Next, the intense heat affected the cyclist profoundly. I know this because the text says “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” highlighting the danger. This proves it is extremely hot outside, creating a hazardous condition. Heat would affect the cyclist because it prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability and leads to rapid dehydration. That is how the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist; the terrain affects him because of the exhausting hills, and the heat because it drains your energy quick, creating a doubly challenging journey."
1494	7476	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, creating a series of obstacles. One way it affected him is that the towns were old and deserted, offering no respite. In the story he said “This place might have been a thriving little spot… but it was a ghost town.” Because of this, he could not get any water or any reliable directions, leaving him isolated. Furthermore, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumpy and there were many hills to climb. The text states, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” and the cyclist had to use all his power to maneuver over these hills, which was physically taxing. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and the fact that it was a desert environment. He notes, “I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Consequently, he was hot, sweaty, and terribly thirsty from the arid heat. He was also tired and desperate to find water and a town that was not deserted, his journey defined by this need. Ultimately, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,” through the difficult roads, the deserted towns, and the critical lack of water.
1495	7477	3	3	In the story “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,” the setting is established as a long, isolated road with “no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind.” This profound isolation contributes to the cyclist's experience. The cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he has to ride down, as such terrain demands constant physical attention and effort to navigate safely. The absence of any signs of life or support along this desolate path would only amplify the difficulty of the journey, making the challenge both mental and physical as he presses forward alone. This combination of a rough road and extreme isolation defines how the setting impacts his ride.
1496	7478	3	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he “enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening”. The word “serenity” gives the affect of calm and peace, establishing a positive and hopeful beginning to his journey. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule” in a ghost town that he meets in the desert, a sight that sows the first seeds of doubt. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead”. Kurmaskie’s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low, amplifying his sense of isolation. Finally, Kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a “rather modern bathroom” where he can stop to get a drink, a simple amenity that feels like a lifesaving oasis. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie’s confidence is followed by determination and then relief, completing his emotional journey through the landscape.
1497	7479	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a desert-like place with a water shortage and he could have gotten very tired. The harsh environment posed significant physical dangers, including the threat of dehydration and exhaustion. I would never have asked old people for directions in such a situation; he should have asked someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times and might have provided more reliable, current information about the route and conditions. Also, he could have died if that snake had bitten him or from what he described as “heatstroke,” highlighting the severe risks presented by the desert setting. The cyclist's ordeal underscores the importance of preparing for and respecting the power of a natural environment.
1498	7480	3	3	The story begins as the author, a cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike-ridden destination of Yosemite National park. He starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described. It is a ghost town and amuses the author; still believing he’s perfectly fine he sets out again, this time arriving at a place with “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule”. It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is low and the promised resources are nonexistent. He proceeds past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds and different land-marks. Each one rips his confidence and excitement to shreds, especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope, a cruel irony in his parched state. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of “Gary Wilber’s fish camp,” and refreshes himself and his dried-out hope. Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health, not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out, demonstrating how the setting shaped his mental state as much as his physical one.
1499	7481	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negatively because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no sources to get a drink at. The isolation was a major factor in his distress. For example, he says “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind's”. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink, leaving him completely vulnerable to the elements. The complete absence of any sign of civilization intensified his feeling of being stranded. That is my reason why the cyclist's settings were negative, as the environment offered no relief or assistance in his time of need.
1500	7482	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder, draining his physical energy rapidly. The old people's directions made him go through the rocky way, a route that proved to be more challenging than anticipated. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, and the little he had was unpalatable. He said “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The heat could have killed him anytime, a danger he was acutely aware of. For example, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride, where the setting itself became an antagonist testing his limits and threatening his well-being. The cumulative effect of these harsh features created a perilous journey through an unforgiving landscape.
1501	7483	3	3	"The setting can greatly affect the cyclist, as the specific place can change what happens and how the events unfold. For example, if the story had taken place in Alaska, the cyclist would not have had ""wide rings of sweat circling my shirt"" and instead would have been fighting off hypothermia in the frigid cold. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing, from the physical sensations to the very challenges the character must overcome. Ultimately, the environment is a powerful force that shapes the entire narrative experience."
1502	7484	3	3	At first the terrain was fine and he felt confident on his bicycle. But when he reached the first town, it looked like one of those ghost towns in the movies, completely deserted and silent. The next town didn't come up when he was told it would, leaving him alone in the vast emptiness. The terrain was that of a desert with no water for miles, the sun beating down relentlessly. But he stayed determined, pushing through the harsh conditions. And he made it to some water though, a small oasis that saved his journey.
1503	7485	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by presenting harsh, physical obstacles. For example, he finds a ""ramshackle shed"" and tries desperately to find water within it. It affected him profoundly, because it says, ""I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything to sustain himself, showing his will to survive the unforgiving landscape."
1504	7486	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him considerably over the course of his ride. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down both physically and mentally. The narration states, “Over one long, crippling hill,” a description that reflects the writer’s feeling about his arduous adventure. Words like “long” and “crippling” show that the trip was a horrible experience, emphasizing how the difficult terrain directly contributed to his exhaustion and struggle. This demonstrates the profound impact of the physical landscape on his journey.
1505	7487	3	3	Pride, determination, relief – all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started off riding on fresh legs and with good directions, but after a while down the road he started to doubt the old men, writing “a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.” After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode on out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, noting “I gathered – a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.” This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going forward. Finally the cyclist was fatigued when he arrived at the shop because he then knew the old men were right and he would reach his destination, stating “As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink,” a moment which shows he was relieved to finally get water but also to know the men were right all along, completing his emotional journey.
1506	7488	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen. This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this, it talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. He was also sweating a lot from the physical exertion and was wiping sweat from his eyes, which intensified his feeling of dehydration. The advertisement directly appealed to his physical need, highlighting how the environment can trigger a deep sense of thirst. This connection shows the setting's power to influence his physical state and focus.
1507	7489	3	3	I work better when I can feel the environment. I think the same goes for cycling in the mountain, where the fresh air and no worries on your mind can make the activity enjoyable. The pleasant climate and the easy pace, combined with the fresh air and the fine trees, contribute significantly to the experience. The surrounding environment, with its natural beauty and tranquility, makes him feel better and more connected to the activity. For a cyclist, therefore, the environment plays a vital role in enhancing performance and overall enjoyment, proving that our surroundings are integral to our well-being.
1508	7490	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist's performance directly. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish and labored. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened; for instance, the cyclist came across a snake on the path that he was terrified of, causing his heart to race. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him with its features. For example, the clear, cool river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water to quench his thirst. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist, influencing his energy, emotions, and desires throughout the journey.
1509	7491	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discouraged the cyclist. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this town he realizes that the old man's advice might not have been so great, filling him with doubt. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most profoundly. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirsty, hot, and sweaty. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke... The cyclist's tone here is sarcastic but he is still deeply concerned about his health because of the oppressive heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him mentally. Since he talked to the old men for directions he has not seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything encouraging. So this definitely discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his difficult journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, from his physical state to his morale.
1510	7492	3	3	The cyclist tracked through a barren land trying to get to a land of rivers and valleys. Tracking through the first town, the cyclist saw a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and a corral located in the desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town, however he kept a small hope and traveled to the next destination. There, he found an abandoned fruit juice factory and bottling plant, and how discouraged the cyclist was, he started to give up completely. I was going to die, he claimed with all hope lost. The man feels like there is nothing left for him and it is the old men who caused this dire situation. Then finally, he came across a bait shop which he found on his own, giving him a huge relief and a renewed sense of possibility. The features effects his attitude because in a barren land you lose hope as did the cyclist. Therefore, what is around us affect us profoundly, as in education, friendship, and survival, shaping our journey and its outcome.
1511	7493	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected both emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. “[The] sight was troubling,” (page @NUM1) he noted, a feeling that deepened his existing fatigue. Further on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by this change in terrain. He is now exhausted but continues to pump his legs and ride on, his muscles straining with the new effort. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting now includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice, which serves as a cruel reminder of his own thirst. The author seems almost defeated by this. “I hung my head” (page @NUM2) he confessed, overwhelmed by the sight. In the end, once he finds an old fisherman's store, he is profoundly relieved. Seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because he could finally have a drink. The author's mood and body were greatly affected by the features of the setting throughout his arduous journey.
1512	7494	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and worn-out from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home. The harsh environment, with its relentless heat and difficult paths, steadily drains his energy. His struggle culminates when he then saw some buildings down a hill and said “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” (kurmaskie @NUM1), a statement that highlights his physical and mental exhaustion. After the rider finally gets home, having endured the challenging journey, he says he is going to do it again, demonstrating a resilient spirit that persists despite the hardships faced.
1513	7495	3	3	The main effect of the setting is the cyclist's lack of water. It is in June, while he is riding his bike in California. Therefore it’s going to be very hot and he’ll need a lot of water to stay hydrated, a basic need that goes unfulfilled. When he sees the abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more, taunting him with the promise of refreshment that is no longer available. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest, which compounds his physical strain. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain, which requires greater exertion. This doesn’t help his dehydration, accelerating his fatigue. That’s why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you’re riding a bike during the summer, as this narrative clearly illustrates.
1514	7496	3	3	The effects of the settings were how hot it was and the cyclist's road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, which meant it was very hot, causing him to sweat and yearn for a cool drink. And the roads were not smooth; they were very old and raggedy, full of cracks and uneven surfaces that jolted his bike and tired his body. This combination of intense heat and poor road conditions created a physically demanding and uncomfortable journey for the cyclist, significantly impacting his ride and overall experience on the path.
1515	7497	3	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” a cyclist is going against heat, a lack of water, and rough hills trying to maneuver around. The oppressive summer sun beats down on him, intensifying his thirst as his water supply runs low. Meanwhile, the rolling, uneven terrain of the hills demands constant physical effort, testing his endurance and resolve with every pedal stroke. This challenging combination of environmental factors creates a formidable obstacle course for the rider, pushing him to his physical limits throughout the narrative.
1516	7498	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is trying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiring and physically demanding. Also, the hot air can dehydrate him quickly, which can cause him to pass out from heat exhaustion. Along with the dry air, there is dry land, which means there is no place to stop for water or take a break in the shade. The rough terrain makes the biking more arduous because it involves more energy and concentration than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the middle of the road made it hazardous for the biker to go around, forcing a cautious detour. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died from its venomous poison, ending his journey tragically.
1517	7499	3	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was very hot and dry, with very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This weather affected the author profoundly because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went, his thirst growing with every mile. The relentless sun beat down, offering no respite from the heat, which sapped his strength and increased his discomfort. The arid environment, devoid of any streams or sources of liquid, intensified his physical struggle. His journey became a test of endurance against the elements, where the lack of hydration was a constant and dangerous companion."
1518	7500	3	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house, as their knowledge of the area is outdated. For example in the story it says, “Never accept travel advice from collection of old timers who haven’t left confines of their porches since carter was in office.” This affecting the setting because if it weren’t for his map and let them take a peek at it, that would of saved him a load of trouble and misdirection. Their well-intentioned but incorrect guidance sent him on a more difficult path than necessary. Ultimately, relying on his own resources would have been the wiser choice for navigating the unfamiliar terrain.
1519	7501	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining, posing a significant challenge. In the text it says “Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees” this proves that the cyclist is exaggerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California, emphasizing the extreme heat. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.” This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out, highlighting the scarcity of resources. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best, as the harsh environment demands respect and foresight.
1520	7502	3	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water, draining his energy reserves. For example, in the story it says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view”. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over, a major obstacle. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over, pushing him to his limits. Another setting feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water, increasing his isolation. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey, amplifying his vulnerability. It shows this in the story when he say, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. Also it says in the story “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it, leading to a deep sense of despair. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him, a vivid fear born from the complete emptiness of the landscape. He was obviously worried about the absence of people and the dangers of such profound solitude."
1521	7503	3	3	Usually the features and setting have a major affect upon the cyclist. The features and setting relate to and describe the harsh, and eventually relieving, condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe and interpret. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced by the cyclist. For example, the cool pines and no one in sight emphasize that the cyclist is alone. The way this interprets a clear meaning is that the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water to fill his thirst. Prior to this, the features show the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that he believed it was his last burst of energy, as he constantly maneuvered down the hill. The features and settings affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understanding for the cyclist, and what is to be expected by him on his arduous journey.
1522	7504	3	3	"The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the “old timers” were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardly noticed.” He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him drink his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" He was so thirsty that he would have drunk the hot water. Then he thought he had only a few miles to go, so he kept going. He was weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain, trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state. With what little energy he had left, he had passed an abandoned well by a Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to gathering up a few pebbles and sticking them in his mouth just to keep his mind off his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp best bet,” and then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he had learned his lesson, to stick to his map and be better prepared."
1523	7505	3	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. When he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to a specific location. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He chose to take their advice but later regretted it. When he found the towns that they spoke of, all he found was ghost towns. He concludes, ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" He does eventually reach a town where he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, and the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was plagued by the sun and lack of water. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. When he reached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began losing consciousness, fearing he could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. This experience underscored the perilous nature of his journey."
1524	7506	3	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast or as slow as he pedals, and the setting dictates this pace significantly. If the setting is a humid, sunny day he can’t go too fast due to his lung capacity and the strain of the heat. If it is a warm but windy day he has to watch his speed to keep from getting hurt or losing control. Basically, unless the weather is nice or safe enough he will not be able to go very fast. But his safety comes first so it depends on the weather mostly, but also the time of the day. If it is night and dark, reflectors must be put on to keep from getting hit by passing vehicles, ensuring a safer ride under those specific conditions.
1525	7507	3	3	The features in the setting are affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the difficult terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the horrendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more, and throughout the story he was trying desperately to find some water. The water he did find was about “two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid,” which was nearly undrinkable. If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat, demonstrating how the environment directly challenges his endurance.
1526	7508	3	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. The long, arduous hill is one example, presenting a significant physical challenge. The snake and the uneven dirt road are two more obstacles that demand his attention and energy. The oppressive heat of the desert is another formidable element, and his depleting water supply, which causes growing concern, are all examples of features that directly affected him and his journey.
1527	7509	3	3	"There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states ""rough road ahead,"" warning him of the difficult terrain to come. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long onpiling hill,"" describing the exhausting climb he faced. He also noted the temperature, as started on page @NUM5, and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7: ""I was traveling in the high deserts of California in June,"" indicating the severe climate. These harsh conditions of the setting all significantly effect the cyclist and his progress."
1528	7510	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke” (@NUM1). This quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding and his health. The narrarator also says, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”(@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is saying that he is dehydrated and is having trouble keeping his balance on the rough terrain, which slows him down. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist in this story.
1529	7511	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by creating a desire to go longer and continue riding the bike to discover what is up ahead. However, by riding a bike in the intense heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the extreme temperatures. That is why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike, as the environment directly dictates the necessary precautions for survival and success.
1530	7512	3	3	The cyclist's settings hinder him in the essay “Rough Road Ahead.” The cyclist is in the desert in the summer time with hardly any water, which creates a constant physical strain. He is trying to find his way to Yosemite, but he gets lost along the way because some old men gave him bad directions, adding to his challenges. During this time he is riding his bicycle for miles and miles in the scorching heat of the summer. His overwhelming thoughts of thirst get in the way of him trying to continue on to find Yosemite, breaking his concentration. I believe that if the cyclist was in a cooler environment then things would have been different because his settings were sort of a distraction to him and his ultimate goal.
1531	7513	3	3	The cyclist became profoundly tired, and the harsh desert area he was traversing in June offered no relief at all. The day was scorchingly hot, and every town he had come across was completely abandoned, devoid of any source of water. The terrain was also relentlessly hilly, which made the arduous physical work of pedaling even harder and more draining on his depleted energy reserves. The combination of the extreme heat, the unforgiving landscape, and the complete lack of resources created a truly formidable challenge for his journey.
1532	7514	3	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" critically affect the cyclist because they determine how easy or hard his ride ultimately is. For example, the land being intensely hot would enable him to die of heatstroke without water, while the land being dry means he does not have a place to refill his dwindling water supply. Furthermore, the land being barren means to the man that if he did not succumb to heat stroke, there is a significant chance he would not be found and would not survive. Another example of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed limit sign; his thoughts are about how he is going a water-depleting 12 mph. This shows that the features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness of the road, make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibly be the biggest arrest on a cyclist, and they determine whether they have a long, hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit like in this story or a nice, leisurely ride."
1533	7515	3	3	"The cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was definitely affected by the setting in multiple ways. He was cycling in California—which is a hot place to begin with—in June, which made it even hotter as he came upon a hot desert. When you are doing a strenuous physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the oppressive heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water, which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get unbearably hot and he was completely out of water. This affected his body by making him dangerously tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself and his ability to continue. Then there was the abandoned juice building where they had once made juice. He said, “In an ironic twist abandoned years earlier had been a Welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant.” He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant, a cruel reminder of his need. The cyclist was definitely affected by his surroundings both mentally—by thinking “I’m going to die.”—and physically by becoming severely dehydrated from the harsh environment."
1534	7516	3	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry, and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as being “In the high deserts of California in June.” It was dry, lifeless, and intensely hot. The sun was beating down on him relentlessly and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out quickly. The empty towns were what he was counting on for fresh water, but they had been long abandoned, leaving him without hope for resupply. This made his journey very dangerous, as he could have fallen off his bike at any time because of heat stroke. He would have died right then and there in the isolated landscape. His sweat was drying instantly in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert, which was both lifeless and dry. He had to endure these extreme, ironic conditions for miles on end, just to find some life-saving water. It was everything that a desert is and all that a person should not have to go through on such a demanding trip.
1535	7517	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, creating a series of formidable obstacles. The hills are too long and steep, making the climb exhausting. Every town he passes is completely abandoned, offering no shelter or supplies, and the roads are rough and difficult to navigate. The intense, unrelenting heat also affects him significantly, bearing down without mercy. He is affected health wise, as the physical strain and environmental conditions take a severe toll on his body and well-being, pushing him to his absolute limits. The cumulative effect of these harsh setting features creates a profoundly challenging and hazardous experience for the lone cyclist.
1536	7518	3	3	"When you are doing any sport or anything where you sweat, your setting is everything. If you are sweating in a harsh setting, you can easily get sick from factors like extreme heat and a lack of resources. The setting from the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" demonstrates this clearly, as the cyclist had no water and the setting was very hot and unforgiving. That is why the cyclist was tired and sick, because he was sweating profusely in the heat and had no water to replenish his fluids. That is precisely how the setting negatively affected the cyclist, showing the critical importance of environment on physical exertion."
1537	7519	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. The features include old abandoned towns and hot temperatures, along with dilapidated and abandoned buildings. This desolate environment makes the cyclist think all hope is lost, reinforcing his despair. The essay says this: “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune 'summertime rattle around.'” Then, in an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building, by the looks of it, had been a Welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant. The sight initially deepened his melancholy, as noted by the line, “I hung my head that smoky blues tune summertime rattle around.” Then, his mood shifted to a happy one when the text states, “As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This shows how the setting's features directly triggered a shift from despair to relief and gratitude.
1538	7520	3	3	With no one around and a rough road ahead, not to mention severe dehydration, the cyclist began to feel he was going to die. Because of this dire situation, he began to doubt himself and his ability to continue. However, each time he saw something on the horizon, a building or any sign of potential respite, he tried to get there, pushing forward despite his overwhelming fatigue and despair. This cycle of doubt and determination, driven entirely by the features of the setting, defined his arduous journey and his struggle for survival.
1539	7521	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June, a time of intense heat. This caused the cyclist to become overheated and sweaty, so he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” he had nowhere to fill his bottles and thus became dangerously dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from a flat road to “short, rolling hills.” Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed “crippling” and insurmountable. My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps existed in the time period the old men had lived in, with more resources available, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable and less arduous experience. The environment was the primary factor in his suffering.
1540	7522	3	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pity are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite Park because of its peacefulness and contrasting environment. He said, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.” He wanted to get there because it was so hot where he was currently cycling. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of a hot water hole, but it was undrinkable: “I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.” He was running out of water, so he got desperate for some, no matter the source. He also started to have self-pity, thinking, “sometimes life can be so cruel.” He was feeling pity for himself because he had such a long way to go still under such difficult conditions. These are all feelings the cyclist experienced directly because of the challenging and unforgiving setting.
1541	7523	3	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist’s moods in many ways, as the story illustrates. About forty miles into the pedal, he arrived at the first ""town,"" likely already tired from the long journey. Discovering the town was deserted made him a little frustrated. This feeling was compounded when the next few stops were also deserted, and with his water supply almost gone, he became desperate. The physical challenges of the setting intensified as the road became bumpy and a large snake blocked his way, terrifying him. Finally, reaching a bait shop with cool water provided a profound sense of relief. As this progression shows, the cyclist goes through many distinct moods, each directly caused by the evolving setting of the story."
1542	7524	3	3	The way the features of the setting affected the cyclist is that the journey takes place in June in the middle of the desert, a time of extreme heat. This harsh environment was a primary source of his hardship. Also, he was given wrong or misleading information, which further complicated his difficult situation and left him ill-prepared for the challenges he faced on his arduous journey.
1543	7525	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surroundings. The climate was that of the desert in June, which was very hot with little available water, a condition that made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that “helped” him accused him of being responsible for the difficult guiding situation he was in, adding to his distress. There were no surrounding shops or buildings that were inhabited, leaving no place for him to get any water or nourishment. These combined elements of the setting created a profoundly challenging experience for the cyclist throughout his journey.
1544	7526	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several key moments. When the story says “Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts,” this statement affected the cyclist because he didn’t know which way to go, creating uncertainty. Another feature is when the story says “I got on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” That statement shows the cyclist was dying for water and doubted any would come out, highlighting his desperation. The last feature is when a sign read, “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This shows the rider had to go under a speed limit, but being already tired and traveling slowly, he was concerned about whether he could make it up the difficult rough road ahead.
1545	7527	3	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in has many cacti and vast, empty stretches of land. This barren landscape contributes to a feeling of isolation and physical challenge, as the terrain offers little respite or resources for a traveler. The harsh, sun-scorched environment profoundly shapes his difficult experience on the journey.
1546	7528	3	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a vast, arid desert which severely dehydrated him and profoundly changed his mood. Going through this unforgiving desert, he completely ran out of water and was forced to stop. Some of the small, dusty towns he had been told of turned out to be completely deserted, and as he could not find any water there, he soon became dangerously dehydrated. This is the most obvious physical affect the setting had on him, but another significant affect was to cause him to doubt the reliability of old people and to change his overall mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the relentless desert, desperately clinging to life in hopes he could find a source of water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future, as they don’t get out into the ever-changing world as much as they used to, whereas at the beginning of his journey he had been entirely confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. Ultimately, the harsh setting he was in made him a little more wise about the world and his own place within it.
1547	7529	3	3	Because the setting of the cyclist's ride is a dry, unforgiving desert, it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined as he presses onward. He is going against the formidable odds of the environment, so it seems like he is pushing himself to his absolute physical and mental limit. Against the oppressive heat and the long, empty road he's on, and having no water left, all seems lost for the cyclist as despair begins to set in. But in the end, through sheer force of will, he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself, finding a final reserve of strength to triumph over the adversity and complete his arduous journey.
1548	7530	3	3	From reading the story, I believe the setting of the desert he was cycling through affected him immensely, primarily in the way his attitude changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and sufficiently hydrated for the challenge ahead. As time and miles went on, however, the monotonous scenery never changed, which can be really hard on the spirit. In heated conditions, you need to be as hydrated as possible, especially when enduring a strenuous physical activity. When time went on, he was getting dangerously low on water and had nothing else to think about for long stretches other than how much farther he had to go, how profoundly thirsty he was, and questioning if this entire effort was worth it. It is a lot harder to stay motivated when there is nothing to look at to keep your mind off the struggle, and the attitude of the cyclist certainly changed for the worst. In my point of view, I strongly believe that this shift could have been from working his way across the sandy desert for what seemed a long period of time. I have some experience in exercising while in a monotonous setting; it’s hard to see the same thing for miles and miles. My own attitude will go from “I’m so determined” to “I’m bored” to “what’s the point.” But I thought it was great how he never gave up even when things got incredibly bad. It opened my eyes to see how rewarding it is to reach your own goals through such perseverance.
1549	7531	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by severely dehydrating him and presenting physical obstacles. The cyclist said, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,"" indicating the harsh and unexpected challenges of the desert landscape. The cyclist was in the heart of the desert and with each grueling mile he rode, he became more and more dehydrated. The relentless desert sun was steadily drying out his body, sapping his strength. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” showing that the more he went on, the more the desert's harsh features affected him and dehydrated him, pushing him closer to his physical limits."
1550	7532	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, influencing his decisions and the path he took. One way is that the cyclist ended up not sticking to his original, carefully planned map. Instead of sticking to his map, he had asked a couple of old people for local advice. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also kindly offered him a supposed short cut to take, which seemed promising at the time. That’s where the second effect came in, as the cyclist started to use this unverified shortcut instead of the main road, a decision directly prompted by the local features and the people within that setting. That’s how the specific features of the setting ultimately affected the cyclist's journey and the choices he made along the way.
1551	7533	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing” (kurmaskie). The smooth pavement gave way to a rough, uneven surface, and the gentle slopes were replaced by steeper, more challenging hills. Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions were changing, the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries, maintaining his pace and resolve. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey, proving his determination was greater than the obstacles he faced.
1552	7534	3	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run-down factory, its windows broken and its yard littered with debris. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This feature of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind about the journey's end. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is hot and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads, which saps his energy. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable, being warm and tasting of rust. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason his health is at risk from the harsh environment.
1553	7535	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is the condition of the roads, which were cracked and covered in gravel. Another is the heat, which was relentless and sapped his strength. Another is snakes, posing a potential threat on the lonely path. Another is no town in sight for long stretches, increasing his isolation. The final one is lack of info, as he had no clear map or signs to guide him. Maybe the guy made it, or maybe he got hurt on the ride. Maybe a snake bit him, or perhaps the heat overcame him. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways throughout his difficult journey.
1554	7536	3	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and deserted. The description could suggest loneliness, obviously, with vast empty spaces stretching to the horizon. Even though the man was all alone and didn’t know where he was going, he still persisted, pushing forward on his bicycle. While he thought about “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” he used this mental image as a source of motivation. This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying despite the challenging and isolating landscape that surrounded him on all sides.
1555	7537	3	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts and the air is dry. There was also a snake, which could have bit and killed him, adding a constant element of danger to his ride. As the roads were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him, requiring more effort to navigate the broken asphalt. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot, gross water that was unfit to drink. Each of these environmental challenges tested his endurance and resolve throughout the journey.
1556	7538	3	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself, his confidence buoyed by the clear instructions from the old men. He sees everything exactly as the old men told him, which reinforces his initial certainty. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty, a stark and unsettling contrast to the described route. “There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The man started becoming very unsure, his earlier confidence quickly eroding. You could tell he says “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.” He was very doubtful he’d get to where he was going, fearing he was utterly lost. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water, a sanctuary that finally ended his arduous and uncertain trek.
1557	7539	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story a lot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist received bad information on how to get to his destination which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water, setting him up for a dire situation from the very beginning. He says in the story “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2”. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering, a dangerous rate of consumption. Another feature of the setting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse until he reached a highway late in his journey, each mile becoming progressively more challenging. He said “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy to ride terrain was replaced by slower, harder to ride on terrain that demanded greater physical exertion. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe fatal and affected the cyclist a lot, ultimately defining the perilous nature of his experience."
1558	7540	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surroundings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasn’t so sure if he should keep going, the desolation planting seeds of doubt in his mind. As well as when he didn’t see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope, the complete absence of life making his goal feel more distant and impossible. But as a second road sign appeared he was relieved, its familiar markings restoring a small but crucial measure of his confidence and direction.
1559	7541	3	3	The setting in this short story causes the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack thereof, a fundamental need that becomes his primary obsession. The cyclist has no water and thinks it’s only a matter of time before he dies, his mind fixated on this grim outcome. Another big problem is the rough terrain, which saps his remaining strength and slows his progress to a painful crawl. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome, each bump and hill a fresh challenge. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him, the profound isolation compounding his physical struggles with psychological despair. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would’ve been no one there to help, a stark reminder of how vulnerable and alone he truly was in that unforgiving landscape.
1560	7542	3	3	The features of the setting of “Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills, it introduces a new layer of physical hardship. It makes it difficult for him to bike, forcing him to stand on his pedals and strain. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills, precious energy he cannot afford to waste. Another example is when it says “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair, emphasizing his solitude. Lastly, he sees the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier, a cruel taunt to his dehydrated state. All of these things affect the cyclist, each one chipping away at his resolve. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned, highlighting the stark contrast between his desperate needs and the setting's unyielding refusal to provide for them.
1561	7543	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways, primarily through the harsh desert environment. The first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water, a situation made more dire by the relentless sun. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it, which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, a fact he acknowledges by stating, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit.” Next up is the rough terrain, which presents a physical challenge that compounds his distress. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water, a cruel irony highlighted when “a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel.” Finally is the structure of the settlements he encounters. First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water, a bitter disappointment. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably diminishing, their abandoned state a mockery of his thirst. “A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.” As you can see the features of the settings generally affected the cyclist, each one layering on another difficulty to test his resolve.
1562	7544	3	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests that challenge his perspective. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny “old codgers” and their crazy ideas, finding humor in the desolation. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn’t the least bit established anymore, he’s slightly disappointed, but sees it as “a test of [his] inner spirit,” transforming letdown into a personal challenge. At the third building, an abandoned factory, he still appreciates the irony of the situation, recognizing the absurdity amidst the disappointment. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself further along his journey. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing, demonstrating a resilient and optimistic outlook throughout his arduous trek.
1563	7545	3	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewhat grim as he only expects the worst from his surroundings. The rough road starts out after a water pump he finds gives him piping hot, brackish water that tasted like battery acid, a pivotal moment of disappointment. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor for his life, and is the source for him living, its quality mirroring his changing fortunes. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself, marking a descent into hardship. The cyclist in this story is very aware of how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration, a constant physical concern. At one point he says “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly as the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down, leaving him isolated and demoralized."
1564	7546	3	3	The desert is the cruelest of nature’s environments, presenting a formidable challenge to any traveler. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature, demanding constant vigilance. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature; in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” cyclist Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive this very test. As the author observes, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke,” a clear sign of his body’s distress. If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function, a dangerous state in such isolation. Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, noting “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance, his condition deteriorating rapidly. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe grimly observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear,” a stark reminder of the stakes of his journey.
1565	7547	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed the Posted Speed limit” affect the cyclist in a cruel manner, each one designed to test his spirit. The old men say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns, setting him up for inevitable disappointment. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists that drain his resources. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read “The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph” This lowers the cyclist's confidence making him seem more worried about his slow, arduous progress. Another cruel thing is the author adding a Welch’s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” totally causing him to lose hope left as he confronted the irony. These features in setting are cruel, collectively working to undermine his morale and physical endurance on the journey.
1566	7548	3	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next ìtownî and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welchís factory, abandoned and silent, with no one to offer aid. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming ìthe birds will pick me clean,î To the cyclist also was best, then he was ìsavedî by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned, providing a final, crucial respite from the unforgiving landscape.
1567	7549	3	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by, demonstrating his sheer will to continue. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined and focused on his goal. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game, using adversity as a source of inner strength."
1568	7550	3	3	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster, sapping his energy with its relentless heat. Also fones are scarce, leaving him isolated and without a means to call for help. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, ìthe negg down was only @NUM1 down the road, a distance that proved deceptive in the vast emptiness. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage, as the shimmering heat played tricks on his weary mind and blurred the line between reality and desperate illusion.
1569	7551	3	3	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh, lifting his spirits momentarily. In the essay, it says, ì on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.î This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude and a brief respite from his ordeal. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration, becoming a direct threat to his life. ì growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke î This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might, creating a constant undercurrent of fear. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways, from providing joy to imposing mortal danger.
1570	7552	3	3	In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced sedring heat, dyhdration and getting wrong directions that led him astray. He experienced depression and mear death, feeling completely defeated by the environment. He had an encounter with a big old snake that blocked his path and last he reached his distination, exhausted but alive. This affected him profoundly and he learned to bring a map and not to take direction from old people, a hard-won lesson about preparation and self-reliance forged in the crucible of the desert.
1571	7553	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremely hot, as he notes, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” He claims it didn’t affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated, so internally it affected him significantly. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him and posed a physical obstacle. He describes how “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” an encounter that could not have made his ride easier. Next, the challenging terrain of the hills and roads added to his struggle, with one described as “over one long, crippling hill.” This proves how intense and physically demanding his ride was. Ultimately, the cumulative effect of these environmental factors significantly impacted the cyclist's journey in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie.
1572	7554	3	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. The main things that impact him are the intense heat, his lack of water, the absence of nearby buildings, and the wildlife. For this cyclist, one of the biggest problems is the oppressive heat. He states he “was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,” which shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is a very hot month, especially in California's deserts. The second problem is the cyclist's lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink. When he reaches the end, however, he finally finds water. The third problem is that when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere to get it due to the complete lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby, but once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the wildlife. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The wildlife is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination. Truly, the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a traumatizing way, because so many challenging elements like the heat, lack of water, buildings, and wildlife are constantly impeding his progress.
1573	7555	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because in California it can be extremely hot. The cyclist could easily dehydrate on such a long trip through the desert and potentially pass out or get seriously hurt. The text implies the severity of the heat and its physical consequences. Also, the terrain presents a major challenge, as there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist, requiring immense physical effort to climb. These combined factors of harsh climate and difficult geography create a profoundly challenging journey for the rider, demonstrating how the environment directly impacts his experience.
1574	7556	3	3	In the essay, the author included many features that could be identified about the cyclist's journey. One feature was that his water supply was running short, which shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking to stay hydrated. Another feature would be the discovery of a rusty old pipe with bad water; this shows that the town had been abandoned for years and the water supply wasn't safe for drinking. These details highlight the scarcity of resources and the desolate nature of the surroundings. The essay in all shows how hard it is to travel in hot weather with a lack of supplies and no clear sense of direction, ultimately painting a picture of a grueling and precarious expedition.
1575	7557	3	3	The cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had to go through a hard time in the California desert. It was hard for him primarily because it was very hot in the desert in June, and he was almost out of water, leading to dehydration. At first his ride was easier on flat ground, which provided some initial relief. But when he came to rolling hills, the terrain changed drastically and he had to use much more energy to continue, significantly increasing the physical difficulty of his journey. This combination of extreme heat, scarce water, and demanding hills made his passage through the desert a truly arduous ordeal.
1576	7558	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was already really thirsty, and then the dry, dusty air with no town or water source nearby made his condition even worse. The relentless sun beat down, offering no relief. There were also the bumpy, unpaved roads and the steep, unending hills that were physically tiring, and the exertion made the cyclist even thirstier. Finally, there was the sight of the factory in the distance, its smokestacks a cruel reminder of industry, which made him think about cold, refreshing juice and consequently made him thirstier yet, amplifying his suffering on the long journey.
1577	7559	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by presenting an environment where old people reinforce the traditional advice of ""don’t talk to strangers,"" creating a social barrier. The main character, navigating this isolated area, finds that the secluded houses and the cautious demeanor of the elderly residents discourage any interaction. This atmosphere of quiet suspicion and adherence to old-fashioned rules directly influences the cyclist's journey, making him feel more alone and unable to seek assistance or companionship, thereby shaping his solitary experience."
1578	7560	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because a real cyclist inherently knows what a suitable speed is for a bike on a given terrain, so external instruction is unnecessary. If a cyclist truly needed some directions, they would logically go to a public place like a gas station, not to some old person’s isolated house. A real cyclist possesses the endurance to go as long as they want before needing to stop, driven only by their own fatigue. A real cyclist knows how to perform tricks on a bike and does not have to practice them over and over again just to be able to execute them. Ultimately, a real cyclist does not have to undergo formal training to enter a tournament and win; they simply must have practiced consistently to be able to win, relying on their ingrained skill and experience.
1579	7561	3	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot, deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired and discouraged. For example, the cyclist observes, ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him and signaled a lack of resources. Also, the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his profound isolation, and begins to become more determined to simply reach his destination. If you have ever been lost, then you know that it can be deeply discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can eventually find your way. This feeling of desolate determination is shown through the cyclist, and now the setting around him directly affects his mental state and his journey."
1580	7562	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the harsh daylight and the bright, glaring sun bothers the cyclist, making the ride more uncomfortable. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, no signs of civilization, he felt profoundly frustrated. The quote, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” emphasizes the utter emptiness. If something, like a simple landmark or a distant farmhouse, were there, he wouldn’t feel as frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find some help or his way. The complete absence of any point of reference deepened his sense of being lost and alone.
1581	7563	3	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. It was hot, so hot in fact, that the author realized he could “drop from heatstroke” at any time. This unbearable heat, coupled with the “crippling” hilly terrain, was enough to reduce the cyclist to a state of severe dehydration, obviously not exerting a positive effect. The sweltering heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest, and replenish his dwindling water supply. However, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind.” The cyclist was in complete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the searing sun beating down upon him as he toiled up steep, unyielding hills. The complete absence of any refuge or aid in this harsh environment clearly shows the setting was affecting the cyclist in a horribly negative way, pushing him to his physical limits."
1582	7564	3	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worse when your surroundings are at their worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water, it is a day with nothing around him to help, no stores or houses in sight. Also with no water he could pass out and get dehydrated, a serious risk in such an isolated place. When he finds no one to help and nothing around him, he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth somewhat hydrated, a desperate measure born from his dire circumstances. Therefore, you should always check your destination and the route on a bike before just going for it, as proper planning could prevent such a dangerous and dehydrating situation.
1583	7565	3	3	It is very difficult to be outside in extreme heat, let alone exercise by riding a bike, especially when ignoring advice from old folks who warn against it. If it feels like it is @NUM1 degrees outside, you don’t need to be out there engaging in strenuous activity. It doesn't matter how long you are outside for; a heatstroke could come at anybody faster than they can count to @NUM2, striking suddenly and without much warning. The intense heat poses a severe and immediate threat to anyone who is not adequately prepared or who chooses to ignore common sense, making it a dangerous environment for physical exertion.
1584	7566	3	3	On the way to @CAPS1, the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough, unforgiving terrain. This harsh environment was making him increasingly tired and dangerously dehydrated as he pressed on. Halfway through his journey, he couldn't see anything for miles—no signs of life or civilization—which must have been incredibly discouraging and isolating. All the way there he was plagued by dehydration, and when he finally found water, it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the relentless, pervasive heat, offering little refreshment. This entire difficult experience underscores the physical toll exacted by the challenging conditions of his ride.
1585	7567	3	3	Hot, bumpy roads, and no shade are all things that negatively affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in the area and then the sun started beating down on him; he said it “felt like the desert,” considering it was so intensely hot. The road was fine at first, and then he got a while down the road and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on, jarring his body and slowing his progress. The part where he has no shade has to be terrible because he has the sun beating down on him all the time, with no reprieve from the scorching rays. All of these are reasons why the cyclist shouldn’t have taken those particular directions in the first place, as they led him into such an arduous and unforgiving environment.
1586	7568	3	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. The words “high deserts of California in June” from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist gets very tired, and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water from, so if you don’t have water you don’t have anything, leading to severe dehydration. Also, the cyclist suffers the pain and difficulty of having to drive on, over, and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead,” which warned of the uneven and broken pavement. There were also obstacles such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around, adding to the physical strain and constant vigilance required. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist's life in danger, but because of his dedication and perseverance he ultimately got through it.
1587	7569	3	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” profoundly affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" which introduced a new and demanding challenge. The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job a lot harder, requiring more energy and strength to pedal uphill. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope, as each new hill seemed to sap his remaining morale. The relentless terrain thus became a major obstacle to his progress and his spirit."
1588	7570	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going uphill, demanding great physical exertion. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water, creating a sense of urgency and fear. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride through the arid landscape. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them significantly. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey, causing fatigue and mental fog. Together, these environmental features created a formidable test of the cyclist's endurance.
1589	7571	3	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles, feeling confident and secure. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the next town there is no one around, creating a sense of isolation. There are no buildings in sight at all and no source of water, which heightens his anxiety. Since there was no one around his confidence of actually completing the trip began to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old ghost town and no one was there anymore, deepening his disappointment. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought he'd never make it and that he would die from exposure. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting with signs of life. There were people around, offering a stark contrast to the emptiness before. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water and assistance. Ultimately, the setting with no one around made him lose a lot of confidence, highlighting how isolation can break a person's spirit.
1590	7572	3	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather, greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclist's trip either easier or harder, directly influencing their pace and morale. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, while rain and bad road conditions could force a cyclist to go slower for safety. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down as he searched for resources. Rough roads did as well, jarring his body and damaging his bike. Hills and animals on the road, like snakes crossing his path, slowed down the cyclist even more, requiring constant stops and detours. The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features seriously impaired his bike ride, turning it into a grueling test of survival.
1591	7573	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, directly influencing his ride and his physical state. If it was a straight and paved road, it would be smooth sailing, allowing for consistent speed. If the road was bumpy and full of potholes, he’d jump up and down a little, jostled with every rotation of the wheels. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark, with the shade from the canopy providing a brief respite. If he was riding in the desert under the direct sun, it would be very hot and bright, creating a harsh and unforgiving environment. Each type of terrain presents its own distinct set of challenges for the journey.
1592	7574	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly affect the cyclist, impacting both his physical endurance and his mental state. I’m sure that the intense heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and such heat can also drain energy extremely fast, leaving him feeling weak. Being in “the california desert in the middle of June” does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike, as the sun is relentless. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I’m sure that riding past all of the empty, barren land had a profound effect on his attitude, fostering a sense of isolation. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, sparking a flicker of hope, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn’t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned, crushing his morale each time. When the cyclist finally reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke, a moment of true salvation.
1593	7575	3	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome, testing his resolve at every turn. When he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty, a devastating discovery. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid,"" offering only a bitter, undrinkable liquid. The second drink source he passed was an abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory, a cruel reminder of what he needed. The text says, “a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which served as a tantalizing and mocking image. These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away, deepening his sense of despair with each failed attempt."
1594	7576	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, which demands more effort, the elderly men’s directions and most importantly his growing, pervasive thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for times when he really needs it, rationing each precious drop. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, scanning the horizon desperately, which he finally does in the end at the bait shop. He’s also a little bit angry and disappointed with the old men’s directions, feeling they have led him astray. He’s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directions, and he's beginning to wonder if they’ve lost it, questioning their reliability as his fatigue sets in. This doubt adds a significant mental burden to his already difficult physical journey.
1595	7577	3	3	There are many different features of a setting that can affect a cyclist, such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling at the time. The weather can effect if it is raining, making the path slick, or whether the roads are messed up with debris where he could get a flat tire, abruptly halting his progress. The way that the person is feeling is a big part on whether they try hard to push through the discomfort or they do not worry about it too much and perhaps slow their pace. All of these elements combine to shape the overall experience and difficulty of the ride for the individual cyclist.
1596	7578	3	3	According to the essay, the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example, the author states, “I had been hitting my bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June.” The terrain then changes to short, rolling hills from flat land, causing the cyclist to push herself to get to the next town for water. For instance, she states, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” This causes the cyclist to use what they thought was their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel profoundly let down. As the cyclist continued on, a setting of a bait store appeared, and the cyclist felt immense relief because now she could finally get water. These examples clearly show the change of setting on the cyclist’s trip and how it directly affected her physical and emotional state.
1597	7579	3	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the ‘short cut’ that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer and more reliable route. These old men had no clue what they were really talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles and difficult terrain. When the cyclist was in desperate need of more water, he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" Unfortunately, no water would come out of these pumps, so he had no choice but to keep going without any water. As he moved forward in his travels, he said that the “Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.” Without any water, he did not have much strength left to face the rolling hills, but he had no other option. The cyclist had to go on for miles without seeing anyone or anything. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,"" he observed. His troubles finally came to an end after getting helpful directions from another man at a fish camp, which led him back toward civilization."
1598	7580	3	3	The setting adds a powerful sense of urgency to the cyclist's predicament. The cyclist is running out of water, and he is in the middle of the desert, an environment that intensifies his peril. If he had been in a forest or the suburbs, the situation would not be so grave or life-threatening. He talks about the very real possibility of passing out and dying, revealing his despair. He exclaims, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean.” This grim thought highlights how the harsh, unforgiving desert setting directly contributes to his feeling of hopelessness and the critical nature of his struggle for survival.
1599	7581	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was significantly affected by the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was sound and reliable, but it ultimately proved to be wrong. This misguided advice led him astray, taking him off the correct track from the good path he was trying to reach. Consequently, the journey became more difficult than he had anticipated, demonstrating how external influences and incorrect information can negatively impact one's progress and goals on a challenging route.
1600	7582	3	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very cruel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left their porch in decades, so the information was outdated. Once he accepted the directions and used them, a series of problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist’s severe lack of water supply in the arid landscape. Also, the cyclist has frightening encounters with snakes along the way. Another issue is that the directions were way off, so he had a much longer distance to travel than he originally thought. Furthermore, when he finally arrived at his anticipated destination from his arduous journey, he found only a deserted town, offering no respite. So in conclusion, the cyclist learns a hard lesson and uses his own directions from now on to avoid such treacherous and misleading settings.
1601	7583	3	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. The landscape itself began to shift, becoming more barren and imposing. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often, watching his supply diminish with growing alarm. He said that, “He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die, a direct consequence of the unforgiving environment. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink, a moment of profound relief. From then on he stuck to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story, a direct reflection of the challenges presented by the setting."
1602	7584	3	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is affected a lot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. “Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1.” This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on, forcing him to exert more energy with every pedal stroke. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. The physical strain caused by the changing landscape directly impacts his morale and physical capacity. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist, proving to be a formidable obstacle on his journey."
1603	7585	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty, a desperate measure born from his growing desperation. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks, a bizarre thought that highlights his disoriented state. The reason for that was that he was so hot, the intense and relentless heat clouding his judgment. He didn’t even no where he was goin, completely lost in the vast, featureless desert. The oppressive heat was the primary factor in his physical and mental decline.
1604	7586	3	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster under the scorching sun. Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions, turning potential oases into mirages of disappointment. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help, isolating him completely in a harsh and unresponsive landscape. Each element of the environment conspired against his progress and well-being.
1605	7587	3	3	The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily, a constant threat on his journey. The intense heat can cause that to, accelerating his physical exhaustion. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop from sharp debris or the relentless, sun-baked pavement. These environmental factors collectively create a journey fraught with physical danger and mechanical uncertainty, each one a potential point of failure.
1606	7588	3	3	The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park, and he listened to the “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” Trusting their local knowledge, he went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill into a town which was empty and quiet, then onto a hard road where he had to dodge snakes in his way. After climbing another hill, he went down the other side and saw an abandoned “Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,” a sight that deepened his sense of isolation. Before he got there he was getting thirsty and tired, and when he saw the abandoned building he saw a young boy drinking a juice; he wiped his eyes to see if he wasn’t seeing a mirage. His thirst growing unbearable, he then sticks a few pebbles into his mouth, having read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left, but a stone went down his throat, causing a moment of panic. Yet, his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him when he saw that sign for “Gary And Wilber’s FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE YOUR BEST BET!” promising the relief of civilization ahead.
1607	7589	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, primarily through the oppressive environmental conditions. One feature of the setting was the intense, unrelenting heat. It affected him by getting him severely dehydrated, sapping his strength and clouding his thoughts. For example, the text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips; I could drop from a heatstroke.” This meant the heat was getting to him, pushing him toward a physical breaking point where even a few drops of water became a critical resource. The setting's harsh climate thus directly shaped his difficult and perilous experience on the journey.
1608	7590	3	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, full of undesirable heat and a profound lack of water at hand. This feeling is specially conveyed in the way he kept describing the road with all the challenges that kept appearing, like after several miles to a town and then more miles passed that he, “came to a park of ramshackle sheds, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the tamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling.” Then he went in a discharge of despair, writing, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. One can imagine the heat, and the unbearableness of the journey still I face."" The bike seemed endless under the sun. Then with a thirst gaining on him, for example, ""I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph, sanctuaries of life can seem so cruel."" This made him feel his constraints, a regret for the journey he had undertaken. It made the reader feel a constrained sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I ripped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"" upon seeing a building abandoned years ago. This made his journey seem hopeless and long, an endless road with the first wave of problems getting at his strength. His journey seemed to be harder and filled with little hope as his strength left him, making it difficult to finish his goals and reach his destination."
1609	7591	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” many features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there, specifically the local advice he receives. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the frustrated feelings the cyclist has towards the old men in hindsight. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and nearly died from hourly dehydration pangs. Also, the overwhelming lack of people and civilization affected the author deeply. There was no one around that he could ask for help from, amplifying his isolation. “...but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none, compounding his desperation. Finally, the pervasive lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist’s physical and mental state. “That smoky blues tune ‘Summertime’ rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This vividly describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up from the strain. However, his intense need for water ultimately makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or his goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park, showing his resilience against the setting's challenges.
1610	7592	3	3	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways, shaping his mental state as he progresses. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, becoming rougher and more difficult, he becomes more and more distraught. He sees the sign that says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” and it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him and his slow, arduous pace on a bicycle. The ironic warning feels like a cruel joke in his situation. Also, when the rider says “In an ironic twist that should please all sadists…” he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing but further hardship from the journey ahead, highlighting his growing cynicism and despair fostered by the unforgiving environment.
1611	7593	3	3	In the story I read, the setting is a big factor to the effect on the cyclist. For example, it talks about how the cyclist sees the sign that says, “Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This immediate environmental cue forces the cyclist to be cautious, compelling him to slow his pace and pay closer attention to the deteriorating path. The setting thus directly dictates his actions and imposes a physical demand for greater care and control over his bicycle. This interaction shows how the physical landscape actively shapes the cyclist's experience and required response.
1612	7594	3	3	The cyclist was in a horrible, nasty environment for cycling, characterized by relentless heat and desolate, empty roads. But the thing that really threw the cyclist off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle and no one around to give him updated directions. The oppressive heat made him drink more water and also made it harder to breathe in the extreme conditions. These compounding difficulties created a severe physical strain. Without those critical faults in his environment and preparation, the cyclist would have been fine, but as it was, the setting presented an overwhelming challenge.
1613	7595	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. He had no water, so he was parched and physically drained. Furthermore, there was a huge snake that took up half of the road, presenting a sudden and dangerous obstacle, and there wasn’t a building in sight to offer refuge. So the setting affected him with doubt and fear, but he had the confidence of getting where he needed to go. Then, when he finally arrived at his destination, it was a sign of immense relief. That is how the setting affected his journey, testing his resolve before granting him reprieve.
1614	7596	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the intense heat, as he was cycling through a desert and mountainous region. Also, because he didn’t follow his plan on the map, he had no clue where he was, and the anxiety of the whole situation took a toll on his physical well-being, exacerbating his fatigue. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed, was completely deserted. He had no idea where any people were, so that isolation had to stress him out significantly. This mentally taxed him, and he genuinely thought he was going to die, which is not good for anyone’s state of mind. He really should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore, as maps don’t go crazy and they don’t really get outdated. Maps don’t lie to you, so he has obviously learned a crucial lesson about preparation and self-reliance.
1615	7597	3	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist significantly. Differing from flat land to miniature hills to busy highways is kind of hard to cope with, demanding constant physical adaptation and different levels of exertion. This was especially challenging considering he was already dehydrated and had no water, which sapped his energy and made each new topographical feature a greater test of his endurance. The relentless variation in the environment thus compounded his physical distress throughout the journey.
1616	7598	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals, and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently on his journey after following “their advice,” reasoning that the men sounded “no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town names."" The setting initially changes from cool to dry and barren with the mention of ""tumble weeds,"" and the landscape becomes increasingly harsh. It then changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path, creating a moment of intense peril. In the end, the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting, and he resolves to follow his own map from then on, having understood the folly of his initial overconfidence."
1617	7599	3	3	"The features of the environmental setting are affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place, along with the setting there are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are interfering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usual as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot, blazen, scorching desert. In addition to this, he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat; plus, he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction, and because of this, he is getting more panicky as his supply of water is running extremely low. An instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June (Joe Kurmaskie)."" Another example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June (Joe Kurmaskie)."" The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s anxiety, yet strangely, his confidence in himself grew as he became more panicky, focusing on sheer survival. An instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine (Joe Kurmaskie)."" In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways: it had exhausted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and lose his logical sense to make decisions; however, his loss of a clear sense of direction also gave him a desperate self-confidence as he strove to reach the service town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he could survive."
1618	7600	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist was when it got hot and the rider was running out of water, which created a dire physical threat. Another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,"" a thought which caused him to laugh bitterly at his own predicament. A third way the cyclist was affected was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down, finding a crucial respite from the oppressive heat outside. Lastly, he was affected when he rehydrated himself in the shop, regaining his strength and clarity of mind. So the setting was a main factor for the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite National Park, fundamentally shaping his difficult experience."
1619	7601	3	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through, a decision that would test his limits. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns, landscapes that offered no relief. That is when he started to get truly thirsty. At first, he wasn’t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning, a pleasant and energizing start. Once he got to the desert part with no water source, then he got thirsty and started to drink his water, which depleted fast under the relentless sun. The lack of a damp or shaded place can make you thirsty by itself, but after riding a while in the arid heat, it became bad, pushing him toward a crisis. The setting had everything to do with how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke, as the environment provided no resources for replenishment. That is how the setting profoundly affected the cyclist, turning his journey into a fight for survival.
1620	7602	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist's mood in the story, casting a shadow over his entire journey. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills, a physically demanding route that wore down his spirit. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless, as if he could not make any meaningful progress. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned Grape Factory, he felt one twist of many disappointments. He was extremely thirsty, and there used to be a building there; when the cyclist was at the fork in the road, he thought he could get some water, a hope that briefly lifted his mood. When this failed, the cyclist was even less determined, his optimism crushed. He felt like the world was against him, a sentiment directly fueled by the unforgiving and desolate setting surrounding him.
1621	7603	3	3	The oppressive settings profoundly affected the cyclist, because wherever he went it seemed to never end. Like when he was riding along the route the old men had told him to go, the landscape stretched on interminably. He went through a ghost town exactly as they said he would, but the empty windows and dust-choked streets offered no respite. Then he kept on going, pedaling further into the emptiness, but the journey never ended and the relentless summer heat started to get to him, pressing down with a physical weight. His mind began to falter under the sun's glare; like when he started to dehydrate near this old juice factory and started imagining that he was drinking juice, his thirst conjuring vivid mirages. So he started seeing things, his reality blurring with desperate hallucinations born from the heat and his isolation.
1622	7604	3	3	As the author cycles through this dangerous shortcut, he is trapped in a very perilous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June, a time of extreme heat. A desert makes the heat unbearable for the cyclist, with no shade for relief. Its just sun, sand, and him, a solitary figure in a vast, arid expanse. Then it tells the month; summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist soar to about one hundred degrees, almost maybe even hotter. This intense heat could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply far too quickly, a terrifying prospect. “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips,” highlighting his dire situation. Then there is the immense distance of his ride, stretching endlessly before him. The author is always saying “About twenty more miles” or “Twenty miles up the road,” phrases that emphasize the daunting scale of his journey. All of this hard work in such extreme conditions can easily cause heatstroke and kill him, making every pedal stroke a fight for survival.
1623	7605	3	3	The features of the setting like the desert, the sun, and abandoned towns affect the cyclist a great deal. The dry desert makes him feel as if he were riding forever, the sameness of the scenery distorting his sense of progress. And it probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a real, living town. The sun makes him even hotter than he already is; it beats down relentlessly, makes him sweat more, and makes him even more thirsty, sapping his strength with each passing mile. The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever going to make it to Yosemite, each empty building a symbol of failure. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy, mirroring his journey. He is content after riding to the first town, but then the rest of the towns are abandoned too and he starts to run out of water, and he thinks he is going to die, which makes it sad and desperate. Then he becomes profoundly happy and relieved when he finally finds the bait shop and finds life-saving water, his spirits lifting with his fortunes.
1624	7606	3	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout his journey. The story takes place in June in California, which is a very hot time of the year, especially in such a desert location. The extreme heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coherently as he could had he not been in a desert in June, his thoughts becoming muddled. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, uninhabited land, with no signs of life. The author says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” a statement that emphasizes the character's total lack of resources and profound isolation. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter from the punishing environment. The road itself was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills that demanded constant effort. Such terrain is much harder to maneuver, especially in such an already dire state of physical and mental despair. Ultimately, the harsh setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead,"" greatly impacts the cyclist, testing his limits at every turn."
1625	7607	3	3	There are a lot of things that affect the cyclist, such as the extreme heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long, exhausting trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot, the air shimmering with waves of heat. The narration says, “and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie), which means that he or she was very hot and dangerously dehydrated, facing a real mortal threat. The roads were very rough, for example, signs warned “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” (Kurmaskie). The roads became bumpy and uneven, and there were a lot of hills the cyclist had to go over, each ascent draining his remaining energy. There was no water either, no source to replenish his dwindling supply. So he/she was running out of energy and the combination of factors made the journey even harder, each challenge compounding the next. In the end, despite the overwhelming odds, the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water, a hard-won victory over the elements.
1626	7608	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker, baking the arid ground beneath his tires. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization, amplifying the sense of solitude. The narrator said, “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his life. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn’t have, making him dehydrate faster and parching his throat. The narrator says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of, with its vast, unforgiving landscape, made it so much worse that he had no water, pushing him toward a physical and mental breaking point.
1627	7609	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story and threatens his well-being. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out, highlighting his growing desperation. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme, relentless heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist's thirst and dehydration, sapping his strength with every passing mile. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt…, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” The rough roads and challenging terrain, full of gravel and steep inclines, also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite, extending his ordeal in the harsh environment.
1628	7610	3	3	The cyclist is profoundly affected by the features of the setting. The cyclist has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite, a route that proves more demanding than anticipated. Soon he is out of water and very tired, his body weakened by the journey, and he believes he will die soon in the isolated landscape. But then he finds a fish camp, a small sign of human presence, and goes in the bathroom to revive himself with water, a moment of critical relief. When he comes out a man is sitting on the porch, offering a human connection. The author gets directions from him and is happy that he is on the right track again, his hope restored by this fortunate encounter in the vast wilderness.
1629	7611	3	3	There are many effects of the setting in this essay that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on an empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, and no people for miles around. I am now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you are by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the natural energy and peace. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help; you are stuck because there's no one around to assist you. Another good thing is that you are being by yourself, @CAPS1 any cars. You don’t have to worry about getting hit so you’ll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride without traffic concerns. Another bad thing is there is no water available, so you might want to bring plenty with you to avoid dehydration. So whatever you decide to do, just be careful and think your idea through completely before embarking on such a solitary journey.
1630	7612	3	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world, a single figure in an immense, silent landscape. He knew there was no turning back once he started his adventure, committing fully to the path ahead. No one was there to help him, emphasizing his complete self-reliance. The environment made him realize the many risks involved in this adventure, from physical exhaustion to the lack of resources. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey, forging a determined spirit fueled by necessity and the will to persevere through the challenging terrain.
1631	7613	3	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along under the relentless sun. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory,"" a hollow and abandoned structure that offers no refuge. The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building, a monument to his own foolish misdirection. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain,"" a maddening and ironic soundtrack to his demise. At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He says “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth to stave off thirst. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he “drank deeply from the sink,” the life-giving water restoring his spirit. The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same profound hopelessness as the cyclist, proving how environment dictates the limits of human endurance."
1632	7614	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks which challenge his journey. First, he got information from the old people, which turned out to be unreliable. For example, when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones, leading him astray. Second, when he ran out of water his situation became critical. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out, sapping his remaining strength. Plus when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water come out, deepening his desperation. Last, when he finally got to a story the old guy had a map, which revealed the truth of his predicament. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said I have my own map, and it showed the cyclist was far off course. So therefore he knew he was in trouble, realizing the setting had conspired against him. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting, from misleading advice to arid landscapes, affects the cyclist and his perilous journey.
1633	7615	3	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways, primarily through its harsh physical demands. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills, creating a grueling path. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy; when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, “... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,” using his final reserves. By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy terrain and they effected him by taking up all his energy, leaving him physically drained and desperate. That is how the setting, with its relentless topography and heat, had effected the cyclist, dictating his struggle and consuming his vitality.
1634	7616	3	3	"In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted  Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affects the cyclist by dictating his emotional state. When at the old codgens house, he is confident in himself, because they have told how of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs to embark, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the settings changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. After ""about @NUM1 miles into te pedal"", the cyclist arrives at the first town, he has despair because it is a ghost town, a place devoid of life and aid; still having confidence, he lack of water, he continues on. After a couple more miles, he comes to small fork with a pump. Thinking its cool, water he goes and pump, he finds out it is @NUM2∞@CAPS1 and tastes like ""battery acid"", a crushing disappointment. Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around, his hope fading with each rotation. When he does find a town, with water, the setting to relieving and better for him because he find water, a salvation from his ordeal. In the end, the setting effect how the cyclist back against confident, then desperate as water is used, than relieved when water is found, charting his emotional journey through the landscape."
1635	7617	3	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert, a landscape inherently hostile to such an endeavor. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly, turning from adventure into a fight for survival. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly, leaving only a sense of profound isolation. It’s just an overall way setting to give lost in, a vast and unforgiving expanse where hope is as scarce as water, perfectly designed to challenge the human spirit.
1636	7618	3	3	The effect of cycling in such extreme heat is very dangerous and trending because a lot of things can go wrong. You can feel so hot that having and drinking water wouldn't cool you down; it simply didn't matter. But when a drop of that warm water landed in your mouth, it had the unpleasant flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. It was so hot that you are seeing things, like a mirage of a town. The heat was so intense that pouring a supposedly refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave him feeling utterly parched and desperate for relief from the oppressive conditions.
1637	7619	3	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident and energetic mood, until he arrived at a town that was completely deserted, which dampened his spirits. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the unsettling ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork which contained a ramshackle shed, some rusty and unclean pumps, and a small, empty corral. The desert was relentlessly hot and his lack of water was severely dehydrating him. As the text states, “This sight was troubling…I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills which demanded more effort and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless and desperate. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke, showing his profound despair. The features of the environment obviously greatly affected the mood and physical state of the cyclist, proving that sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called “easy way out.”
1638	7620	3	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at Body and Wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is optimistic, but as he rode into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town, which was disheartening. As he pedaled on, “The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it,” indicating his initial focus. At that time the weather is affecting him a lot but he keeps the mental image of Yosemite's cool pines and rushing rivers in his head to cope. He also only had a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big, demanding hill, which intensified his struggle against the harsh, arid landscape surrounding him.
1639	7621	3	3	The setting of this essay is to tell cyclists where to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people, as their directions may be outdated or unreliable. The narrative uses the environment as a map and a warning, illustrating how certain paths, while seemingly straightforward from another's perspective, can lead to difficult and unforeseen challenges. Therefore, relying on personal preparation and modern tools is far safer than following potentially misguided suggestions, no matter how well-intentioned they may be.
1640	7622	3	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist, as the setting was hot with rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” He meant that he needed water so much and the hill was so big and exhausting that the sight of potential refuge was a powerful lure. Also he says, “Summertime ‘rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain’.” It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song “Summertime” as a mental distraction. He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body and spirit completely. Furthermore, he says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” He is noting that the terrain is not only harsh but also deadly because of the dangerous snake that passed by him. He needed to show that with all these objections and hazards, he was determined to overcome anything. As you can see, the setting greatly affected the cyclist both physically and mentally throughout his arduous journey.
1641	7623	3	3	Many things can affect a cyclist, but in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot, a fact we know by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, “That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Because it was so intensely hot, this could make the cyclist dangerously thirsty and fatigued. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This constant climbing and descending would create physical exhaustion. We know there were many hills because in the text it says, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” Going over all those hills can really tire someone out, draining their energy reserves. A third feature of the setting would be nature, which can affect us in many ways by weather, by terrain, and as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake, this encounter making the journey dangerous and heightening the sense of peril. The setting can affect anything, and it would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during a different season, not June, altering all these challenging conditions.
1642	7624	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting is used to alter the cyclist's mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps describe the cyclist's hopeful situation. The idea of lush, cool water and vegetation gives the cyclist hope during his increasingly hellish trip, serving as a mental oasis. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equals a good outcome, a stark contrast to his current state. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusted pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope, and in fact at this point the cyclist becomes troubled by his situation. While pedaling through the desert, the cyclist becomes even more fatigued when a tumbleweed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, comes by, reinforcing his isolation. The use of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new, as there are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story, the author describes a desolate land filled with wild beasts to symbolize and cause a character to change his personality, surrounded by uncivilized people and creating a situation where he tears his clothes and hunts like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured, colonial world simultaneously causes and reflects on this profound change. Therefore, the setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is used as an important tool for character development.
1643	7625	3	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes “tumbleweeds crossed my path” it shows that he is most likely in the middle of a deserted nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is empty and isolated, enhancing the feeling of solitude. Also, when the author writes “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” and when he writes “a ridiculously large snake” show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could attack at any time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die, presenting a constant physical threat. Lastly, the name of the store is relevant because it is a fish bait store and he is desperately thirsty. This is relevant because fish live in water and he is thirsty, so seeing the sign relieves him completely by promising a potential source of aid. Therefore, through these details, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist.
1644	7626	3	3	The cyclist is faced with many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which is travelling through the California deserts. This was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, plus the author was riding his bike, making himself more thirsty and hot from the strenuous exertion. He also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback, which he carefully avoided even though it almost covered the entire road, adding a element of sudden danger. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills, which tested his endurance and resolve. Ultimately, the biker met all these challenges and progressed through them with considerable bravery, overcoming the harsh environment.
1645	7627	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit” many different settings took their toll on the cyclist. For example, in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride, but it was very hot, creating an immediate hardship. Then he began to get into a series of short rolling hills which were taking their toll on his legs, sapping his strength with each ascent. Then he entered into a rough area where he had to be more careful of the uneven ground. The roughness of the path probably wore him out from all the constant bumps and bounces, adding to his fatigue. He went through a lot on that bike trip, and who knows, he might have never made it back to where he was staying given the cumulative difficulty of the journey.
1646	7628	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, the text notes that “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy and causing fatigue to set in more quickly. Another example is the location described as “through the high deserts of California in June.” This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat, which saps his strength. Finally, the first three stops he made had no place to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip, increasing his physical distress. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder and more demanding.
1647	7629	3	3	One feature that affected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The text states “two miles into the section... I noticed the terrain changing.” This shift from a flat, predictable path to an undulating one forced the cyclist to constantly adjust his effort, expending more energy on the ascents and then bracing on the descents. This constant change in resistance, compared to a steady, flat ride, made the journey far more physically taxing for him as he progressed.
1648	7630	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot, which drains the cyclist's energy. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already, with intense sun and little shade. Third, there is not any civilization on the “shortcut” he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with, leading to severe thirst. This is how the harsh features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story, creating a significant challenge.
1649	7631	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because if it was windy too it would be hard for the cyclist to control the bike, fighting against the gusts. Also, if there were a lot of buildings and people outside there would be a lot of traffic, so they would not be allowed to let the cyclist go there and the cyclist would have to turn back, ending his journey prematurely. Then if it was a clear road and nobody was there and no buildings or houses were there then it would be an easy ride for the cyclist, allowing for uninterrupted travel. So as you can see the setting affects the cyclist in many ways, from the weather to the man-made environment.
1650	7632	3	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine and making good progress. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him, becoming oppressive. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate and increasingly weak. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and the store, finding relief. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct, showing how his perspective shifted with his circumstances.
1651	7633	3	3	If it’s a good day, the cyclist will want to ride, feeling the sun on their back and the wind as a welcome companion. If it is a bad day, then they will not want to ride but probably will anyway, driven by a sense of duty or a stubborn determination to not be defeated by poor conditions. This internal conflict between desire and obligation is a fundamental part of the cycling experience, where the decision to ride is often a compromise between one's mood and one's willpower, ultimately concluding that the ride itself is what defines the cyclist's day.
1652	7634	3	3	"In the essay, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, features of the setting affect the cyclist profoundly because there are old people who have been around for a long time. A cyclist cannot ask them for reliable advice because they are often too old to give accurate information and likely would not know what they are talking about, being disconnected from current routes and conditions. As Kurmaskie wryly observes, “A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, ‘Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.’” That statement perfectly encapsulates the features of the setting and provides a clear example from the essay on how local characters can mislead rather than guide a traveler."
1653	7635	3	3	"The features for the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead"" are not the kind of war one would be in at forts; it is a personal battle against the elements. I thought it was going to be a simple scenery story, but it turns out he was not that prepared for the harsh reality he faced. He took directions from some old-timers who had not left their house since Carter was in office, leading him astray. He was a bike pedaling through the California desert with only the things you can carry because you are on a bike, which proved insufficient. He ran out of water and could have gotten heatstroke or collapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat can drive you insane and make you thirsty, and you have to endure the bite of desperation. The conditions this biker was in were horrendous, and I do not think he was prepared at all, which teaches the lesson to always stick to your gut instinct when planning a journey."
1654	7636	3	3	In the story, the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings in sight, he had no water left, and he was utterly lost had a profoundly negative affect on the cyclist, causing him to doubt himself the whole time. This isolation and scarcity of resources created a mental battle that was as challenging as the physical one, filling his journey with anxiety and second-guessing. Although he did persevere and made it through the tough situation he was in, the experience underscored how deeply the features of a setting can impact a traveler's resolve and state of mind, proving that survival is as much mental as it is physical.
1655	7637	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the setting and the features significantly affect the cyclist, shaping his desperate actions. For example, in the story he says, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate.” This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperately thirsty unless it was very hot and arid out, pushing him to extreme measures. The setting and features of this story are that it takes place in California, on a brutally hot day. Another quote that could support this is when the author says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” This shows that it is hot because he is sweating profusely, and it also could show that it is scorching because he thinks it’s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert where the heat distorts reality, confirming the oppressive nature of the environment on his journey.
1656	7638	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight, just an empty and monotonous landscape. This isolation and lack of visual progress made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in a later paragraph, the cyclist saw a building appear on the horizon, which helped him to gain strength and renew his focus to reach his goal. The cyclist’s determination went down as long as he was riding through the barren and featureless terrain. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself, serving as a tangible marker of his progress and a source of much-needed morale. This cycle of despair and hope, dictated entirely by the environment, illustrates the profound impact of the setting on his journey.
1657	7639	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. The harsh, sun-baked environment directly contributes to his physical decline. The quote, ""I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" proves the severe dehydration of the rider, showing how the setting impairs his basic motor functions. Furthermore, the thought, “The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke,” proves the time and energy of the rider is running out, as the extreme heat pushes him to the brink of physical collapse. These ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist are not just a backdrop but an active, dangerous force that threatens his well-being and challenges his endurance on the journey."
1658	7640	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the author takes a trail he had previously heard about, expecting a certain experience. After the ride didn’t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to “set in” with its true, unforgiving nature. The aridity of the climate, with its dry and relentless heat, would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the harsh conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with, a critical miscalculation for such a journey. This initial shortage, combined with the scorching sun beating down, would make him become dangerously dehydrated, compounding his physical struggles and highlighting the trail's severe challenges.
1659	7641	3	3	The cyclist runs into some pretty tough challenges during his journey. The various features of the setting affected him, because there were so many obstacles that he had to overcome. For example, he got directions from some old men who moved them along lively but didn’t really know what they were talking about, leading him astray. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink, and the road started to get bumpy and he saw snakes, increasing the danger and discomfort. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed, leaving him completely isolated. He came up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch’s Grape Juice factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, dashing his hopes for refuge. Towards the end he found this fish camp where he finally got water and was around people, which provided a crucial respite. These different obstacles affected his mood and how determined he was throughout the difficult ride, dictating his spirits.
1660	7642	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” has a great effect on the main character in the story, shaping his emotional and physical state. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first ‘town’ and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him with a sense of purpose. The line, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it,” shows his initial excitement. His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like “rushing” being encouraging to him and the pleasant environment boosting his morale. Then, he continues moving on the road, and the narrator states, “Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were as the landscape turns less welcoming. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn’t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt and saps his energy. Further along, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This profound isolation adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite, with the empty setting amplifying his fear. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him by making him feel completely alone. Then he said “over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.” It is at this point that he uses the word “crippling” because he is just about exhausted and can’t go any further, and the sight of the structure becomes a potential turning point, demonstrating how the setting's features directly influence his capacity for hope and endurance.
1661	7643	3	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist as he navigates a challenging and intimidating landscape. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town, with its crumbling facades and eerie silence, that makes him feel profoundly weird and uneasy. After that he starts to ride through the vast, open desert when a huge, coiled snake suddenly gets in his way and scares him even more, causing his heart to race. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory, its rusted machinery and dusty interior a testament to its decay, he is almost completely out of energy and almost can’t go on any further in his journey, his legs feeling like lead, until he finally arrives at the isolated bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist, from the desolate town to the desert creature, but they all affect him by steadily draining his physical stamina and mental resolve.
1662	7644	3	3	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued without a building in sight, the endless, featureless horizon offering no hope of shelter or respite. This made him grow histerical over the situation, his mind conjuring fears of a lonely end, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself, wallowing in a pit of self-pity. Then when he finally did see a building, a small, weathered structure in the distance, he thought it was a mirage, a cruel trick played by the heat and his own desperate mind, and he hesitated to believe his eyes. This moment of doubt highlights the profound psychological toll the desolate environment had taken on him, leaving him wary of even potential salvation.
1663	7645	3	3	The location of a cyclist’s ride profoundly affects the person’s attitude and physical strength throughout the journey. If the road is full of steep, unrelenting hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed, quickly depleting one's energy reserves. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This shows how one gets emotionally and physically drained by hills, where even dark humor becomes a sign of exhaustion. Also, being in a harsh desert situation can severely weaken a cyclist due to intense thirst and exposure. The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked “brackish,” a clear sign of his deteriorating condition. So, whether through taxing terrain or a lack of resources, the setting can ultimately break a cyclist's spirit and body.
1664	7646	3	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler, creating a series of physical hardships that threaten his progress. He's running low on water, his bottle nearly empty, and he's almost dehydrated, his throat parched and dry. The weather where he's at is very, very hot, the sun beating down relentlessly, and he can't see a town for miles in any direction, leaving him isolated in the vast, arid landscape. This combination of heat, thirst, and isolation creates a formidable challenge that saps his strength and tests his will to continue, demonstrating the environment's powerful opposition.
1665	7647	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist significantly because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water left in his bottle, and a long, demanding way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated and lightheaded, the heat waves shimmering on the asphalt ahead. He also had to go over a lot of steep hills, which strained his muscles, and go through vast, sun-scorched deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a “shortcut” through a particularly barren area, but it ended up taking longer and he got severely dehydrated, a miscalculation that worsened his plight. This is how the setting, with its heat, difficult terrain, and his own dwindling supplies, affected him both physically and mentally on his arduous trip.
1666	7648	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a profoundly good way. For example, he would be in excellent physical shape because cycling is a demanding and continuous sport that builds endurance and strength. Furthermore, he would likely become rich because he would win the competitive contest of cycling, earning prize money and sponsorships. These positive outcomes demonstrate how a supportive environment can foster both personal health and professional success for an athlete, ultimately leading to a rewarding and prosperous life.
1667	7649	3	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, many obstacles are caused from the different settings, creating significant challenges for the protagonist. For example, the intensely hot temperature caused the character to get severely dehydrated, a condition he recalls by stating, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This physical distress caused a critical loss of determination, which led to him losing his consciousness and jeopardizing his journey. The formidable hills he had to cycle also negatively effected him, as the steep and relentless inclines caused him to become increasingly tired and weak and to lose his resolve and determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, this progressive loss of determination could eventually make him lose consciousness entirely, a fear he voices by saying, “if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.” Thus, the harsh environmental elements directly threaten both his physical well-being and his mental fortitude.
1668	7650	3	3	The setting of the story had profoundly effected the cyclist's journey becuse if it was in the suburbs he could have stoped any where and got water easily, but the plot was set in the middle of a vast desert where all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water eventually. For example, he had to go many miles to get to the next town to get a fresh supply of water, and if he was not in the challenging desert with its endless hills and sand, he could have made that journey in no time at all. The isolation and harsh terrain of the desert setting therefore directly intensified his struggle and prolonged his suffering.
1669	7651	3	3	The cyclist was significantly affected by many challenging features of the setting throughout his arduous journey. The initially flat road soon became a series of bumpy and steep hills, which were made exponentially harder to cycle because of his critical lack of water and the resulting fatigue. Furthermore, the relentless hot desert sun beat down upon him, and the complete lack of nearby towns and people also made the journey profoundly difficult and isolating. These combined environmental factors created a formidable test of his endurance and willpower.
1670	7652	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist primarily because it is excessively hot. It is hot enough that his precious water tasts like battery acid, making it difficult to consume. Then he has to deal with difficult trails and a confusing breakway, exacerbated when he said “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old and unreliable directions, leading him astray. Plus, what made the setting feel even hotter was the fact that he has been cycling nonstop without rest. Then, when he was riding, he found a mental escape by thinking, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” With him thinking about this refreshing destination, it momentarily made him forget about the oppressive heat. This interplay of physical hardship and mental refuge was precisely why the setting was so powerfully affecting the cyclist.
1671	7653	3	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was summertime in the California desert, a time of intense and unrelenting heat. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.” This tells you that the road is very rough and uneven. And being that he is on a bike, rough roads are not very good for him, making the ride jarring and difficult. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from, leaving him potentially lost. There is no one around to give him a drink of water, which is a critical need in such a harsh environment. These are a few of the many reasons why the setting so profoundly affects the cyclist and his challenging journey.
1672	7654	3	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, “I maneuvered down the hill,” indicating a steep and challenging descent. You also know that she starts off around no good water, as the available water was undrinkable. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid,” that shows the water was bad and provided no relief. Also the land is very hot because it says “in the heat of two hundred degrees,” creating an oppressive and draining atmosphere. Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite’s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid, a combination that tested her resolve to the very limit.
1673	7655	3	3	There are many things that could affect the cyclist. Like when they said, “tumble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake,” showing how the desert landscape presented unexpected and startling obstacles. Another example would be when they said “Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This shift in the land required more effort and energy to pedal through, directly impacting the cyclist's stamina and progress. The changing features of the setting, from wildlife encounters to the physical lay of the land, are how the environment continually affects the cyclist throughout the ride.
1674	7656	3	3	"The story of the cyclist shows how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist had to go through a lot, facing numerous challenges along the way. ""The speed limit was posted, but the cyclist was doing a water depleting ride under the scorching sun. Sometimes life can feel so cruel,"" especially when confronting such harsh conditions. Despite the hardships, the cyclist loves to ride their bike and they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening, a moment of peace that contrasted with the day's struggles. This love for cycling provided the motivation to persevere through the difficult journey."
1675	7657	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees provided a mental escape, as “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" Thinking about that pleasant destination helped the cyclist keep going through the difficult patches. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said “rough road ahead.” The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park, demanding greater physical exertion. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Not having a lot of water is really bad when you're outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandoned or a “ghost town,” empty and offering no resources. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help, feeling completely isolated. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park, each one shaped by the challenging features of the setting."
1676	7658	3	3	The older men gave him directions that were actually really bad, leading him astray on a route they had not traveled in decades. Nature wasn't on his side, that's for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the oppressive, unrelenting heat. Secondly a venomous snake blocked his path and he didn't want to tempt it, forcing a long and anxious detour. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere, with no one to come to his aid. Also he kept going in circles to abandoned buildings that offered no respite. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his parched throat, a desperate trick that backfired. He was then lead to a desolate bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere, a place of false hope where he had no way of getting home and his ordeal continued.
1677	7659	3	3	The features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. The dry desert landscape affected the cyclist because there was no water to be found and the cyclist was severely dehydrated, his body weakening with every mile. The strong, punishing heat was another factor, because the cyclist could barely pedal and had a real risk of a heat stroke. The animals presented a clear danger because the snake could have killed the cyclist and there was no one in miles to help had he been bitten. In the story it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind,” which underscores the absolute isolation. If the cyclist had needed immediate help then he could most likely have died, as rescue was a distant possibility. If I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I’m glad the cyclist didn't, showing a resilience against the harsh environment. The features of the setting affected the cyclist significantly because of the many perilous things that could have happened to him in such an unforgiving place.
1678	7660	3	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the intense, dry heat because he was getting lost on the confusing backroads and he was slowly running out of his precious water supply. The cyclist said, “That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office”. This means that because the cyclist followed their outdated and inaccurate advice he got lost in the vast desert and was running very low on water, his situation growing more desperate. He was so desperately thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to create saliva and keep him from thinking about water, a testament to his suffering. In the end the cyclist learned a valuable lesson to trust the map and the road signs instead of listening to really old people who haven't left their homes in years and were disconnected from the current reality of the land.
1679	7661	3	3	The setting of the desert is a hard, unforgiving setting to be in with no ready water or hope of help. If the author would have been on a populated trail with water fountains and shade, he would have been perfectly fine. But, he was in the stark desert with no one around, the air hot and dry, with no water, and no shade for relief. “tumbleweeds crossed my path” describes the emptiness and his loneliness because no one was in the desert to help him or offer directions. The harsh setting could have easily killed him if it was not for the chance discovery of the fish camp, which provided a crucial reprieve. The setting had a huge and dangerous affected on the author, shaping his entire difficult journey and highlighting his vulnerability against the elements.
1680	7662	3	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around for supplies there is now water to be found. In the story is says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means the cyclist was critically short on water and desperately needed to find a town soon to refill. Cycling in the barren desert and up and down the steep hills made the journey harder and the temperature feel even hotter. The heat could cause severe dehydration or a dangerous heatstroke because it says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” a fear that became very real. The buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they were abandoned and had no water, offering only shade and disappointment. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found his salvation, water in the sink of the bathroom, a moment of profound relief. The story says, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This is where the setting changes for the better because the cyclist found cool, life-giving water finally, ending his immediate crisis.
1681	7663	3	3	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a thriving town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town, with dilapidated buildings and an eerie silence. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water, his supply dwindling to a few last drops. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed without warning. It became hilly and very inconsistent, with sharp inclines followed by brief, jarring descents. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot, sapping his strength with every pedal stroke. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down the other side, his body aching. He was exhausted, completely spent from the effort. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist’s physical state, but his mood and determination as well, testing his resolve to continue the journey."
1682	7664	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake,"" this quote made it seem like he is in the middle of nowhere and is uncovering no place because the man on the porch said it would not be too far, fostering a false sense of security. The first town also was empty, and when he saw the town from a distance he was excited to go and feel a little relief, but when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time, with dust blowing through the silent streets. So he was forced to keep going, and the empty town made him feel almost hopeless, crushing his initial optimism. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that is how the setting most affected the cyclist in the way that it did, shaping his emotional journey through isolation and disappointment."
1683	7665	3	3	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state, his throat becoming dry and parched. “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so,” he thought, trying to maintain hope. The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy, each ascent a struggle that drained his legs. Because there was no buildings for miles he broke the ride into short distances, focusing on reaching the next bend or a lone tree in the distance just to keep his spirit from breaking entirely.
1684	7666	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. Some ways the cyclist was affected is, the lack of water was the biggest problem he had, a constant and pressing concern. The group of the old guys that gave him directions weren't a big help at all, their memories faded with time. The men gave the cyclist directions based on what they remember when they were younger in age, from a different era entirely. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him, their confidence momentarily convincing. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination, a clear goal in mind. As he began to get hotter and more thirsty, he started thinking about giving up, his resolve weakening with every mile. As soon as he was about to give up, his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now, a sudden turn of fortune. He stumbled across water, a blessed discovery that renewed his hope and allowed him to continue.
1685	7667	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water, a dire situation in the heat. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (Kurmaskie), a meager reserve that heightened his anxiety. Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men's directions that got him nowhere because their directions were out of date, leading him to abandoned places. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,” (Kurmaskie), he realized too late. He was given bad directions and wasn't too pleased, feeling a mix of frustration and foolishness for trusting them. Therefore the cyclist went through some tough times, his journey becoming a test of endurance against the misleading and unforgiving landscape.
1686	7668	3	3	Different features of the settings profoundly affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the harsh desert, has a significantly negative affect on the character. The desert land is baron and unforgiving, leaving him only with his small, precious supply of water. During his arduous journey he runs out of water, a critical event causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme, relentless heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate vividly. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, a vision which cruelly interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a devastating mirage. The lengthy road also severely affected the trip. The immense length and punishing roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down both mentally and physically, defeating his spirit. Ultimately, the hostile environment proves to be an overwhelming adversary.
1687	7669	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks, after a nice afternoon in a pleasant campground, that a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice, relaxing alternative to taking the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot, proving far more difficult than anticipated. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him, recalling their advice. He says, “The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He did conscientiously conserve his water but the town was very old and desolate and didn’t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water, suffering from thirst, until he finally got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected, transforming from a relaxing detour into a struggle. It was more depressing and challenging than he could have imagined, teaching him a hard lesson about the land.
1688	7670	3	3	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist would be that the setting affected him because its features were based on a harsh and deceptive reality. So that would be a primary reason how it would be affected, as the environment directly challenged his plans and well-being. Because there are differences in the stories and the actual conditions encountered, the cyclist's experience was shaped by this disconnect. The physical hardships imposed by the setting, therefore, had a tangible impact on his journey, leading to a difficult and enlightening outcome about the power of place.
1689	7671	3	3	You cannot always choose your environmental features because your initial idea might be changed over time by experience. The setting one encounters can forcefully alter preconceived notions and plans, demonstrating that external conditions have a powerful influence on personal outcomes. This interaction between an individual and their surroundings ultimately dictates the course of events, showing that adaptability is often necessary. Therefore, the features of a setting are not passive but active elements that shape one's journey and perspective.
1690	7672	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively, creating a complex interplay of challenges. For instance, he had been at CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This vivid image affected the author mentally, making him acutely remember he had no water, which tormented him. Which inturn affected him physically by worsening his condition as he became more dehydrated with each passing moment. So overall that setting features had a negative, direct affect on the cyclist, deepening his despair. Another example is, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This scene affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again, inducing a sense of hopelessness. It also affected him physically because the little water he found tasted like ""battery acid,"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state and physical decline. This setting features had a profoundly negative affect on the cyclist, eroding his resolve. The setting features and how they affected the cyclist is analogous to an environment a person is advised in and how it shapes their character and trials, ultimately defining their experience."
1691	7673	3	3	He is going on a journey on his bike across a demanding landscape. He has to go down steep hills and deal with the pressing fact that he has no water, a situation that grows more urgent with each passing mile. That is basically what the setting is about, establishing a simple yet challenging environment for his ride. The journey's difficulty is defined by these two core elements of terrain and resource scarcity.
1692	7674	3	3	When riding a bike the features around you can profoundly affect the cyclist's physical state and mental resolve. Some primary things that can affect the cyclist are the immediate weather and the surrounding scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding, facing discomfort and reduced visibility. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad, such as slippery roads, will make the cyclist second guess the decision of riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and become even more exhausted from the relentless heat. The scenery can also significantly affect the cyclist's morale. When a cyclist is riding and all he or she sees is a barren desert then they might have doubts on where they are going, feeling isolated. If there are abandoned buildings everywhere the cyclist might become frightened and want to head back or lose hope, as shown in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” when the rider gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things in the environment can affect the cyclist, shaping the entire experience of the journey.
1693	7675	3	3	"The features of the setting consistently exacerbate the cyclist's difficult situation. The intense June weather added to his critical water depletion, being the beginning of summer when temperatures soar. When the cyclist arrived at the first so-called ""town"" it was completely deserted, and the water he found there had a disgusting quality, making it undrinkable. The author uses verbal irony when labeling it a ""town,"" having it not really be a functioning town anymore but a ghost of one. The large snake presented an air of immediate danger and another abandoned structure, the Grape Juice Factory, added to the hopeless, lost tone of the narrative. These elements collectively create a setting that is both physically threatening and psychologically draining for the protagonist."
1694	7676	3	3	Many things in the setting directly affect the cyclist and his journey. The first thing that profoundly affects him is the oppressive heat. The heat is actually what causes the central conflict in the story of the cyclist desperately needing water. If the heat was not present in the story then the cyclist would not have such a pressing need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without the constant fear of dehydration. Another crucial aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist, demanding great physical effort, and cause him to need more water to recover. If these hills were gone then the cyclist would have tired less quickly, making his journey significantly easier. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist, proving that the environment itself is a primary antagonist in his quest.
1695	7677	3	3	"The features of the setting in, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" affect the cyclist in many ways, both physically and psychologically. After following the old men's advice he sets off on his journey with some initial optimism. After the first town appears the sun really starts to beat down which really affects the cyclist, sapping his energy. In the essay it says “The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He may have not noticed it yet, but then later on the long winding road across the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is really dangerous in weather that hot. The text states, “The speed limit was fifty-five. I was doing a water-depleting nineteen.” In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is dangerously out of water. Furthermore, in this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures that pose a direct threat. In the story it says, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This entry proves to the reader that there are hazardous snakes in this sort of arid setting. The features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” from the climate to the wildlife, affects the cyclist greatly throughout his arduous trip."
1696	7678	3	3	The terrain setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The fact that he was in a vast, barren desert made him intensely thirsty. There were no towns or any sign of water to quench his growing thirst. The relentless hills he would descend and then ascend on his bicycle just made him more physically tired and drained. These are the significant effects the setting had on the cyclist, ultimately shaping his difficult journey.
1697	7679	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed” by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces severe problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding under a scorching sun, and the heat was so intense that the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired, and he was running out of his precious water supply. Because it was so oppressively hot, the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was losing while biking. Furthermore, the steep hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by forcing him to use more energy and liquid just to keep going. If it had been a cool and breezy day, he would have had no problem making that distance. Similarly, if the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns, then he would have had access to water to drink and could have continued his ride with ease.
1698	7680	3	3	"Everybody experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a simple bike ride towards Yosemite National Park, but when some elderly men told him about a shortcut, his adventure had just begun for the worse. First of all, every ""town"" and ""building"" the men told him he would come to wound up being completely deserted and lifeless. At first, this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph, when he came to his first deserted town, he simply ""chuckled, checked [his] water supply, and moved on."" @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water supply decreased alarmingly. He was then in a state of desperation for a functioning town. On top of that, in the story he wrote, he noted that ""the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This change in terrain made his biking much harder, and he was then becoming dangerously dehydrated. He finally found a town with water, but he had learned a hard lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men, a mistake he would not make again."
1699	7681	3	3	"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot during his journey. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a “shortcut” to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to immense thirst, and no park in sight. The narration states, “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1)."" This particular feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him profoundly, as the cyclist comes to the first “town” but only finds yet again no water, and is instead taunted by a picture of something that makes him even more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless and arduous journey. Another feature that would affect the cyclist is the complete lack of trees or shade along the route. The only thing he could feel was the relentless sun beating down on his back. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1)."" This physical evidence of his struggle also makes the cyclist firmly believe that old men do not know what they are talking about."
1700	7682	3	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."" The time of year affected the cyclist because it’s mid-June, @CAPS1. Furthermore, the specific region affected the cyclist because mid-June in Arizona is extremely hot and dry, creating a harsh environment. If the ride was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or in a cooler climate, it wouldn’t be as bad and you would not have the same danger of heat-related struggles. @CAPS1, when the terrain changed from flat ground to rolling hills, this also affected him significantly because it made it much harder for him to ride and required greater exertion. These are some of the key features of the settings that negatively affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit,"" demonstrating the power of environment over human endurance."
1701	7683	3	3	"In ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the harsh features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist. Because he was cycling through the desert of California in June, his water supply was quickly depleted and his hope began dwindling when he came across a desolate ghost town. His desperation grew until he found a water pump, but it only produced a tar-like substance, which deepened his despair. As a result of the desert's extreme conditions and the critical lack of water, he felt so defeated he wished he was dead. This harrowing experience led him to decide never to take advice from strangers again and to trust his map exclusively. That is how the environmental features ultimately affected his journey and his resolve."
1702	7684	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist both physically and emotionally. First of all, he was traveling in the desert, which means it was very dry and arid. This meant that the cyclist could not readily refill his water bottles and was slowly getting dehydrated under the relentless sun. Also, the cyclist was biking in the oppressive heat, which meant that he was continuously sweating, a process that also depleted the water from his body and played cruel tricks on his mind. Finally, the steep hills caused him to exert more energy, furthermore making him more and more dehydrated with every arduous climb. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a great deal of inner strength and sheer determination just to keep going, affecting him emotionally. Overall, the setting had a comprehensive physical and emotional effect on him, testing his limits in every way.
1703	7685	3	3	The cyclist is alone, traveling on a flat land at first, following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in California. During his travels, he becomes severely dehydrated while cycling over endless hills and deserts with the sun beating down on him in the hot June weather, and he realizes he could get a heat stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely, and when he finally sees buildings which turn out to be merely ghost towns, he briefly recovers his spirit and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist, in a fortunate turn, eventually found a camp site which served to save him from passing out in the desert, a place where he could finally rest, get life-saving water, and then carry on his journey using his own map for reliable guidance.
1704	7686	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist said the old men looked as though they, “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about twenty miles along on his journey. While looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” he was instead traveling through a barren and featureless desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This type of bleak setting could really bring down a cyclist’s mood, especially while thinking of the beautiful Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate, creating a stark contrast between his dream and his reality. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better, but this journey was defined by its hardships.
1705	7687	3	3	The setting affected the performance of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist throughout his difficult journey. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fatigued and thirsty because he had to put considerably more effort in to get over them. As he struggled, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” The long, big hills that he had to go up not only made him more thirsty, but probably made him feel more satisfied when the climb was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; it was abandoned and rusty, but the sign featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This cruel sight brought his hopes down considerably, yet he continued to move on despite the disappointment. In my own life, I have never had such an extreme experience where I had to keep pushing and urging myself toward a goal, but the closest I have come involves situations where the more I near my objective, the more distractions get in the way to try and stop me.
1706	7688	3	3	"The short story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" follows a man bicycling through Yosemite who asks a group of elderly men for directions. They lead him onto an ""old"" shortcut that takes him through a landscape of tough terrain and subjects him to extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story. For example, when the bicyclist came to a completely deserted area, he observed that ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" By this point in his journey, he was malnourished and in desperate need of water. This extreme thirst resulted in a particularly cruel moment when he passed an abandoned Welch’s grape juice factory. He saw an advertisement featuring a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice into his mouth. He notes, ""In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,"" before going into detail about its dilapidated state. His mood and feeling by this time was utterly tired and worn out, and the mocking advertisement did not help the situation at all. The author's mood did change with the setting, and before it eventually got better, it became significantly worse, highlighting the profound impact of the environment on his mental state."
1707	7689	3	3	"The young cyclist began his day confident and looking forward to his day of riding across California. He started with a carefree spirit, ready for anything and barely noticing the initial effects of his surroundings. He writes, ""I checked, checked my water supply & moved on. The sun was beginning to heat down, but I barely noticed it."" At this early stage, the surroundings have little effect on him. Later on, however, as he recognizes he has been directed wrongly, his mood begins to change. He realizes his water was going down and he is getting increasingly tired, his mood shifting to one of exhaustion and dejection. It is here that he writes, ""I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles & stuck them in my mouth with any luck I’d hit a bump or lodge one in my throat."" This sarcastic and grim action shows he has become saddened by the hopelessness of his journey. Eventually, he finds relief as the cold water helps to bring up his spirits and restore his sense of humor, marking the final shift in his emotional journey."
1708	7690	3	3	In the essay, the features of the setting profoundly affected the cyclist throughout his journey. In the beginning, the setting was at the old men's place where the cyclist was happy and confident about the route he was given. When he reached the desolate ghost town and found himself out of water, his emotional state turned to one of upset and frustration. The sight of a building initially offered a moment of relief, but upon discovering it was an abandoned factory, his hope vanished and he was filled with sadness. This series of environmental disappointments culminated in his final push, and when he finally reached the store, he was excited and profoundly relieved to have found sustenance and an end to his ordeal. That is how the specific features of the setting affected the cyclist's emotions and resolve during his difficult trip.
1709	7691	3	3	Weather, places, and the will to continue are all reasons that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the weather affects the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and sweat a great deal, making it physically hard to pedal. The constant, sunny hot weather also affects his mental state and will to ride, as the oppressive heat is demoralizing. I mean, come on, who wants to ride when it's burning hot outside? Furthermore, the specific places the cyclist went through, like the abandoned towns and the rough, unpaved roads, would affect him because navigating such terrain is pretty tough and isolating. These combined environmental factors work together to challenge both his physical endurance and his mental determination.
1710	7692	3	3	The story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” tells of a biking trip gone wrong, but the story would not be as terrifying if it had happened in a different place. The setting plays a large role in creating the narrative's tension. The story begins on a pleasant summer evening, but as the man bikes further, he arrives at a ghost town devoid of all life, which introduces a sense of unease. Later, a feeling of doubt sets in when he arrives at a location described as “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” Further on, we see panic begin to set in as the terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross his path, evoking the harshness of a cold western. Finally, all hope seems lost when he reaches the grape juice factory and finds only “a sand blasted picture of a young boy,” a cruel reminder of his thirst. The setting is a powerful tool which greatly influences the cyclist's experience and emotional descent throughout the story.
1711	7693	3	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclists physical abilities. The features affected his abilities because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is, “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This encounter with the snake highlights the physical challenge of navigating a hazardous landscape while already weakened. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much closer to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops, “.distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that I could move it that far, I’d be fine.” In the story, ""Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both the cyclists physical and mental abilities, pushing his body to its limits while also fueling his will to continue."
1712	7694	3	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water and he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. He was tired and dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and then two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel.” These hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily, exclaiming, “I could make that!” But after the terrain change he loses hope and almost doesn’t make it, thinking, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The sudden shift from manageable flat land to exhausting inclines directly triggers his despair. It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cyclist, demonstrating how the physical landscape directly shapes his mental state."
1713	7695	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills, which required much more effort to pedal. It was a hot day in June and he had a sparse water supply with him, increasing his vulnerability to the heat. He was pedaling through the deserts of California, a vast and exposed landscape. The last thing that effected him was that there wasn’t very many places to stop for water, leaving him isolated and without resources. These combined factors—the difficult terrain, the intense heat, and the scarcity of water—all worked together to challenge the cyclist both physically and mentally throughout his journey.
1714	7696	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremely out of date and haven’t left their porch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. On his journey the cyclist says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated, sapping his strength. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills, which present a formidable physical barrier. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isn’t any hope of him getting out alive, as the relentless climbs drain his energy and morale. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrate a rider and create a profound sense of hopelessness, directly impacting the cyclist's experience.
1715	7697	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more desperate the situation the more determined he becomes. On page one, he thinks, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Right after he thinks this he climbed away from the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams, showing a resurgence of will. He says on page one that his “troubles, thirst and teen were all behind me,” this shows that after a desperate situation the narrator feels relieved of all earthly obligations, as if he has passed through a trial. Not only does the setting affect the cyclist but the entire story around him, as the harsh environment shapes the narrative's conflict and the character's ultimate sense of release and perseverance. The landscape acts as both an antagonist and a catalyst for his personal journey.
1716	7698	3	3	The setting of the story is very dry and humid, flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, as “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Joe Kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a desert-like surrounding during June, with nothing surrounding him, is a scary thought. The heat and lack of water affect him significantly, causing him to possibly see mirages or even faint because of the heat and how much fluid he has lost through dehydration. The hills don’t help any either, adding physical strain to his already difficult journey through the harsh environment.
1717	7699	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June, yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is constantly thirsty, but he doesn’t have a lot of water to drink, and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot, intensifying his need for hydration. Also, in the story it says he comes to Welch’s Grape Juice Factory where on the side of the building he sees a picture of a “young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.” This makes the cyclist even thirstier, taunting him with the image of the drink he cannot have, but he continues on to find water at a bait shop, pushing forward despite the mental and physical challenge.
1718	7700	3	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First come the windy roads. As he goes along, his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. “Not many miles into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is overwhelmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before giving up, he found a place to get water and to relax. “Then, as easily as running about, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” This shows that he was strong and determined to survive, and he finally found what he needed, which made him happy and gave him a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined to overcome their own difficult journeys.
1719	7701	3	3	It gave him a hard time, so he learned a lot of things from that; he knows that it is not always easy. It was not a big problem, but sometimes some small problems become bigger. Life is like riding a bike; you have ups and downs, sometimes you have problems, sometimes you get lost, but that is life and its inherent challenges. The experience taught him resilience and the importance of perseverance through all of life's varying terrain.
1720	7702	3	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally, a clear sign of the oppressive climate. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” I believe riding over these hills in the hot sun of a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist, draining his energy further. I believe the terrain very much affected him, proving to be a formidable opponent on his journey.
1721	7703	3	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist, primarily through the challenging terrain and altitude. For example, the cyclist is moving through the high deserts of California. This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult and adds to the physical strain. Then the cyclist notes that the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The hills would make the trip more demanding, requiring greater effort to pedal and maintain momentum. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one of them as a long, crippling hill, a description that underscores the grueling nature of the ascent. Clearly, the terrain, which got increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist's progress and energy levels.
1722	7704	3	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, creating a harsh and unforgiving environment. For example, the condition of the road was bad, presenting a constant physical challenge. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads, which disrupted his rhythm and demanded more exertion. Furthermore, tumble weeds crossed his path, creating obstacles that required careful navigation. He had a lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid, which made staying properly hydrated a miserable experience. In the story it says, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” a statement that directly shows how his physical capabilities were compromised by the setting's harsh conditions. These combined elements of the environment significantly hindered his journey.
1723	7705	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by introducing demanding physical obstacles that complicate the journey. The challenges are evident if you have to go up hill or along long bumpy type roads, both of which require increased stamina and concentration. Then in the essay it says “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,” a warning which does make things more difficult than average by forcing a slower, more cautious pace that prolongs the effort. This difficult travel is compounded by external factors, especially with a lack of water to make things worse, creating a situation where the cyclist must contend with both the physical terrain and his own diminishing resources. Ultimately, the setting presents a series of interconnected hardships that test the cyclist's endurance.
1724	7706	3	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park by presenting multiple environmental dangers. First of all, the cyclist says he’s in Lodi, California on a “gorgeous day in June.” It’s very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke, making the heat itself a serious threat. Also, he is in the middle of the desert, where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path and a large snake that is possibly poisonous in the way. Such encounters add a layer of constant vigilance and potential peril. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more, leaving him isolated and vulnerable. So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist by combining extreme heat with hazardous wildlife and a lack of resources.
1725	7707	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist profoundly, particularly through the scarcity of resources and the demanding landscape; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip, a constant and pressing concern. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, “over one crippling hills,” and with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn’t careful, creating a vicious cycle of exertion and resource depletion. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclist uses his water, as he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he’ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal several more miles to the next town with very little water, a situation that heightens his desperation. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclist acts, forcing him into a careful calculus of survival especially with no water available in the desolate environment.
1726	7708	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the cyclist, whose journey is a continuous emotional response to the harsh landscape. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to, his determination increases and decreases, charting a course of peaks and valleys in his morale. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, a stark contrast to the desolate plains, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building, propelled by the promise of shelter or resources. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, a small but significant victory, he drank from the sink as his hope of not dying was renewed, the simple act of quenching his thirst restoring a fundamental sense of possibility. Conversely, the vast, empty stretches of road and the relentless, unforgiving sun served to drain his spirit, making every turn of the pedals a monumental effort. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting, demonstrating how his internal state was inextricably linked to the external world through which he traveled. Ultimately, the narrative illustrates that in an environment defined by scarcity and isolation, even the most minor feature of the landscape can become a powerful catalyst for either profound despair or a fragile, yet essential, hope.
